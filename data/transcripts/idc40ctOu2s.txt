grateful thanks again for the invitation to come and talk to you all today about the carpentry is what it is what it's like at the University of Michigan I'm often the med school like many of you and so we don't do a whole lot of teaching and so for me at least being involved in the carpentry is kind of satisfies that itch of working with people that don't have much programming experience and trying to kind of raise the bar as it were and we've got a great group of people here at the University Michigan that have been involved in this and I'm just a fearful leader as it works and as I see more and more of them walk in the room I get more nervous that puppies mad of what I'd say so you have this existential problem that I see as a scientist so my lab primarily does DNA sequencing and DNA sequence analysis we are heavily involved in microbiome field when I go to give talks like this at other campuses at lunch with the graduate students I love to freak them out by saying who currently has a data problem always pans and I say who thinks they're gonna have less data in ten years right it's all it's just going to continue to compound our datasets are getting larger and they're getting more complicated unfortunately our curricula that we train these students with there's nothing in for data science it includes nothing to help them to really analyze that dig we trained them how to interpret a Western but we don't train them how to parse a festival and so when you look at curricula like Pibbs or other things that they're fantastic but we're really missing that element and when you start talking about adding things to a curriculum people are always saying well what are you going to remove and so this is kind of the big the big problem and so this is I got nicely encapsulated a lot of how I see a lot of bioinformatics work of course no one here has this philosophy but basically fishings not that hard programming is not that hard you can learn are you can Python in an afternoon it's not that big of a deal who cares if we throw around dark and will tell you that one of my sticks is all sit down at an IT meeting with other people from the basic sciences and somebody will start throwing out jargon I'll say I don't know what that is I just pick a a TL a three-letter acronym and I'll just say what is that and it kind of hopefully drives home the point to some people that you're used to talking at a certain level but when you have people that are just starting out with programming you've got to remember what it was like that first time you learn to code there the first time you learn to work with a computer so what I find and I train these people in my own lab whether they're coming out of undergraduate programs for to my lab and it's very good students or whether they're coming out of what lab do they got a PhD one more some of our informatics analyses the trainees are very hungry these types of opportunities they're also really hungry for getting meaningful teaching opportunities that most grad students when they TA a class are running a session section they're made grading they're making sure they don't you know students aren't burning down the building or studying you know chemical hazards it's not super meaningful they also have a very unique perspective on each other's needs and learning challenges right so there are these new people like the people coming to my lab who they know how to run a gel they know how to do PCR but they're just they remember what it was like to figure out how do you move around to command huh to get to a directory where you want to be on to your desktop something that's perhaps very far removed from many of us in this room they also don't want to just be biologists right so being just a biologist so to speak and I'll just tell you that in software carpentry we're all data crafters your world the word just is not allowed because no one is just anything and so you know they don't want to just be a biologist that they want to bring the computational aspect they want to be more well-rounded they want to get more experiences than than doing bench science or doing the research slippin and so the big question going back to that's essential questions is how do we scale the number of people who can work with data that sure like one solution you know we might say as well we just need to hire more bioinformatics ists that we can then deploy them to answer all these questions I get emails from lots of people saying hey Pat can you help us analyzing this microbiome data because we're swamped with all the other stuff we've done and I'm like well I'm swamped with all the stuff ideas right and so there just aren't enough people to go around and to help do this analysis and so it really is important that we train the scientists in the lab to work with the data and so what's come up through this is there's many things out there but what you know we might think of like Codecademy or things like that but within the academic world which has really been taking off is this organization called the carpentry it's a umbrella term for three organizations called software carpentry data carpentry and library carpentry for the longest time it was always software carpentry and so I will frequently slip and say software carpentry but data carpentry is a sibling organization and then the library carpentry goes as well and as you might imagine library carpentry is really geared towards librarians it is an open global community that's goal is to teach researchers the skills to turn the data into knowledge and there's there's three big components of this that I'm going to talk about one is the curriculum what are we teaching and what are the skills that people need to develop as those research scientists a big part goes in to instructor training that I'm not I don't teach many workshops it's it's the trainees on the university that are teaching most of the workshops and then building a sense of community so our experiences with learning you might again go back to as you were learning to code might empathize with these statements that you know going to a course or workshop where they felt like they didn't belong right and there's many reasons why somebody might feel like they don't belong um so in tech it might be common because there's people speaking a jargon that is just opaque or you might be a woman in a room full of men or you might be the only minority person and so these are these are all problems that inhibit our ability to learn and and some of them have a lot to do with the extra content and some of them are purely so it securely more community-oriented and then you perhaps aren't likely to go back and do that right so if you have a bad experience with the workshop or you have a bad experience with a certain community you're not likely to go back there any time soon and so again establishing this community and what I think what the buzz phrase but this idea of a growth mindset that you can learn you can learn are I can teach you make I can teach you get and and you might even like it right so encountering approaching something with that mindset that you can do something is very different from saying this is scary I don't think I can do right so you say this is scary I don't think I can do it then well I remember the first time I started using the scheduler on flocks or whatever we use before flux it freaked me out because I was only used to running things from my computer and and I didn't want to learn something new dared me and so I kind of shut down and didn't want to do so I perhaps didn't use that resource because I didn't have that growth mindset and so there many instances where we run into this problem or we think I can't do this this is different this is weird I don't want to do it and so what we really try to do as we teach is that it's not so much about teaching someone to become proficient right so the goal isn't to make you a expert in R or Python or get the goal is to get you excited about learning our Python get bash what have you and helping you to feel like you're part of a wider community it's again the idea behind this growth mindset is the confidence that this is something you can do or continue to do and continue to learn um I don't know about you all but so I've been programming in our for a dozen years and I continue to feel like I'm learning new things right I'm part of that because how the Wycombe keeps churning out new packages but I also just learn new ways to put different bits of code together to do different and cool things but if I stop learning then there's gonna be a problem focus on efforts and incremental learning not the outcomes right so again the goal isn't taking huge leaps where you become the greatest programmer ever but that you make these incremental steps where you're gradually getting better and then see mistakes as opportunities for learning right that if you're not learning from a mistake then you're kind of wasting your time and you truly are spinning your wheels but that if you make a mistake or if you can receive a critique about some data visualization perhaps not being clearing or identifying a bug in your code then that's an opportunity to learn and it's really important to have this happen in we might think of as a safe space where you know you're not going to get ridiculed or laughter right so back over flow not a safe space it takes a special personality to be willing to go into Stack Overflow and ask what you might think it was like a beginner question I'm afraid and so within the carpet trees we work towards a growth mindset with what we consider to be an inclusive pedagogy and called forays that that pedagogy is accessible approachable aligned and active so in terms of accessible we make these available at a time in place where a person can attend it's welcoming there's a code of conduct that goes with every workshop we offer and we try to meet you proactive to ensure accessibility needs here at the University of Michigan we try to host our workshops across campus we try we're very open to people saying I'll bet step back and say that our work shops are had to be two days and it's all day on those two days and and so we we try to go where people are so you know we might teach in the libraries on main campus we might teach up at NCRC we might teach an engineering we want to go where people are we try to make it well welcoming with the code of conduct so kevin ensure that accessibility and inclusivity we also try to be approachable in our advertising recruitment feeling like the training is for you and that you're not going to be left out something that we really strive for at the university of michigan is that in general every workshop is taught by two instructors who tag-team you can maybe have up to four but it's really important to us as a group as members that we have at least one woman as an instructor and that we'll have helpers or you might think of as TAS but again half of our helpers are are also live because when we teach these workshops half of the learners are women like and so that's really important to try to get that that match as well as possible and so we try to again overcome activation barriers to getting started as we saw kinda connect my computer to the projectors installation is everything you know I'm trying to get get installed on a Windows computer it's not always revealed but you know we try to set up time for people to come in install their software and get going we do a lot of live coding as our instruction so you know I might be illustrating how to do a commit and get and you see that I might misspelled commit that's real right because I just did that this morning this well commit when I was doing a message and that's really right and so see having the people I think will learner see how we actually use the codes that we make mistakes that were not perfect that we introduced bugs that becomes part of the pedagogy so if you're getting these error messages you need to learn how to what an error messages right and that's something that you don't see in a book right if you pick up a book on get or are they don't really go over the Airman's because well who makes mistakes well everyone does um we try to be aligned with our learners and so this is a challenge because we we want learners from across people that are universally right we want people in digital humanities want people in engineering want people in biology and so it's very difficult to pick examples but aligned with those groups and so one of the things that we do is we have kind of these standard workshops that we teach over the course of the year but we'll also try to customize to different groups this is one of those people in epidemiology or genetics or social sciences I need to think about how we can align the learners interests with the examples that we have um the other thing is that our instructors are primarily graduate students and postdocs we have a few staff who are involved and and that's great we need all the help we can get that I feel like the instructors or the trainees are precious in a way because their current in the field they know the examples they know know what you know more of what what the cutting-edge things and DNA sequencing or versioning and also their peers right so if I get up in front of a room and I introduce myself as like you did that puts me at a very different level than unpatched loss of a postdoc and this is the floor because I'm a professor and not like this is the way things are you know it's much more top-down whereas if you're a peer in teaching it's much more horizontal align and approachable and as I mentioned with representation we do our best to attract diverse instructors to help teach these classes and this has been wildly successful it's all talked about and the fed one of the things that we do each year is we offer two workshops a year that are supported from advanced and women in science and engineering on campus and those are workshops that are taught by women or women actually don't say that they're only for women only women show up and and and that has been very inspirational to the people that come to those workshops because they just like for all these reasons and all the reasons you might expect and then they are very like they're very frequently it sent divides them to become instructors themselves and so they another thing is that we're teaching current tools and that we are aligning the code that we're using with other tools that were teaching so for example a couple of weeks ago we taught a workshop in the medical school that was kind of a prequel to a class doing genome assembly for bacterial genomes and so they were able to talk about command-line tools as they're introducing bash that are tied to various assemblers or snip colors or things like that the ACTU the the teaching is active like I said it's live coding that there's very little lecture there's very little say on a white board aside from drawing diagrams the commit stack looks like but it is it's live coding there's a lot of examples throughout the materials where we expect them to work on these examples a lot of paired program right where we say you know work on this then talk to your neighbor and then let's report back to the larger group of what you got the curriculum that we teach is open source and it's collaboratively updated to represent the current practices this is a blessing and a curse because if you can imagine potentially a thousand people editing or making pull requests do instructional materials the materials can get very unwieldy and very very long right so for something like teaching bash you know we might spend four hours in a workshop to teach bash but we might have 16 hours of content yeah carpentry is here you have like us okay yeah so so there is a carpenter ease website but there is central central repository everything's on github but there's a centralized curriculum that we all draw from and that's a dynamic curriculum so I might if I teach a workshop once or twice a year every time I go back to it gonna be subtly different and so there is a template so all the lessons look the same and and then again it's collaborative and that everybody is contributing to this and there are also people that are going off and creating new lessons that might not be part of what I think it was like a core workshop but that that might come in so for example Mary Ann Schmidt who has what have graduated gone to the postdoc in Texas put together border workshops related to reproducible research and dynamic literate literate programming things like our markdown documents and things like that that are kind of outside the scope of a typical art workshop but very much in the theme and keeping of what we do with the carpenters there are helpers that that float around and answer questions and help people get over little bugs one of the things that the carpentry is Dokes a lot about is that we imple use our sense of use of sticky notes and so at the beginning of every session every learner it's given me say like a red sticky and a green sticky and you might put those on your desk and if you run into a problem you would put the red sticky up on your laptop and that would signal it would help her just swoop down and answer a question or if I'm teaching about git and I see a bunch of red sticky throw-up that tells me I need to slow down and go back and stuff because I've just lost most of the classroom or if I have people work on an activity where they're coding on their own laptops I'll say put up a green sticky when you're completed with the activity so then as an instructor I can look across the room and if I see all green stickies we're good to go under the next thing we see red stickies that we've got problems the other thing that we use with the sticky notes then is a tool for a so these workshops are two days long and they're broken into a morning and afternoon session at the end of each session and the learners will write down on the green stickies something that went well and on the red sticky is something that they struggled and then during the break the instructors will compile all the sticky notes it will very quickly out feedback on how they like whether or not there was content that was over their head well though they went too fast or they went too slow and and it again it gives a very quick assessment to the instructors of how they taught and so that they can then iterate and improve their teaching for the next session or they can get a sense of what this group of learners needs in subsequent sessions as we're going through the workshop I'm just curious with the green ciggies do you wait until you see everyone have agreed you know three quarters green yeah so that's the what I do is I will give people extra exercises I will give the most important exercise first and so then if I want everyone to get you that but if you're if you're over here waiting because you know what you're doing then yeah you go work on the challenge exercises and that way then we can make sure that people got that and so that's that's one strategy I think each instructor might push that differently but that isn't common conservative like who and how many people am I willing to leave behind and that's kind of where the helpers can come in handy as well that if we've got a pretty good ratio for like this rule if we had two or three helpers floating around they could swoop in and quietly talk well you know they believe we continue on so I want to circle back on the curriculum it is open source that's available for you to use integrate into your own curriculum the only constraint is you can't call it a carpentry use there yeah thanks Chris so the the curriculum is like it says all on get up and it's available on the CC UI license so you if you're teaching a class or you're if you're teaching your own thing you could you could say I really like these aspects of what they're doing in teaching get our I thought incorporate that your own so what does a workshop look like so here's Marian I put the screen teaching couple years ago and it's pure led as I mentioned there are four sessions but we tend to have two up to four instructors teaching we have floating helpers so again Marian was a graduate student you can kind of see this we use blue stick easier to see so the blue stickies on people's laptops and and she's live coding explaining some of the outfit that she has here it looks like a bash lesson and so to be as getting had to be an official carpentry workshop you need to be part of the carpet Rees but even within the carpet used to be an official workshop you need to cover three things Bosch version control and program and so they're not super prescriptive on what programming or what version control and you teach version control works out to mainly be get I think I think there's also materials for like mercury or old or something like that something else I'm in then programming materials for our Python in the past there was also MATLAB it's kind of the feeling was that because MATLAB is not open source software expensive that that's less emphasis on that the the soft and then the the learners again tend to be diverse at least here at the University of Michigan I think we've had as few as maybe 10 there's many as 40 people in a room the the difference between sake a software carpentry workshop and a data carpentry workshop is that doctoral carpentry has these four blocks programming tents of Bosch gets one block version-control gets another block and then programming might have two blocks right so we might start the workshop with Bosch and then we might do an afternoon of R or Python and then a morning of our Python the second day the afternoon might be version-control or we might move those around one of the challenges we face is that people you know when you're looking at the ad they see version control why do I need version control it's version well it's kind of the most obscure thing but most people and so my strategy is to kind of vary version control in the curriculum so that people have to come for that right so we might do version control the morning of the second day and then our on the afternoon so that regardless people are here because they want to learn this stuff so hopefully they'll come so the software carpentry that the four modules tend to be fairly independent the examples are different across the four modules whereas data carpentry really tries to build a narrative across across the 2-day workshop the data carpentry is the software carpentry is designed to be more about software programming but what they found was that most people weren't ready for that type of workshop people to know about version right so they needed to teach that um and so data carpentry fraps goes back a step and talks a lot more about reproducible research they'll talk about good data hygiene so if you have Excel spreadsheets how do you make a good Excel switch it's like don't use colored in to indicate the variable value in your Excel spreadsheets dark a one simple things like that that you kind of have to be told to follow so data carpentry starts perhaps a little bit more of a basic level but also is kind of integrated and continuous and a narrative across the two days and there there's a lot more of aligning with different areas so there's like an ecology day of preparatory there's a genetics one I think there's a social science data partnership where they're picking examples from those fields that they would work with over the course of the two day workshop as on the on the website if you go to the carpentry org the core lessons are here there's another set of kind of think of those like satellite lessons there are all few lessons that have been translated Spanish so you'll see things like UNIX shell vertical with get programming a Python body with Python programming with our our crucible of scientific analysis and so there's a couple options for Python a couple different options for our debt and units here are links to go to the actual teaching materials as we're teaching a workshop when we set up our workshop site we have links to say the UNIX shell version if you look get and maybe RF or even as well an office if you want to then work on making modifications to those materials there's links of sites to the repositories and github there's a references instructor guide and then there are multiple maintainer z' for each repository and so if i wanted to make a change to say the programming with our repo then daniel catch an idea might accept my pull request and these are people like me across the world who are maintaining these these materials or for the organization and so this is an example of one of the our instructional materials for our novice inflammation this is the issue tracker where you can see there's 21 issues right now they try to do a good job of perhaps pointing out issues that would be good first issues or somebody that is just getting going on how to make a full request some things that perhaps require a little bit more discussion and then you know all sorts of different topics so it really is community driven if nobody answers the issues issues nope it's all there's no one you know there's it's all about the community and members of the community making changes to these materials so we're scientists we want data and thinking about how these workshops go and how effective they are there's been a lot of critiques out of the popular and tech fields of whether or not camps their workshops actually work the carpentry is in the day that they've worked with the number of academic assessment groups to quantify the outcomes of the workshop and so they're currently about sixteen hundred instructors there's been about close to thirty nine thousand learners believe this is over the last eight years the number of workshops have been offered across the organization is about seventeen hundred here at the University of Michigan were up to about about ten workshops a year that are being offered on campus and we're trying to increase that as our number of instructors grows we probably have about 15 10 to 15 active instructors on campus right now this is a gift that I got from Tracy kind of showing where all of the workshops are that have been offered really trying to have a worldwide reach and even hitting Antarctica for a workshop at one point very active groups clearly United States Australia Europe and South Africa so when we ask people to assess their confidence so when before people get to the workshop they give it an assessment to survey to answer and then after the workshop they're asked to do a follow-up assessment the purple circles are posed in the green our free workshop that in thinking about you know the conference is writing a program looking for answers with your billet II and so forth people all feel that their skills have or the perceptions of skills have improved over the course of the workshop um that when we come back and ask the people at a later date people universally say yes that they are they're more confident in doing things like writing programs and doing data analysis people again say that they agree that they learn more and out of out of 500 people very few people are feeling like they learned less or that they haven't done better their skills haven't improved long term after a workshop if they're finding that these skills are improving their efficiency ability analyze data manage data and much fewer people are not using the tools or not being helped by the tools that they learn in a workshop people also recommend these workshops to others that about 80% of participants go on to recommend up taking a workshop other people that they know that's a great testimonial if somebody's taking the workshop and then tells their fans hey you should go take this as well um these workshops off-off also offer again that's like you have a safe space for continued learning that you're a group of 20 people taking a workshop all you now have 20 other faces on your campus that you can work with as you continue to learn so people will subscribe to the software carpentry newsletter they volunteer to become a helper at a workshop or to become an instructor contribute to lessons participate in community calls so the carpenters will hold these community calls several times a month to talk about different changes or ideas people have for what to do with the curricula or different activities that we should be engaged and people have gotten involved in the governance by joining committees as well and so people continue to learn by using some of the self-guided carpentry materials but I have learned make by following the make materials through software carpentry even though make isn't something that's part of the core curriculum um we also don't have the ability to go all the way through teaching people how to make a pull request right so we can get you to the point of maybe making a push to your own repository on github but there's more materials in in the materials that you could then go back and learn how to make a full request or deal with merge conflicts or things like that and so people continue to participate in other courses engage in meetups things like an art user who I found user group in their local area and so the thing that impresses me most about the carpentry is that really does create what they call these these communities of practice where you have a roomful of people that have all gone through this workshop together and you then become that community of practice where you know perhaps your skills are all at a similar level or some are head or some kind but as a community you work together to all to improve as a group and these the goal is that they're inclusive and accessible that there's opportunities to fail a while learning it's a safe space it's not sad overflow where you're gonna get ripped apart pressing it look a question or dumb question really engages in lifelong learning engaging and local in-person communities as well as virtual networks and then collaboration within the medical school a group of postdocs created a group called the data analysis Network group which is kind of a spin-off of our supper or carpentry school bucket and again the idea being that we have these smaller communities that people can continue to return to to help to strengthen their skills over a long period of time because we can't teach people everything they need to know into this as an organization um the the Carpenters level really tried to reach a broad and diverse community 60% of the participants are white about 30% are Asian and going down of course we always want to improve our outreach to underrepresented groups we tend to have more women participating the nails and so again this is something that is I think striking in the tech world blend in most tech organizations are dominated by that and so again giving it to help women and others learn the program will hopefully help us overcome these barriers in terms of underrepresented groups technology and coding so Tracy teal who's the executive director of the carpet reason who I who gave me many of the slides in this talk as this is thinking the saying that I think is really wonderful if you want to go fast go alone do you want to go far go together and that sure it's a lot easier to perhaps get all the books you can and and figure out how to use that overflow and use these different websites and you'll maybe go fast but you're you're maybe not going to go as far as you could if you had a community behind and that's this is really emblematic of what the carpentry is trying to be so at the University of Michigan we've been active for about four years now my understanding is up before 2015 there's these sporadic workshops that we might hear about across campus in 2015 and January before January 2015 Maggie Goffe who's an ecology and evolutionary biology and myself started talking with Greg Wilson who at the time I start talking with Greg Wilson who was the founder of software carpentry because we had heard about software carpentry workshops that were being offered for women in science and we're pretty struck by that idea and we brought in four outside instructors who are women and people that I've now watched over the last four years really become leaders in the data science field people like I'm gonna forget names but Cara Wu Christie bhai saris up and basing on the name of the Forth Worth woman um but they taught parallel workshops so it's total of 70 women and we offered it in NCRC and it filled in hours right so we ought we open it up three hours later it was full we have the waiting's it was pretty remarkable so based on that success we've done that that June became a parent a partner organization with the carpet trees which means that we pay an annual subscription were then able to organize our own workshops and then the carpentry degree is to train about a dozen instructors a year and and they've been able to offer workshops like I said we're probably up to about and the twelve workshops a year that we're now offering we keep growing in few years ago we started having what we call these branded workshops that we try to hold almost every other month that having more of a general audience and so these might be offered through the library with Scott's help to get rooms in the library is that we try to take people from all areas of campus to try to do about two wise workshops here and then we try to do about three workshops a year that are targeted to the med school and then he also tried to target workshops to other groups on campus and I don't have hard numbers but I think we reach about 400 learners a year and so that's I think really remarkable and then each year we're training about 10 instructors so we have capacity of training more instructors and if we could train more instructors and have more active instructors we could clearly teach each more workshops when we offer a workshop they fill how do you get the word out how do you guys advertise for these workshops yeah so it they pretty much advertise themselves and so if you haven't heard about it so it's not because we're not advertising well because because they're filling up in hours but we have have mailing lists that of people that have expressed interest in the past in the carpet trees we have departmental mailing lists that we're all part of but and we'll try to be strategic and who we advertise to so so something like a med school so though the med school gives us funds to support us and so we have med scale med school mailing list or listener and rich for the med school so we kind of target that community if we want to enrich for people from ecology well maybe send an ad to the ecology mailing list the day or day before we teach everything else with feeders box of the wise workshops wise in advance out of the mailing list they go to so it's good to these mailing lists and and and if it's like something that's more directed or targeted to other groups around campus then kind of rely on those organizers to get the word out so so Chris helped with the workshop we offered last month to the items group through ecology I'm through epidemiology I'm sorry and I think they did all the advocates and so so like that's great that we don't have to do that but as we start thinking about getting a broader reach I think advertising is something we'll certainly want to think about more so a call to action like this is interesting to you would really encourage you to come to a workshop where I think we might have one more workshop in the works for the end of the semester but of course if people would like a workshop we can find a way to teaches workshops I think we'll also have a workshop offered in July and build the summer we're always looking for volunteers so consider becoming a helper or instructor to become an instructor we ask that you've done something with the carpenters already whether it's taking a workshop for being a helper we're always looking for people to help us logistics so Scott for just took off their library liaison and he does a great job of setting up the web sites for all the workshops right so being part of the carpentry doesn't mean being in front of the room teaching it can also be helping with logistics because I think about financial support I don't know if anyone has deep pockets here to help maybe you could talk to Brian for us but we currently get financial support from the library system from advanced and wise medical school I haven't this endowed chair that you heard about and it's kind of instead of supporting my own research group I you use that money to support things like the carpet and I'm happy to continue doing that but at the same time it really would like for this to become sustainable and even grow we also offer one-off workshops where we ask for a contribution from the people that have asked us to do the workshop again keep the organization sustainable our plans for the future we want to keep teaching these workshops and teach more of them we'd also like to perhaps do more focus workshops but one of the things we learned I think from the recent workshop that we did is that it was there's a python-based workshop and most of our instructors know art so we've been teaching a lot of our base workshops and so people want to learn some Python so they don't want to take another two-day workshop they won't maybe come in for an afternoon and epsilon Python for people that kind of know art or maybe people want to learn make or snake nick or whatever right we'd also like to begin to think about hosting an annual invited lecture so a couple years ago we had Greg Wilson come give a talk imagine bringing in a Jenny Brian or maybe we could get Hadley with them to come or you know somebody else in the data science field that could talk to people on campus from an experience with with the carpentry we'd like to become financially sustainable without me without my dau chair we'd also like to get more administrative support we don't we haven't done a great job of keeping track of numbers mainly because we don't have somebody to keep track at home if you look at our website it's got a lot of lorem it's some stuff in there that I roughed in but I just haven't had time to finish it right so I'm there are these opportunities for volunteering that would be really helpful we're also not quite at our full capacity for training people that we could get up to a dozen or so people and be more than prison our work I think we're known for teaching workshops that's what the carpet trees does but we really want to push this idea of these communities of practice where we really do more than just teach a workshop we're setting up office hours we're setting up these focus workshops or side workshops things like that so you know perhaps taking a workshop is the your entry into data analysis and then we want to be there to kind of help people continue on so going back to this question of how do we scale the number of people who can work with data this gets to the secret of the carpentry that was kind of like an aha moment for me when I learned it from Greg Wilson it's not really about the learners so we teach 400 people a year and that's a good thing but that's really not what it's all about what it's really about is building the community and and getting our learners to become instructors right so me as a professor wouldn't ever have to teach a workshop I might teach it because I like it because I think it's fun but that we are empowering our grad students and postdocs do to become those instructors to get those meaningful teaching opportunities and then the grand scheme is that many some of them then will go off to tenure track jobs and they'll take the carpentry with them and so there are people that have done this you could imagine that if you're become Kelly so Kelly's interest in becoming a trainer this year or an instructor this year so she becomes an instructor she starts teaching give and says what I want to go to a tenure-track position and she shows up that perhaps of primarily undergraduate institutions is all you know and they say well what can you teach and she could say well when I show up I'm ready to teach I think I could teach a semester long version of data analysis skills that would be stretched out version of software carpentry and therefore people that have done this and that perhaps along the way is again because the curriculum is open sourced and because we're not really regimented in what you how you teach and what exactly you teach what examples you do perhaps over the years she's taught she's then incorporated other ideas and other I bet she's bringing in to make it her own and she can show that institution that I can teach I've got experience I've I've been trained in these pedagogy's and actually deployed them out into the real world and I've done that rather than make sure a bunch of undergrads don't burn down the chemistry and so if you'd like to learn more I'm on campus I'm always happy to talk we have the carbon trees org website is where you can find the online tutorials and learn more about the organization this is our website that is a very much of a work in progress email address we have two M community groups so one is SW carpentry and one is SW carpentry updates that you're welcome to join updates will update you about upcoming workshops on STV carpentry is for anybody but it tends to be people that are any trained instructors and sends out agendas for a monthly meetings that we hold over in hatchery library and we'd always love to have more people involved and people at least even just come check us out I think our next workshop will be in April and then the one after that and that's still getting organized and then there'll be one in July you're looking for workshop and then we start up again before the semester starts in the fall without happy to take any questions people I have in the interdisciplinary field Maddox has and you said already talking about this we've already seen this very preparing but there has to be some form of knowledge before somebody can be a doctor for software carpentry insider knowledge so to speak but is there anything to be said about at least at your level because a little higher higher level than me it's a steep the these departments supporting kind of going to you know these interdisciplinary fields because you come to a bioinformatics course and there's there's no educational material on how to teach bioinformatics and that is a specific skill set that is not true yeah and I think that's a big challenge and so my I've always always been to kind of try to lead by example and so I mean I have no one sent ups to teach the med school but I do this because I think it's important in it it's going to help me attract good students and postdocs and get them up to speed faster somebody over in Public Health was telling me about how they're moving they moved from SAS to arc and the first semester of main the first class they take that is using our they were given all this cookie cutter code and they've told the copy and paste into the arc and so then I get to the second semester and the instructor expects that they know are because they've got all the way through they don't right so there's still a lot of work to do but we are trying to integrate with but we're trying to great with them to say hey let's let's have a workshop so people at least have an idea of what's going on with our EB College evolutionary biology I think has a boot camp for kind of incoming grad students and we've gotten in somewhat involved with them perhaps on teaching like an official software crafter workshop by trying to tomorrow so we're trying to kind of reach our tentacles into these different areas but it's slow yeah yeah and it was fantastic one of the things I think is thank you about their instructor training is that it's not trying to teach Python it's not trying to teach you version control it's trying to teach you pedagogy so that you can really try to get in the mindset of a learner and I really need age them to create that safe community of learning so it's a really super focus the other thing also is that you mentioned this badly the people in the front of the room they're not necessarily the expert proficient masters of their domain their peers so it's really expected I guess really more of the rules the exception is that you're pretty much one step ahead of the sheriff like so the learners might ask a question and you'd be like I'm not really sure I'll I'll check that out or there's an advanced question so the expectation is not you can answer every question and if you the master of Python it's that you're creating a safe space and effective learning space guess I guess what I was trying to go off of was turning the dialogue about software carpentry is great for the carpentry Zuri and I've already I've started my own group that was had this same concept in mind and everybody just told me we're not Chapra carpentier something like I understand the importance of it I understand the benefit that's brought to this campus the dialog I was trying to say is why isn't it like this is extracurricular why isn't the campus have something that's saying this is how pedagogy should be approached in the department because how long is instructor training if you think that that's sufficient to make you good in stuff yeah it's everything so the I understand your point and I think that that's a big problem in there are certainly group to think on campus like the academic innovations and others that are trying to do things to improve instruction on campus and we're just a bit of that and I think if we I stuck my neck out a little bit further and you know I could get people's attention but two things I'll say is about like the instructor training with Chris mention it's two days it's not long but there's a ton of content in it and it's active so you I remember when I went through I had to teach a beginner what a dataframe was right five minutes to teach you updated without using jargon but not you it's like a simple but we're really important concept in our or in Python right and so you know do these little activities you learn a lot and you know we might last year we may have had a dozen people go through the instructor training but that doesn't make you an instructor like you also have to answer one of these issues and file a pull request and you have to engage in a discussion and there's lots of things that come up that you might not get all the way through and part of me is like I paid for that person but at the same time like they're out there now and they've taken the instructor training and maybe then I've got teach for me but hopefully they're gonna be somewhere where they teach and they make the place better so you know yeah I'd be awesome if we got like more faculty to maybe take the training but to Chris's point also about not quite being one step ahead with this gentleman right here you kind of see his little clothes who's now a postdoc in my lab and he was at a grad student Wayne State when this picture was taken and he became an instructor with him like a year and a half taking this workshop right so you went from like minimal to no skills do becoming an instructor working a lab with a lotta bioinformatics writing his own article a cage-like and that's that's fairly common kind of good question yeah you were talking about the financial aspects involved what are we talking about because I mean we can work within the structure the university get want to build something it's a fourth right you yeah yeah and it's like um don't get me wrong I like doing it but like something for the basic subscription it's fifteen thousand a year which is like not a lot of money I mean it's funny but it's not that much what you consider going around and maybe third half of that we cover with money from advance and the libraries and the med school but it would be nice to house a like have an administrative assistant that kind of helps with logistics that we can pay the new things or to to grow clarify so we wanted to organize workshop how much would they pay and how much lead learners yeah so if so our branded workshops are free to everybody and the deal that we work with likewise at the med school is it's basically a thousand dollars per workshop and so when we work with the libraries we consider the kind of library supporting the branded workshops they don't want any money they don't want to charge the learners anything one of the things we debate a lot whether or not to charge people a five months because we get people that don't show up that first good but yeah so if somebody you know DC MB he wanted a workshop we ask for a thousand dollars and then you get your workshop and that goes to again helping to train people like Mary Ann Kelly or whoever to become instructors thank you yeah the other questions well thank you I know this is maybe a little bit different from girls normal tech context tech thing but I'm happy to talk to you about it and as always if you have questions feel free to get in touch Thanks [Applause]
