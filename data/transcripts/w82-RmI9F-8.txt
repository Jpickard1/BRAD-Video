okay so as Melanie said I will provide a brief overview about the biology and biology of sauce Kobe - or I can advance this right the which is short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - and I will in today's talk just call it sauce - and as you probably aware it's the causative agent of covert 19 the disease which is a similar concept that we are already familiar with the with HIV or human immunodeficiency virus causing the AIDS disease and as of this morning there were over three million confirmed cases of sauce - in the world with over a million so a third of those cases in the United States and so coronaviruses get their name from the appearance on electron micrographs and so if you look in the right top corner here you can see an electron micrograph of these virus particles and surrounding these particles is the corona or the crown and this crown is driven by the spiked protein so if you go to the bottom you can see a cartoon of these virus particles and in pink is the spike protein or the S which is embedded into the envelope and this so these are enveloped viruses that are roughly 120 nanometers in diameter and in addition to the spiked protein that protrudes from this envelope there are also other structural proteins the membrane or M protein and E or envelope protein that are embedded within this envelope the fourth structural protein is in or nucleic acid and that surrounds the viral genome which is if positive-sense single-stranded and it's a roughly thirty kilobases in in length and coronaviruses in general they are spread by the respiratory and or fecal all routes and the these viruses are divided into into four different general that you can see here alpha beta gamma and delta coronaviruses and i have listed all of the human coronaviruses here in those are found in alpha and beta coronaviruses and the top four here are the common cold corona viruses and then the emerging corona viruses sauce one two and most are found in beta corona virus genus and what we know about their ancestry is that gamma and delta corona viruses have a avian ancestor while the alpha and beta corona viruses that emerged from a bat ancestor and so to look at the genomic organization of sauce to you can see in this cartoon here that the virus expresses a great number of proteins up to 28 proteins and the non structural approach genes are expressed from the five comment of the genome now these are the proteins that encode the replicase enzyme so the RNA dependent on a polymerase that replicates the genome and other accessory proteins as well as the proteases which can clip the poly protein into its individual pieces the three prime end of the genome encodes the structural proteins the four structural proteins that I've mentioned earlier and up to eight accessory proteins which modulate the innate immune response and the host and if you're interested to learn more about how these various proteins and mRNAs encoding them get expressed there's a one-hour youtube video from another from Britt glancing all that goes into more detail before those interested now for today's talk what I would like to do is focus on the steps in the viral life cycle and the reason being is that that each aspect of the virus life cycle represents an opportunity to disrupt the infection and thus is a target for antiviral drug development and so we'll talk about virus entry virus replication and then assembly and release as we go through the slides and so let's first focus on corona virus entry so where as with every virus the virus engages in with a host receptor and then has to cross the limiting membrane of the cell and to deliver its genome into the cytoplasm and so far a virus is what we know is that there are four different receptors so the sauce one and two as well as NL 63 use ace to the anger tenzin converting enzyme two and nos uses the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 to to 9e uses amino peptidase and and then OC 43 and HK HK you wanna use a modified si Alec acid to bind to the cell surface and the protein that mediates this is the spike protein and you can see a cartoon here of the domain structure of the spike protein with the N one domain the n-terminal domain being responsible for attachment so there's it encodes the receptor binding that domain while the s two domain is has the transmembrane domain that ankles the spike in the viral envelope and it contains the proteolytic cleavage sites which are required for fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and in a recent study that was just published in cell huffman and all they demonstrated that the ace 2 is the receptor 4 sauce - and you can see the data on the right side here and what these authors did is that they used the pseudo very on assay and so instead of using the entire sauce - virus what they did is they took a vsv a vesicular stomatitis virus and then just replace the G glycoprotein with the spike proteins of these four corona viruses and then they ask whether phk two cells that express these different coronavirus receptors would be able to mediate entry of these pseudo variants and what you can see is that both sauce 1 & 2 were able to use human and bat ace 2 but not the other 2 receptors while as expected 2 2 9 e used APN and Millis use the DPP for receptor and further confirming that a stew is involved when you then use antibodies against H 2 you can prevent infection of the pseudo variants either from sauce 1 or 2 when you use increasing concentrations of these antibodies and of course receptor expression is often linked to tropism which means you know which cell types are being infected by a given virus and that was also investigated in this recent cell paper and so what you can see is vsvg pseudo variants at the top compared to sauce one in the middle and sauce 2 on the bottom and what the authors did is they basically just asked which different cell lines could support pseudo virion entry and you can see listed at the bottom here are several different human respiratory cell lines then a kidney cell line and liver cell line and in the colon intestinal cell line and so except for this one human respiratory cell and all of the human cell lines were able to support virus entry in addition to the vero cells which were monkey cells while mammals or bat cell lines that were less related to humans did not significantly support entry and this actually lines out well with what we know about a Stu expression so this is just data from the human protein Atlas where you can see that h2 protein expression is very high in the gastrointestinal tract and also found in the liver and the kidney as well as some other tissues and so however just binding to the receptor is not sufficient for the virus to enter the cells and at the top here there is a this is a diagram of what coronavirus entry steps look like and so once the receptor is bound by this the spike protein in this case it's the tribal and it's the s-1 domain that binds to it there needs to be a proteolytic cleavage event that across so that the s-1 trimer is displaced and the fusion peptides are released so that they can do their function and it's shown much better in the lower diagram where you can see these orange rectangles which represents the fusion peptides and so once that cleavage event occurs these fusion peptides now are free to insert into the host cell membrane and these trials then undergo conformational changes they basically fold up on top of each other and it's that that pulls the both the host cell membrane and the viral membrane close together so that they can fuse and so based on what we knew from sauce one the same authors from the cell paper also looked at what are the proteases for sauce two that mediate this proteolytic activation of and they tested two different proteases TM p RS s - which is a transmembrane protein searing - that is inhibited by chemists at and then cathepsins which are inhibited by e64 d and so you can see that data here so V results Express a stew but then they do not express TMP RSS - and so in the cells when only cathepsins are active if you inhibit this cathepsins with a 60-40 you can see that sauce 1 or sauce to entry is bringing inhibited while the TMP RSS to inhibit or did not have any effect however when TMP RSS - now is expressed in the same the same cells you can see that the cassava cathepsins are much less important and that TMP RSS to is the preferred protease however in combination both the inhibiting cathepsins and T and P RSS to are the most effective in preventing virus entry okay so just to recap entry of the virus requires binding of s to its receptor and then a proteolytic cleavage event that then allows for fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane to release the genome into the cytosol and then once the RNA is delivered into the cytosol replication starts to happen and the very first step for positive sense RNA viruses is always translation because they're viral on a dependent on a polymerase needs to be expressed first so in this case off 1 a and 1 a B are being translated proto lyrically processed and then the individual non structural proteins then assembled to form this replicates complex and we'll look at that more specifically in the next slide but what the replicase does is it makes more on a genomes and so if you focus on the right side you can see that RNA replication happens in membranous vesicles and we'll I'll show a few images of that in a bit but within those vesicles the positive sense on a genome is the template for the replicates to make a negative sense genome this then results in this double stranded on a replicative intermediate and then the negative sense genome again is the template for more positive sense genomes which can be then packaged to make new variants so the replicas obviously is a very important protein and is actually even among the RNA viruses a very special protein in case of the corona viruses and the reason is that typically on a dependent on a polymerase Asst have low fidelity so that means they make lots of mistakes and that limits the size of Ani viruses to below 15 kilobases however I told you that corona viruses have genomes that are around 30 kilobases in size and so the only reason that these viruses can maintain viral fitness is that they have a replicase of higher fidelity so one that makes fewer mistakes and this is mediated by the exonuclease activity of NSP 14 and so NSP 14 teams up with the on a dependent on a polymerase is so if it makes mistakes those can be corrected and shown on the bottom here is this nice cartoon of what the replicates complex looks like and it includes several of the other non structural proteins which actually form a complex that has similarities with a DNA dependent polymerase as' and with a for example NSP 9 as a single strand that nuclear nucleic acid binding protein and then NSP 7 and 8 might form something that looks like a sliding clam but to show you how important this exonuclease activity is i want to just show this one piece of data from mock Tennyson's lab where they took in this case saws one wild-type and compared it to a mutant that had the mutated Xon activity and what you can see what they did is they infected cells waited for one replicative cycle and then sequenced all of the and then the mutations were aligned along the viral genome on the x-axis and the frequency of the mutation in the population on the y-axis what you can see just focusing on the black boss the wild-type sauce makes few mistakes but the xon mutant virus makes many mistakes in many different parts of the genome and as you might imagine viruses that have many mutations are very attenuated in vitro as well as in vivo and so X targeting xon activity is one of the antiviral strategies that is being employed to develop antivirals okay and so just to show you these replication complexes which are so important for the virus we can see images here from sauce one and in general all positive sense on a viruses hijack intracellular membranes during replication and you can you can see here what an infected cell cytoplasm looks like on the bottom here there's the nucleus and as the might is one mitochondria and then lots of these membrane blobs and when those are reconstructed in 3d you can see these double membrane vesicles that are being made by the virus and it's within these vesicles that the double-stranded RNA is found and that's when new genomes of being replicated and one thought is why these viruses need to rearrange membranes so dramatically is that it helps them concentrate the enzymes and substrates in defined location but also it hides away the double-stranded RNA which I'm sure you're aware of is a very strong molecular pattern that is recognized by cells as a dangerous signal and so these membranes are thought to help hide those patterns and on the right you can just see the as a time series as time progresses there are more and more membrane rearrangement starting with rough ER and convoluted membranes double strand these double membrane vesicles all the way to assembly and so that brings us to the last step in the life cycle which is assembly and release and so once the proteins have been translated the structural proteins s m and e are inserted into the ER membrane and it is from there that they then move into the golgi and it's in the intermediate golgi compartment that M is the catalyst for the assembly so M will recruit both s and E and then also n which brings the genome along and then the virus pods into the golgi compartment to form the mature variants that can then be released by exocytosis and one aspect of this is that not all of the s protein is being recruited into these new variants and so when free s protein reaches the cell surface and it's cleave by host protease is it can mediate fusion and so you can have what's called the sensation and this is an image ramen sauce - infected macaque and so infected cells that are expressing s on this and the cell membrane can then fuse with uninfected cells to make these multinucleated structures and this also helps the virus hide from antibody neutralization because now it can infect a new cell without even leaving the protection of the cell membrane and so after having talked about the structural proteins as well as the non structural proteins that make the replicate complex I just want to end by briefly talking about the accessory proteins and this is a summary of a few of them and their function in sauce one and as you can see here they are involved in modulating the immune responses whether it's up regulating cytokines and chemokines or suppressing the induction of type 1 interference and interference signaling and this was highlighted in a study in 2016 how important the type 1 interferon response was for disease symptoms development and so this was Stan Pullman's lab that infected mice with sauce 1 and they could show that depending on the timing of the type 1 interferon response and the magnitude of it that then in affected the magnitude of of the disease as well if the type 1 interferon response was happened earlier or was reduced in magnitude they also saw disease and so that brings me to the end of this brief excursion into the corona virus life cycle and before I turn things over to Dan I just want to thank the people in my lab done an awesome group and I look forward to the day that we can all assemble again so this was our last lab picture before quarantine and so hopefully we can we can resume those [Applause]
