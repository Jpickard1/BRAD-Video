thank you for come to us oh yeah thank you very much alright everybody hear me yeah okay yeah my got a sore throat here so we're gonna be a little soft hmm just let me know if I'm not speaking loud enough you can seriously hear this okay okay don't sound like I'm talking very loud thank you very much for that nice introduction and thanks to CC and B for inviting me and for funding clay and I the money is supporting this kind of research and so this is like a progress report on how the project is going so I'll talk about functional connect omics and biomarkers in psychiatry and I don't know what your format is but I think I have like an hour or something like that and rather than do like questions at the end if you'll ask questions while this is going on I think that'll be better so that kind of flow man just raise your hand wherever so biomarkers what are they the theme here is that psychiatry there's a worry that it's kind of a squishy field and you know we do interview individuals and we don't have objective criterion and so biomarkers are the idea that we need some sort of quantitative indicator of the disease process or pathogenic States pharmacological response and there's much much interest in psychiatry provide for identifying biomarkers it's essentially like the buzzword to get grant funding in psychiatry you stick biomarkers in the title of the grant and the specific aims in the methods and the resources in in the conclusions and you'll get funded so here's a kind of flow process of in schematic form of how individuals come into psychiatric care so this individual feels sad goes to their psychiatrist I don't know if people are familiar with the DSM for manuals they're the Bible for identifying psychiatric diagnoses the psychiatrist based interview makes a decision well does this person have depression do they have bipolar depression it's very very hard to tell from the interview whether it's bipolar depression which is a specific type of depression with very different prognostic significance and treatment implications so if we had quantitative markers that to replace things like a clinical interview then we would be able to sort people in diagnostic categories and the implications you know if I decide that the person has depression do I send them to the therapist do I give them medicines which medicine do I give them we also want biomarkers for treatment response we want to know should they get this treatment or that treatment if they get that treatment what are the prognosis hopefully a biomarker could help to identify that beyond that there's biomarkers of disease of vulnerability so this person back when they were smaller younger and slightly different shade of yellow they they don't have the sad face that they have here but they may have as a latent quality some sort of depressive quality and that might be objective objectively discernible via biomarkers imaging has long been thought that it might be maybe it's thought that we could furnish biomarker for psychiatry in the classic way that this is done is you take healthy individuals people with different disease categories like bipolar and major depression you put them in the scanner and you have them do a task and this task is look at neutral faces versus harsh faces mm-hmm excuse me and then here's the the famous amygdala and you can see that in bipolar depression it was lighting up where as a major depression it was not and in control individuals it was not at one time I think it was thought that these kinds of tasks and looking at individual discrete brain regions we would find the biomarkers we need in psychiatry but the fact is that even when we find statistically significant differences in an individual brain region the amount of discriminative information we're getting is not that substantial and the effectiveness of these kinds of things for classification is not that good so we need to find more sources of information from function Imaging and what I'll be talking about today is a method to get more information from fMRI scans and this is Kinect omics so what is Kinect omics well everybody's putting omec after different kinds of things so one justification for connectomics is we want to join that kind of bandwagon but there's actually a good scientific rationale here some people here may be familiar with C elegans the the worm and it only has like 500 neurons in every single axonal connection between neurons has been mapped and has been known for a long time that's structural connectivity that's the pattern of wiring in the brain that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about functional connectivity today functional connectivity refers to the way the brain regions quote-unquote talk to each other it's a kind of a broad term we use for functional activity that's coherent between different brain regions as measured by functional scanning as opposed to structural scanning the other thing that I'll often talk about is intrinsic functional connectivity the for now what that means is the kinds of connectivity signals we're observing are not driven by tasks not by presenting harsh faces versus neutral faces there's something that the brain spontaneously does irrespective of tasks so let me explain this idea of intrinsic functional connectivity more people are very familiar with this idea in the scanner we've give people pictures of harsh faces and then alternatively we give them pictures of just a cross on the screen to observe and we measure the bold signal the bold signal is the signal that's being emitted another way to put it is is the signal that's detectable by standard fMRI scanning and what the volt signal is doing is during the neutral condition or the cross condition it's staying quiet in this particular voxel of the brain it's elevated when you show faces and it goes quiet again when you're just showing across that's the activation perspective where you're driving the bold signal based on the stimuli you're presenting the connectivity perspective is different um the connectivity perspective for at least the first few analyses I'll be talking about we're not showing people any stimuli at all they're just in the scanner and they're looking at a cross and you might think well if they're just not doing anything the bold signal is just going to be quiet like that well that of course doesn't happen because you'd be dead if the bold signal is just not doing anything like that here's what's really happening the bold signal is oscillating its exhibiting spontaneous fluctuations at about 0.01 to 0.1 Hertz that phenomenon has long been known that the bold signal is oscillating like that that's been known for about 15 or 20 years what people have discovered maybe this was known in the late 90s but people didn't put it all together until about 10 years later that the following the bold signal is correlated in different regions of the brain so here's the example of two uncorrelated regions I put a seed right there and extract the bold signal I put a seed right there and extract the bold signal and I look at their pattern of spontaneous oscillations over time these two regions are not correlated these two regions I'm showing with a circle they are correlated why would they be correlated the answer to that is well for one thing when that's the terminology here when two regions exhibit coherent activity like that we say they're functionally connected what is the significance of functional connectivity it's the following and this you know this paper the first paper about this came out in 1995 but again the significance of this was not recognized until much later here's left motor cortex and here's right motor cortex if I put a seed in left and a seed and right and extract their bold activity over time they're highly correlated one thing we already know is that motor cortex on left and on the right form a functional unit they're architectural and structurally tightly connected and the kind of information they processing they do is they trade information with each other at a high rate here's left motor cortex and here's left visual cortex we already know architecture early and information processing lives they don't talk to each other and their spontaneous bolt signals are not correlated so that's the key idea here that is that intrinsic functional connectivity this easily measured bold signal and that pattern of spontaneous bold oscillation is an indicator of network structure of the brain both architectural and information processing links in the brain any questions about that yeah questions all right yeah yeah that's a great question so one of the first networks to be this discovered by means of this pattern of coherent intrinsic functional connectivity was the default mode but there are many many other networks than the default mode so if they're not equivalent in the sense that intrinsic functional connectivity is a method of uncovering networks and one such network is the default mode and it's good to clear up one other misconception because I think this is one of the most common misconceptions intrinsic functional connectivity doesn't exist only at rest its task irrespective connectivity which means it happens at rest and it also happens during tasks it's really important to emphasize because one of the most common questions I get from ants member is oh you're studying connectivity during tasks that kind of connectivity is only present during rest no no no its present during both rest an tasks its task irrespective connectivity that's it what made spontaneously oscillations means yeah the idea is that you could put a small seed pretty much anywhere in that in that region that's right so the spatial boundaries of the regions that are exhibiting coherent activity are wider than just a small seed it would be entire regions of the brain yeah and we'll actually see that in more detail coming up and the slide after this this phenomenon of this kind of coherence spontaneous oscillations exhibiting coherence it was known in 1995 the default mode paper came out in 2001 much more interest came out in about 2005 and these days there's literally thousands of papers on this topic and it's coming out all the time this has become kind of a big area of research um I'm gonna focus there's many different ways to quantum to come up with a number of how many networks there are but broadly speaking many people would settle on about seven major networks and this is a recent paper by Yellen colleagues and they show the seven network parcel ation again what this means is that here's default mode in this red it's as if the default mode is singing a song but singing row row row your boat every region in the default mode is singing that song every region in some at a motor network over here is singing a different song it's slightly more complicated than that it's not simply that these networks are coherent within network and not coherent outside but there's patterns between networks so that this network default mode maybe have a anti correlation with some other network and the bottom line is that in psychiatry we believe that a lot of psychiatric disorders manifest by perturbed connections within major networks as well as alterations in connections between major networks so this theme of there being networks in the brain that are exhibiting coherent activity within a network and exhibiting interesting relationships with other networks that's going to keep coming up again and again which is why I'm making a big deal about it right now any questions about that okay yeah I mean it depends on how much how what you mean by how well there are maps of the brain that you can get from DTI of light magnet white matter tracks odd Rafi and there's definitely links between functional connections instructional connections as revealed by DTI there's tracer methods in monkeys and you can find and there is ways of showing that functional connectivity lines up with architectural lengths that we can get from the animal studies so it's not perfect but there is similarity yeah right that's subcortical regions and it's blacked out for the purposes of this parcel ation basically we treat gray matter Nyoka and cortical regions excuse me we treat them in some of these network maps and we ignore the subcortical regions and it's not because they lack intrinsic kind of spontaneous oscillations they do I don't know the reason why for most kind of parse elation schemes omit the subcortical regions I don't know if anybody else knows the answer to that because they certainly exhibit spontaneous oscillations you can put seeds in them and you can find their patterns and connectivity with cortical networks all right yeah yeah effective connectivity is uh it relates in the sense in many ways you can think of the relationship between correlation causation functional connectivity pertains to relationships that are discerned by correlations between regions and affective connectivity tries to use patterns of correlations between regions to infer underlying causation using different kinds of methods so effective connectivity lines of the causality so again two regions of default Network or coherent region of the default Network and here violet is ventral tension Network they're not correlated and in fact it's likely that these two regions many people believe are going to be anti correlated with each other to a certain extent so intra network connectivity in between network connectivity traditionally connectivity has been studied with seed based methods so I put a seat over here I take out the bowl time series I see what other what other regions of the brain are correlated with that seed perhaps it's this map right here similarly for that seat over here similarly for this seat over here in yellow that method gives you windows for particular regions of the brain but you can't really get a sense of what's going on in the entire brain that way so connectomics is the method where and this is what I'll be talking about today is basically you put seeds throughout the brain you develop some scheme of parse elating the entire brain put seeds everywhere and then for each seed you can ask what is its correlation with each other seed that generates a matrix like this since this is correlation and the correlation between this 1 & 2 & 2 & 1 are the same you can kind of throw out the lower diagonal throw away the diagonal as well because that's all ones and then all the useful information about how each seed is correlated with every other seed is contained in the upper diagonal here we usually use about 1080 seeds so this is a very big object it probably has six hundred thousand elements in it if you want to think about it visually it would be at angle like this every seeds correlation with every other seeds would be a huge object like this this interchangeably that thing right here that thing right there that's a connectome and that's kind of gonna be the unit that we keep analyzing in all our studies so let's talk about some of those studies and what kind of things we can do with the Kinect oh um and so every analysis only talking about our did our work undertaken with my colleagues here all of whom are here which is why this audience seems kind of filled out many people that I brought Daniel Mike and you are in Department circuitry clay is associate professor in eeks talk as a graduate student in eeks and these guys are the brain power behind this operation so I'm gonna be pointing at them to answer your questions that I can't answer and you know all these analyses we've done very collaboratively Daniel in particular could stand up here and give this talk I'm sure actually you can do a better job than I could so this is all collaborative work this is the datasets we have a lot of them come from sharing initiatives so one of the great things about resting-state is it can be done in a standard way across different places in the United States and so people can pull the different resting-state scans they get from patient groups across different places how many talking about the ADHD 200 data set which is this name because it has about 800 scans and the autism data set which has about 1200 autism scans people familiar with our regular studies that we do we collect our own data which has you know 20 to 40 subjects in it these are big big data sets and that these are the ones that were going to be analyzing so the ADHD 200 dataset consists of these sites there's actually one more site than this but it's phenotypic data was not available this is actually the data that we analyzed so we have 462 total scans after getting rid of ones that didn't pass quality checks 263 ADHD and 700 I'm sorry 462 healthy 263 ADHD for a total of 725 that we analyzed so this is the flow of the analysis this first one is a mass univariate multi-level model so I'll show how this analysis was done this is the overall flow and the overall goal is to get a map like this on which we do statistical inference but I'll walk through the steps of how this thing works for starters we have our subjects at all the different sites so green is healthy red is ADHD each subject contributes a connectome recall that is you take their bowl time series from the resting state you calculate pair wives on Pearson's arse there's a thousand and eighty seed so you get 600,000 elements so you get all these connectomes each subject contributes one the next step is we set up this kind of multi-level model and I'll say more about how this kind of model works in a moment but it's basically a kind of regression analysis and we'll get the effect of disease out of this model the next step is based on the significance testing of the effect of disease we create a thresholded map that represents all the edges at which ADHD was greater than healthy control or significantly different than healthy control and then we do some additional statistical inference on this map so let me walk through those steps this is what the multi-level model looks like so for each feature there are 600,000 features and we're gonna do every single feature separately for each feature we set up a regression analysis where there's a data for the effective disease a beta for the effective site because these data are coming from different sites each site has a different scanner the scanner is calibrated differently as different signal-to-noise ratios and things so we need to regress out the effective scanner motion is a huge confound in imaging analyses so we have the effect of motion and it's a random intercept model so we also have an interest a mean zero intercept per site as well as a regular regression on error term and we do this separately for every single feature so we do 600,000 separate analyses this is the map that we get and we threshold the map at P less than point zero zero one and I'll say more about the structure of this map in a moment one thing to notice is that there's going to be a lot of false positives in this map why we did 600,000 tests we only threshold it at a point zero zero one so I'm gonna have to say more about why you should have any faith or credence in the results of this map second red means increased in ADHD Blue means decreased in ADHD so we're showing with color the difference between the two groups the next thing is about the structure of how this map is laid out the great Japanese computer scientist Tekken or what Hanabi discovered the use of this map so the basic idea behind this map is that the edges are now laid out in a way that makes it very clear the network affiliation of the edges so all the connections within default mode network are now easily seeing with your eyes right there all the connections between default mode network and visual network for example are easily seen because they're right there so we're taking this kind of map that par slates the brain into different kind of networked clubs and we're imposing that on this map and that's going to help us organize the information that we're getting when we calculate the differences between the two groups as a third example you know here's ventral attention Network and its connection to visual network okay so is this kind of map clear most of our data is going to be presented on maps like this and this is one thing that's been very helpful for us people are not necessarily using maps like this in the field and this has been a very helpful thing for us to get familiar with our data and see what's going on in the between group differences any questions about this okay so the next step is if we bonferroni correct the significance of every single one of these edges so every dot is an edge or a connection or a member of the connectome if we bonferroni correct which means you correct for the fact that you did 600,000 statistical tests this would be blank so we but the bonferroni correction is not the right approach here the thing that jumps out at you when you look at a map like this is that the density of the presence of these dots is not randomly distributed throughout first of all there's more dots than you would expect by chance why would you why is that because by chance alone because we threshold this map at point zero zero one one tenth of 1% of this thing should be filled because we expect one tenth of one percent false positives under the null hypothesis that there's no difference between diseased and healthy but this is more than 1/10 of 1% filled not only that when certain cells cell just means a place where two networks intersect so here's the cell that links to fall Network and eventual attention network certain cells are filled much more than you would expect by chance so that's the basis of what we're going to call a network contingency analysis what that is is for each cell we're going to calculate the number of significant edges observed compared to the one the number that you would expect by chance alone which is one-tenth of one percent and the actual test that we use is we use a binomial distribution with parameter P point zero zero one and n is this the number of edges in the cell the result of that and now shading is being used to show where there are cells with statistically significant more edges than you would expect by chance and much of this math is filled at this point so what that means is that between disease and healthy certain regions of this map in particular the ones that are shaded are highly statistically significantly different that is those cells have far more edges than you would expect by chance so even though bon for e correction applied to the individual dot it is not statistically significant when it's applied at the level of the cell there clearly are very big differences between these groups you can actually see the p values here are ranging between 10 to the negative third and ten to the negative fifteen so some of these are absurdly high P values so what is the interpretation of this here's the default mode Network there's high folk connectivity in ADHD within the default mode network here is the ventral attention network there's hyper connectivity within the ventral attention Network I'm sorry I said that incorrectly there is hyper connectivity between the default network and eventual attention network so those two networks are more correlated or another way to put it they're less segregated than it is then in healthy clothes that's an important finding because that's one of the most widely discussed and replicated findings in the field that an ADHD there is enhanced connectivity between default mode and dorsal and ventral attention networks so this map is kind of showing you things that the field already believes but showing you from a different perspective any questions about this Matt yeah yeah it's so a qualitative answer to that is the structure of resting-state networks is thought to be very reliable and robust across individuals and within the same individual across time so yeah I can't give too many quite too much more quantitative information beyond that other than it is thought to be reliable and robust yeah question yeah I should have said what that means yellow means there's one thing I didn't say and that is in these cells when blue predominates we shade the color of the entire cell we do a sign test and we shade the entire color of the cell based on what colors for dominating in terms of the edges within the cell and yellow means it's mixed so that there is by the test of are there more edges in this cell than you would expect by chance yes is the directionality of the difference predominant in terms of enhanced or decrease connectivity no it's a mixed bag that very same cell is showing a mixed picture of hyper and hypo connectivity that's what the yellow means to put a map like this in context I think that we were very very surprised to see this map and by the way we did this analysis maybe two weeks ago so it's still kind of sinking in on the meaning of this map we usually don't see highly significant results across the entire brain in our fMRI analyses usually we're trying to coax signal out of the data we certainly don't see effects at 10 to the negative 15 I've certainly never seen that now one thing is we don't work with data sets that are 1,000 subjects we work with data sets that are 40 or 50 subjects it may very well be the huge effect sizes we're seeing because we have so many subjects but it's also likely the this kind of connect Tomic map is identifying discriminative information in the data that wasn't present otherwise and one way we can kind of say that is when we do connect Helmick maps on normal sized datasets we also get pretty inflated peel-out p-values so I think that there we are getting more discriminative information how the data with this kind of analysis Daniel do you recall it's all over the place probably yeah okay yeah let me a couple of places I'm going to put questions out here I mean one of the reasons why this talk was so attractive for us to do here is because we thought through by people in the audience that would answer you know questions that we have about the data and one of them is and so you know Hamid is here Hamid is out here as graduate student we talked about hub structure hubs and other motifs that might be in the data so we're analyzing this with kind of you know univariate tests that have done separately every everything will edge but clearly this kind of data is susceptible for identifying higher-order features graph theoretic kinds of approaches yeah it just jumps out at you with your eyes that there are regions so this node right here is changing its connectivity with every single other node inside the default network here's another kind of hub area you know there's a node somewhere over here that at least in the front for our parietal and default network is changing its connectivity with a lot of other regions but the hub structure so a hub is a region that's changing its where has affiliations with a bunch of other regions the hub regions are moderated by network so it's not as if the hubs I mean maybe some of these hubs are across the entire brain but other hubs seem to be network specific so somebody needs to devise a method to look at this data and assign a p-value to the hubs and correct for multiple comparisons and so then we could you know write up and say in ADHD there was a significant difference in the hub status of that particular node right here and that's a highly statistically significant result we need to be able to say that and somebody needs to and I think you know there's clustering methods that are available however a priori parcel ation using the yo network does seem to capture structure in the data that is there's clearly a lot going on inside default Network the default network is an operator categorization that we impose on the data from the yo network but there may be better parcel ation schemes where there may be data-driven parcel ation schemes so I would say that those people in the audience that have a background and you know some of these methods you should ask yourself what would I do if I had to connect them like this what would I try to analyze it with if you have any ideas you should let us know because it seems like this is a very rich data kind of data to study so that was the multi-level model can the network contingency analysis multi-level model I now I want to show the data on autism for that we have both a multi-level model as well as some classification results so the autism data is actually even bigger and more complicated I don't know you do you remember how many subjects we included this is how many subjects are available on this site and I forget how many we actually include is like nine about a thousand okay and these are all the sites and this is all publicly available data by the way so it's the same kind of thing over here there's all the subjects across the different sides it's not just two sides I'm just showing two for ease every subject can donate to connect them to the analysis we do a a multi-level model with the effect of disease as well as a random intercept term we threshold it at point zero zero one and then we do the network contingency analysis to do statistical inference which gives us the shading here's what we see in autism once again it looks like a quilt it's you know it's kind of an abundance of differences and there is no other way to put that there is tons and tons and tons and tons of differences between autistic brains and once again the p-values are you know through the roof up to the 10 to the negative 15 there is a lot of diffuse hyper connectivity between these reasons default in frontal parietal and multiple other regions intra network connectivity is almost uniformly high Fokin ected in autism and it's just hard to summarize the quantity of these findings there's a lot of them for those of you that study autism you'll recognize that pretty much aberrations in every single network have been identified in autism separately with seed based analyses and that's kind of what we're saying here if you had done seed based analyses no matter where you put your seed you're gonna find network abnormalities except we're showing this connect on the clean air for comparison here's ADHD in autism side by side and back to back ADHD has a lot more hub structure in the default network that's one big difference in fact the  the hypo connectivity is far more diffuse and heavy in ADHD than autism one big difference is in sense Matta motor Network which is clearly hypo connected and has hub structure in autism and is hyper connected and lacks hub structure in ADHD so one thing is clear there's different kinds of network abnormalities in autism and ADHD it's not the very same thing going on in the two disorders we've also done schizophrenia by the way and it's got its own pattern that looks very very different than these two we've never done case against case we've never run that well I just said that we had done most of these analyses in the last few weeks this is all fresh off the press so that's a great idea that's it's to be done yeah yeah yeah I think yeah I think that's right and I think that we really need to also show that there's a reliability in the signature at the level of a single individual such that you could predict their disease status based on a connectome McNabb and that's what I'll be showing next that we can do that to a limited extent I think that would kind of address your concerns of that heterogeneity not much so what we've not not okay so we do know from other studies that have looked at healthy individuals as well as patient populations separately and in small groups that there is good test retest reliability and resting state connectomes across time so you know how good is good I'm good enough for science yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's a really great point and I think that these results I think are believable but they'll be really believable if we were we perm you the labels a thousand times of autism and healthy and we showed that this these values p-values are pretty extreme on the permutation distribution that would be pretty convincing that's a computationally intensive analysis and when ccnv supports us with another grant we will be able to announce yeah one time talk had done in multiple MVAs multinational scaling on the data that's another way that you can recover interesting groupings in the data I'm not an expert in these methods but there's there's a lot of these kinds of data-driven clustering and grouping methods I'd love to try to do them on these big data sets nobody else has done them yet these analyses so that's that's a good it's a really good idea you know I just realize there's only 10 minutes left oh yeah that's fine um so I'm not gonna get the detached data I think I'll just walk through the classification result we can stop there here's the classification analysis this is the structure of it so again every subject contributes a connectome and then here's and then we're doing classification and we're going to visualize some aspect of the information to classify are used here's the key step the future pruning now with 600,000 edges if we you know stuff them all down the the mouth of the classifier its performance would be poor we need to prune that down to get to be the most useful features that's where we're using the graphical lasso so this is a novel kind of interesting way of pruning the features so I'll walk through how these steps work by the way we're doing the future pruning and classification embedded within a leave one out so it's not this kind of biased analysis where you did that on the entire data set this is the glass and you know this is where talk and clay and Daniel will know the details of it but very roughly what we did is we did separate analyses on the healthy we concatenated their time courses and we got a mega time course then we did glass on one what is glass oh it's the the objective of a glass o is to find a sparse inverse covariance matrix it's a matrix of partial correlations very roughly you can think of what glass I was doing is it's finding the non redundant pieces of information in the full edge set so the connectome is full of redundancy there's lots of inter correlations between edges that are doing the same thing if you control for all the other edges maybe one connection would disappear it's that is it's partial correlation would go to zero the glass--oh is going to find the non redundant edges of the connector so using glass we get a sparse representation for the healthy sparse representation for the disease then we take the XOR which means we're looking wherever the glass--oh had said there's a non redundant edge over here that's president healthy it's not president autism or vice versa that gives us a kind of a screening matrix that would be then impose on the connectome and those are the edges that enter the classifier so here are the results I'm only showing the big four data sets the data sets that roughly had 150 or more subjects combined between autism and healthy so at NYU classification was 92% and here's the breakdown between healthy and ADHD Oh UCLA 86% U of M hum I guess hometown disadvantage 72% and Utah it was 82 percent those are good numbers that's that's good it's reliable across each individual site and the glass--oh maps to the AI they don't look that similar but you know I think you can might make out certain kinds of things especially in UCLA NYU and University of Michigan that are similar the glass--oh the alternative to the glass ode the more standard method is a univariate t-test for future pruning and we have a boost in classification over the t-test at all four sites so glass--oh is performing better than the univariate t-test so I think this method is contributing something new and is showing features of the data to the classifier so you can probably build a better classifier with glass oh I think that's the conclusion but here is the problem this is another great problem for anybody that gets interested in this kind of thing this is a kind of cross-site generalization this is a map that the talk had produced the diagonal is what I showed earlier that is you test and train on the same site what if you test what if you train on one site get the glass of future proving matrix then put that matrix on another sites connectome and train an SVM classifier well the generalization is not that good why is that we call this the multiple scanner problem and it's an underappreciated problem in the field one of the reasons we're able to build a good within site classifier but a poor cross-site classifier is because the kinds of noise that's contributed by scanner problems and co-registration problems signal and noise properties and things like that we're not adequately correcting for that in our usual methods so that's a great unanswered problem in the field if sharing initiatives are great they're outstanding they bring together a lot of data but until you solve the multiple scanner problem you're not going to get a really great classifier that works across sites um I mean Michigan's well we don't have a good answer to that a V it is a different scanner well the Michigan is lower with insight as well so yeah so the oh yeah measure you only has one scanner yeah it's the GE I wonder if our signal-to-noise ratio is not as good as some of the other places I also wonder we clearly had more motion in our subjects here at Michigan than elsewhere and that's we've seen a lot of data sets our motion tends to be higher I wonder if we need to be doing more things like giving people by block or something like that to keep their head still I don't have a good answer for that um the last thing to show was cognitive tasks but we don't have time for that so I'm just going all right oh really gonna go over what do you think where do the last second okay I'll blaze right through this cognitive test so everything I've talked about so far as biomarkers and disease there's no doubt that that stuff is important but another huge thing that we do in fMRI is we try to figure out the mechanisms of cognitive processes that are relevant to disease it turns out connectomics can be very very helpful and revealing in this area and I'll show briefly how to do that in resting state it's easy to get the entire time course for the entire experiment and task what we do is we essentially what we do is we chop so here's a task I give people pictures of faces I give them pictures of houses and I'm interested in the mechanisms that how brain regions are communicating with each other when they're seeing faces versus the control condition of seeing houses for those that think this is a silly example faces houses is the usual toy example when you're explaining an FM I ask it's just a silly example everybody uses so I take the time series that's face specific concatenate that and generate a connectome just like I did in the resting state I take the time series that's how specific concatenate that and generate a connector so you know I've seeded the brain generated connect them for the faces one for houses and then I take the subtraction every single subject is contributing a face connectome and a house connectome and a subtraction connective and I analyze it just the way I did before and I come up with one of your shaded talk graphs by the way you call these graphs talk graphs that's what the great Japanese Computer Sciences economy all right emotion regulation so in psychie in psychiatry we care a lot about emotion regulation my own pet hypothesis is that there's a lot of people walking around with emotional abnormalities they feel too much fear or too much sadness the ones that have disease are the ones they don't have the right kind of ability to regulate the emotion process so two hits need to happen you need to have aberrant emotion responses and then you need poor regulation of it so regulation refers to amended voluntary modulation of your own emotion responses we can test that in the scanner we give people harsh pictures like this picture over here we ask them just react to that picture the way you normally would just maintain your reaction in other trials we give them the same kind of harsh pictures and we ask them to reappraise modulate reduce your internal emotional reaction to that picture and so the subtraction between reappraise versus maintained is those cognitive processes that are involved in emotion regulation and an activation analysis for those that have seen these kinds of results this has been done 30 40 50 times many published studies this is the classic map you get dorsal medial prefrontal cortex is activated during regulation you also get dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex here in here and then kind of inferior parietal regions in dorsal attention network here in here everybody has seen this picture very very common result here's the connect Tomek result so just focus on the top half what you're seeing is that during emotion regulation default network becomes much more connected to the visual network at the same time the dorsal attention network becomes more segregated or anti-correlated with the visual network so connect omeka lee we're seeing the mechanisms of connectivity during emotion regulation and that's a very hard thing to see otherwise without using the connect tonic methods why are there two maps because task based connectivity is not fully reversible what you get is two maps that are very similar to each other but they're not identical so we have to show them both and kind of establish that they are similar and sure enough they are the fault network and visual and dorsal attention and visual buy the key findings in the top map as well as the bottom map so I want to put it out there that connect helmick's is not simply for disease identification connectomics is a very general way of analyzing neuroimaging data and these p-values are you know really huge like we saw before and this is only 40 subjects so connectomics is pulling out a lot of very useful signal in the data and showing you perspectives on the data that you wouldn't see otherwise in conclusion in psychiatry we want to develop biomarkers traditionally that's been done with activation analyses Connect ohmic imaging is a new approach we've done studies in ADHD in autism and show the connectomics is showing very interesting Network abnormalities and these disorders they can also show mechanisms of cognitive processes during tasks once again I want to thank my colleagues and collaborators and thank you all for your attention ADHD in an autism or any of them on medications at the time and does that play a role do you think in how this connectivity might be modified by pharmacological agents I don't think it would be advisable IRB wise to treat people prior to this but if they're already on medications is there a way to correlate that and look to see if there's modifications based on pharmacology so with the online datasets we don't get as rich phenotypic characterization as we typically get when we have our own datasets so the problem is the online datasets does not include history of previous medication in ADHD it's usually not that big of a problem the reason is that stimulant medication probably does not leave long-term signatures on the brain I in it yeah the one that I really worry about is schizophrenia it's almost impossible to get clean data from schizophrenia with people that are not medicated and the online data set on schizophrenia does not contain medication status so this this is a real problem these online datasets are great in terms of the number of subjects you get but the phenotypic saan them is kind of skimpy no questions the question how is struck in the cognitive test that the blocks for red and blue will much smaller part of the total picture then for the diseases yeah is that a big conclusion so there's there's many things that could be going on one is in a way these are within subject analyses where each subject is their own control I bet you that we probably have better ability to suppress signal and noise in a within subject design like this a B there's far fewer subjects here so the kid that could contribute to why certain weak signals are not found and see it is plausible that cognitive processes like emotion regulation affective Street regions of the brain whereas diseases like autism which has been conceptualized as a diffuse hypokinetic a disorder or altered connectivity disorder would have massive signatures all over the brain so that's at least three reasons why these two things could differ and also I should say that task based connectivity and resting state connectivity we don't have a good feel of how those two differ because there's very few task-based connectomics studies ours could be among the first or the earliest task-based connectomics studies I should say there's plenty of test phase connectivity so these are all reasons why those two could differ do you think we'll ever get through the day when many mental disorders will be diagnosed by imaging functional connectivity yeah that's hard to say I think we'll get there and one thing I will point out is that you know I used to be the director of the ADHD clinic here in Michigan it's a tiny little clinic that operated once every two weeks we to close it down because it wasn't enough people to operate it our standard way of diagnosing ADHD is with neuropsychological tests they're a neuropsychologist here okay then I'm not gonna I'm gonna be insulting about neuropsychological tests it's clear that they have no predictive value whatsoever so you send people in neuropsychology to do four hours of testing and the literature clearly shows and this is very expensive test because it's a fantastic these tests are well-designed they're thought of by very serious people but if you actually look at how much destroyed information they contribute it's not we're already better than that with this stuff and so you know these these 82% detection rate yeah it's a little bit inflated because we've taken a very refined sample people with ADHD comparing them people without and we've changed the base rates from what you might see at a clinic and things like that but these tests are probably better than the kind of things we're doing right now so yes compared to the crappy things we're doing right now yeah I can see a day when we use things that are a little bit less crack sure okay this is a very interesting question so let's think Chandra again thank you you know that thing about neuro psychology let's chop that Vidya
