you okay everyone we're gonna go ahead and get started I'd like to welcome everybody this to the CCB Wednesday seminar series today I am honored to introduce Jonathan Pritchard as our speaker dr. Pritchard is from Stanford where he's a professor in the department's of genetics and biology he's also an HHMI investigator his lab focuses on studies of genetic variation including the history and structure of human populations identification of variants that contribute to common diseases and quantifying the distribution and extent of human variation and adaptation and today's going to share some of his work with his hypothesis of high end he could enter connectedness of genes leading to an omni genomic model of disease but heard heritability but first in the same vein of network interconnectedness I wanted to share an interesting fact that I just found out yesterday about dr. Pritchard some of you may be familiar with an Erdos number which is the collaborative distance that you are from publishing with Paul Erdos the famous mathematician others of you may be familiar with the bacon number which is the distance that you are of being at a film with Kevin Bacon there's an elite few who actually have both the bacon number and an Erdos number this is called a bacon Erdos number you add them together dr. Pritchard is actually a member of this group with a bacon heiress number of six which is the same as Stephen Hawking Carl Sagan and Colin Firth and one better than Natalie Portman so with that I want to invite you all to join me in welcoming dr. Pritchard to Michigan [Music] [Applause] great well thank you so much that introduction thank you all for being here today today I'm going to tell you about work that we've been doing in the last few years to to think about the architecture of human complex traits and so this is going to be perhaps more of a conceptual talk than the usual of these seminars but I want to tell you about our general ideas in this area as well as our more recent work since paper that we published last year on it so since the birth of genetics that there's been a tension between two different kinds of viewpoints of inheritance which early in the 20th century were referred to as the Mendelian and the biometric schools so so the Mendelian School of course from Gregor Mendel has this idea that there are individual unit elements in the in the genome which we think of as genes now that that actors switches with really distinct effect on phenotypes and in the starting in the mid 19th century there was also an alternative view which was pioneered especially by Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton about the inheritance of continuous traits and it's often referred as the biometric view and this is a an early version of a scatterplot that Francis Galton developed which shows the the numbers of children whose heights fall into each box with respect to the the height of their of their parents and and so in order to analyze these data Francis Galton essentially invented regression so in the early 20th century it was really unclear how to resolve these is really completely different seemingly very different viewpoints of inheritance and to a large extent but they were reconciled through a famous paper by RA Fisher in 1918 it's now referred to as the infinitesimal model and the key insight an ambitious paper was the idea that if you have a large number of low sigh but we're each locus is actually basically like a Mendelian switch and then you count up the number of up alleles and down alleles that each individual has but that can actually generate a continuous distribution of phenotypes in the population is approximately normally distributed and and so that that paper really helped to resolve the idea that there was some kind of inherent conflict but between the two kinds of notions now following that I think it's fair to say that throughout the 20th century the main advances that have been made in genetics where with their essentially reductionist sörman dealing unlike approaches so there's this classic kind of a style of experiment where you identify a mutant that has some phenotype and then you do molecular work to understand what's the way in which this mutation is damaging some gene and what's the molecular pathway from that gene to phenotype and so on in the background of this kind of reductionist approach I think that although there was this history of thinking about infinitesimal models most people in complex trait genetics I think had the idea that that complex meant that there would be a handful of low sigh of modest effects that would influence any any given trait but there would be a countable and understandable set of low-side and so last year I went back in and did did a bunch of reading of papers from the 1990s to get some sense of of how people were thinking about the architecture of complex traits and and one example of this is from a paper from one of my graduate school teachers Neal rish and Neal was leader of a study of autism they had a study of several hundred SYP SYP hairs where each member of the pair had had autism and based on the heritability of autism they done power calculations estimated that if there were a handful of low sigh but they wouldn't have very high power to define some some signals of low side driving autism and in fact in this study they found nothing and so it's such a rescue this Neal it's a very careful analysis to to get some understanding of how many lows I must be involved in in this trait and so he writes these results are most compatible with a model specifying a large number of low sigh perhaps even more than 15 and so I think this gives us a sense of where people's thinking Mars at the end of the 20th century um in terms of thinking conceptualizing and complex traits now of course in the last dozen years or so genome-wide Association mapping has really transformed our view of the inheritance of complex traits and the first observation I think is that those traits that that we look at it is hugely polygenic so this is a Manhattan plot birth schizophrenia from the the latest meta-analysis is from 2014 they're about a hundred and fifty thousand individuals in the study the identical each dot here as a single snip that they're arranged by a genomic position the y-axis is minus log P value and anything above this line is considered genome-wide significant and they reported a hundred eight genome-wide significant low so for schizophrenia in that study but perhaps even more striking is that together these loci only explained a small fraction of the expected genetic risk for schizophrenia and what's become clear from work for many groups is that in fact there's an enormous amount of additional genetic variation that's not significant at current sample sizes that together actually drives the bulk of the genetic risk but for this trait so there's a paper involved in Pisani example a couple years ago that estimates that the genome-wide significant low sigh are responsible for about ten percent of the of the variance in in disease risk that can be detected in in this size of sample and the rest of ninety percent are a low sighted and that are not significant but in aggregate you can tell that there's a signal of association with the trait so today I want to argue a couple of things to you first of all I want to argue that but from the typical complex traits there's there's an enormous number of low-side that contribute to risk for these traits and and most of the heritability is actually mediated through genes that do not have direct effects on the trait in question so so that kind of paradigm that I discussed a few minutes ago where you've got a Mendelian locus where there's some understandable molecular mechanism linking that gene to the disease I'm going to argue that that that really doesn't hold for the bulk of the genetic variants that are contributing to a trait and then and given that I think that it's important to think about new conceptual models but how we think of the molecular processes that that link genetic variation in the genome to complex phenotypes and I'll tell you about the model that we've been thinking about in this context and the the first half of the talk or so I'll talk about work that was done in my lab by Evan Boyle who's a graduate student no known relation to alan Boyle and Jung Lee who was a postdoc in my lab he's now an assistant professor at Chicago so one main rationale for gene mapping that's been used is this notion that that when we find signals of association that this should lead us to genes that play key roles in disease biology and this has sort of been one of the guiding principles of doing genome-wide Association studies um and so the first point that I want to make is that for many traits of heritability spread very very widely across the genome and also thinly in the sense that the most important loafs I don't actually contribute much variance and so I would argue first of all this suggests trouble for this expectation that there the genetic basis of heritability should be concentrated in two key pathways that sort of make biological and intuitive sense so the first observation is that the many traits including schizophrenia most of the genome actually contributes to heritability so so this is a plot again from bogden Paso New York's lab where they're using a statistical method to estimate how much of the heritability of this disease can be assigned to snips from each of the chromosomes and so each bar here represents one of the chromosomes and they're ordered along the x axis from the number of snips on each chromosome and on the y axis by the estimated contribution to the heritability of schizophrenia and what you can see is that you can basically predict how much signal is coming from each of the chromosomes by chromosome length and so the way that we interpret this is to mean there's an enormous number of loci that are spread relatively uniformly across the genome with relatively modest contry oceans each and you can see that there's a small outlier here which is chromosome six chromosome six contained contains the c4 locus which has been studied by Beth Stevens and Steve maccarrol and it it's perhaps that the biggest single hit the schizophrenia and that that's responsible by that little blip off the line here if we compare this to rheumatoid arthritis you can see in contrast again chromosome six in the MHC region individually that makes a huge contribution to rheumatoid arthritis and then the rest of the genome has got again this sort of polygenic background signal that that's contributing the remainder of the genetic genetic basis of RA so one key question that we might ask is if we drop below the the chromosome scale how much of the genome is actually contributing phenotypic variants for any given trait so to think about this it's important to think about the structure of LD in the genome so sort of in a cartoon version of this we can think of the genome as being subdivided into haplotype blocks which represent regions of snips that are in LD with one another and then you might imagine that if you have a causal site somewhere then then because of linkage disequilibrium or correlations in the genotypes between nearby snips then then all of the snips that are in this block what will tend to show association signals so so if we look at if we look at what fraction of snips in the genome show an association with a trait then this is essentially giving us something like a weighted average of the of the faction of haplotype blocks in the genome that contain variation affecting the trait so so one analysis that we've done is to look at the extent to which we just look at how much of the genome is contributing to two variants for different traits and we started with height so Heights a trait that had been interested in for various reasons and there's a really excellent data for height and one thing we find is that most of the genome has got contains variation that we can replicate which we can replicate the effects on hype so in this plot what we've done is we've taken snips from from the largest single meta-analysis on height this is giant this contains about 200,000 individuals so for every snip there's a test of Association that tests whether that snip is associated with height and then we take the estimated direction of effect from Giant and then we would polarize the the the snips by that direction of effect and then we look at the average of amount of effect in the same direction and replication data set which is relatively smaller okay so each snip here so each dot here represents a cross bin of a thousand consecutive snips ordered by p-value in the original discovery data set okay so over here on the right these are the snips that word genome-wide significant in in the original meta-analysis and we can see here that the average effect size of these snips in the replication data set is about one and a half millimeters so the genome-wide significance tips these are having fairly modest effects on height and there are about 600 or 700 genome-wide significant low Seifer height each with a typical effect size of about one and a half millimeters and together these explain about 16% of the genetic variance in height and perhaps more interesting to us was that genome-wide we see a signal of replication basically throughout the p-value range that even for snips that are nowhere near significant we can actually on average we're getting the this the direction of effect right on and from the giant study and we can actually we can we can replicate that with an average effect size that's about 10% as big as the genome-wide significant variance so what we estimate here is that there's an enormous number of snips with the tiny effect on height so so we've in separate analysis were estimated there's at least a hundred thousand variants across the genome that are affecting height but typically with it is minut effects I so in fact most of the population variance in height is coming from this this huge number of very very weak signals a second kind of analysis that we can do is is to look at look at the distribution of test statistics or for a given trait so it so you might be familiar with John stories pi0 which is part of the false discovery rate framework and that's a technique for estimating the the fraction of true positives and in a data set and so we can do the same the same kind of thing we're actually using a different method a relief idea from Matthew Stevens called a char so now we can look at the fracture estimate the fraction of of significant tests in haplotype blocks of different sizes so what you see here is that the large haplotype blocks we estimate that around 70% of these large haplotype blocks contain a variant that affects schizophrenia risk and and that that goes down to near zero for very small haplotype blocks and so each each dot on here represents about 1% of snips and there there Bend by the size of the haplotype block and an averaging across across all snips we estimate that about 57% of all variants in the genome are linked to a causal variant that affects schizophrenia risk so this this is giving us a sense that for both hike and schizophrenia as well as well as many other traits that a huge part of the genome is close to variation that affects these phenotypes so so if you consider the typical size of haplotype blocks and the genome is on the order of about 20 Kb this is suggesting that about half of the 20 caping windows in the in the genome contain a variant that's affecting each of these traits and and this also implies that the traits like heightened schizophrenia that there must be more than hundred thousand causal variants across the genome okay so a second kind of observation that I want to make relates to the locations of where variants are that affect complex traits so a number of groups have studied the colocation of genome-wide Association signals with active chromatin from different tissues and in general the conclusion has been that the jiwa signals tend to be enriched in chromatin have active in insult i % for the diseases you're looking at but in in reanalyzing these data one thing we have noticed is that surprisingly perhaps it doesn't really matter whether whether the snips it in chromatin that's broadly active so for example promoters of housekeeping genes versus chromatin that active only in the most relevant cell types which are the you know kinds of chromatin regions that you think of us as having you know cell type-specific functions so to the first point many groups are for example here in a paper kanakas crisis lab of showing that you you see clear enrichments of apparent ability signal in in chromatin that's active and the right kinds of tissues so for example this is a plot of enrichment of of the parsnip enrichment of heritability in in different types of active chromatin so if we look at snips that lion in chromatin that's active in central nervous system cell types then there's a clear enrichment for bipolar disorder calm on the other hand for example if we look at a fasting glucose we see enrichment of of snips of g us hits into chromatin that's active in the pancreas okay so so a natural way of thinking about this which we think is wrong would be that you know perhaps perhaps the these kinds of snips would would be primarily sitting in in chromatin that's involved in for example cell type-specific activities and in the pancreas that there drive of pancreas specific biology so one way that we could look at this mystic is to take is to classify the chromatin in the most relevant cell type is either being uniquely active in that particular cell type and so for example if you're looking at immune cells you could look at chromatin that's that's all there's got the new cell type-specific function the somewhat specific as well as broadly active chromatin so as i said for example promoters of housekeeping gene and so on and and of course in principle we might expect that the these G wast functions if they're really about chromatin function they might be highly enriched in this cell type-specific active chromatin and in fact what we find is that it's not the case at all so the hero for three examples for schizophrenia and central nervous system cells rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease that immune cells we find that the the person that parrot ability is roughly similar when we look in in uniquely active chromatin in the most relevant cell types versus broadly active chromatin and of course there's an important negative control which is that we can look at snip the heritability of snips that lion in chromatin that that's not active in the in the relevant cell types and in those cases you see that those those snips actually contribute very little heritability so so basically what we're seeing here is that snips that are inactive chromatin in the relevant cell types are highly enriched for contributing to trait variants but it doesn't really matter very much what kind of chromatin they're in the last point that I want to make is that when when we look at the is that we see interesting things when we look at the kinds of genes that that signals lying closer so for example if we look at rare variants with really big effect sizes we look at the biggest hits and jiwa studies these often identify core genes and core pathways or gene sets that kind of makes sense given the biology of the disease but if we look at broadly speaking where is the bulk of the heritability coming from so including all of these minut effects then actually we see that that the heritability is very broadly distributed across the genome without with only weak regard to what kinds of genes you're looking at so providing the genes have to be expressed in the cell types that make sense and so here is one way of looking at this we looked at gene ontology categories so each dot here represents a single gene ontology category and then on the x-axis as the number is the fraction of all snips that fall into that geo category and then on the y-axis as an estimate of the proportion of heritability that's assigned to two snips in that gene set and so what you can see first of all is that the main driver of this is simply how is nothing to do with what they function the gene set is it's simply how big that gene set is so so there's you know fairly generic category of protein binding is the highest score by this we do see some some enrichment i there's a distance off the diagonal for a couple of categories that make sense of example ion channel activity and calcium ions now in contrast if we if we look at a Crohn's disease you see much the same kind of pattern although the enrichments are so that the enrichments are flipped here so we see some we see enrichment for immune responses inflammatory response and then categories are related to nerve cell function are under under enriched but but these these positive and negative enrichment are relatively weak compared to that the overall tendency that the whole ball signal is basically driven by the size of the gene categories so this brings us to the core question I think you know what why does so much of the genome effective at any given trait and I would argue that these observations don't really fit well with our usual conception so conceptual models of genetics where there are simple links from from gene to function I should say by simple I mean understandable so okay so just to quickly recap and for many traits and diseases first of all that the genes with trait relevant functions contribute just a small fraction of total disease risk the heritability spread widely across the genome we do see that low-frequency large effect very instant have clearer enrichment in in gene and types of genes that really make a lot of biological sense and then lastly the contributing variants tend to be highly concentrated in regions that are active chromatin in relevant tissues and just as a side note that the general interpretation of this is that most of these effects a mediated through effects on gene regulation rather than protein coding okay so in thinking about this we wanted to try to develop a a model or perhaps even a strawman model that you know to put these data into some kind of conceptual framework and so so we heard in our paper last year we referred to this as as the Omni genic model we suggested that there are three kinds of genes and and this is the definitions of these genes is particular to any given disease so different diseases would have different classifications so the first what we refer to as core genes and these are genes were that have direct roles in the disease so so for example for schizophrenia you might think of genes involved in synaptic function or proliferation or for autoimmune diseases you might think of genes that are involved in an inflammation or processes like this um secondly our peripheral genes and these are these encompass all of the other expressed genes in in relevant cell types so so we think that essentially all genes that are expressed in in this all types of tissues that that play a role in the disease wound up acting as trans regulators and together these actually drive most of the heritability of any given trait and then of course the third type of genes are genes are not expressed in the right cell types and these really don't contribute anything so as I said that the key observation here is that most of the phenotypic variation is actually due to the regulatory variation in peripheral genes um just as a side note quite a lot of people have asked me how does on me genic relate to general term of polygenic and i actually think if this is having a in our use it has a more precise meaning so so the term polygenic has been around for a long time that people use in a lot of different ways so you know people might use it to mean that there's a you know perhaps a few dozen genes that are contributing to a trait and there are other models as statistical models that are assuming that every single snip has got a nonzero effect so I think if the term polygenic is being extraordinarily vague and by Omni genic we mean something much more precise which is specifically that every Express gene in relevant cell types is likely to matter for the for a particular trait so in thinking about this this model I kind of have this idea that you this notion that you've got these core genes that have the tend to have direct effects on a trait and and often they're affecting the trait through their effects on on geni put through their gene expression levels and then these only sit in some cellular network of a regulation so all of the different ways that that the regulation of one gene can can affect other genes these effects are sort of percolating through this network and we might imagine that let's suppose that there are hundred core genes and you know typical tissue has got more than 10,000 genes expressed and that then there are more than a hundred times as many peripheral genes as core genes and so then we start to get an idea about how it might be that peripheral genes are actually dominating the phenotypic variance so to try to make this more concrete I think about a system trans regulation of core genes so suppose that we've got some core gene here and we imagine that expression of this core gene can have effects on only on the disease of interest so some of these effects come from genetic variation that's insists and we know from eqtl studies that the assister factor tend to be relatively large and and they'll typically lie close to the core genes or certainly usually within 100 KB or so and then at the same time we also have the possibility of trans regulators so these are other genes elsewhere in the genome that are having trans effects on the regulation of the core gene and and so these are genes that we think of as being peripheral now what's the relative contribution of sis and trans effects to regulation so so I went back and read a read all the studies that I could find that are trying to estimate that the contributions of Sisson transgenes to system trans effects to expression variation and there across a wide range of different studies in different organisms different tissues there's a there's a a global estimate that around 30% of the explained heritability comes from sisyphic and about 70% of the genetic effects on expression is coming from trans and however okay so we can put some numbers on this plot here abouts so for a typical on average gene about 70% of its variants and expression is coming from trans effects however the trans effects individually tend to be very very very small so it's actually very hard to define these these signals when you do eqtl mapping and just to illustrate this join y'all leo one of our collaborators made this plot where she took all of the genes on chromosome 22 and she did sis mapping so theythey see the effect sizes in units of the z score but the sis associations and then and then she took all the snips in the genome and plotted the distribution of the largest z scores on all the trans associations and this is without any multiple testing correction and it's a you can see which you know so usually people do multiple testing corrections which kind of dampens down the the the trans effect but but even without doing that you can see the trans associations are much much smaller in in size than sis associations even though in aggregate the trans associations contribute much more total variance and this effect is even exacerbated when if you remember that if you think or if you take account of the fact that what actually really matters on the scale is is the square of this so if we so the the contribution to variance is proportional to the square of the Y axis which makes the assist the relative magnitude this is associations even much much greater so together these observations imply that a typical gene has to have huge numbers of trans regulators so most of the trend most of the variance is coming from trans but the effect size is so small that we can't find them it that and that means that there must be an enormous number so so if we imagine now that a given complex trait has got perhaps tens of core genes and then each core gene has got perhaps hundreds of trans regulators then this starts to give us some idea about how we might start to pull in most of the genome to affecting that the complex disease in question ok so this this maybe gives it leaves one more important question so why do the core genes tend to contribute so little heritability to any given trait so so for the Afeni example that i showed you earlier in the talk i said that the 108 genome-wide significant hits together on explaining about 10% of the variance in disease risk but but we know that sis eqtls do tend to have relatively large effect sizes so so why is it that individually that there we don't see more core genes with big effects on the trait so so in the last few minutes of the talk i want to suggest a simple model that that we think hints at what's going on so so let's think about the how we might model that the the phenotype in terms of a bunch of system trans effects so let's suppose that we've got a disease but it's suppose that we've got some some continuous trait why so you could think this is height or you could think of this is some kind of continuous underlying liability distribution for a psychiatric disorder and then that we're going to predict that the phenotype and individual Y as as a linear combination of first an average phenotype in the population Y bar and then a sum of effects over m core genes and eat we assume that the the effects of the core genes are mainly exerted through their expression levels and so it's a gamma here it's going to be that the the average effect of a unit change in expression of of this core gene or on the on the phenotype Y and then and then this term here and this term here the XS are going to represent the expression level of each core gene so X IJ is going to be the expression level of gene J and individual I and this is this is the mean so we're just going to standardize this as differences from the mean and then there's some random noise term here ok so just to summarize this what we're modeling the we're going to predict in this model the phenotype of an individual is a linear combination of the effects of the regulation and a whole bunch of core genes okay so now the key question is what in this framework what drives the phenotypic variance of Y so so we can compute the variance of this quantity here as follows so so if we just run through a little bit of math we have a set of variance terms so these show the either variance and the expression of each of the core genes x the x that slope back to squared and then you get a sum of covariances and these covariances represent the covariance and expression between different core genes so you get this simply by applying rules of probability to this basic model okay now from what I told you before um we we have a lot of data that suggests that that the variance and expression of any given gene on average should be driven about 1/3 by by sis effect and about 2/3 by trans effects however in in work though I won't tell you about we believe that these covariance terms tend to be dominated by these trans effects from peripheral genes and now the key thing here is that there are M of these M of these variance terms where these are the where m is the number of core genes and there are almost M Squared of these covariance terms so what winds up happening is that although these these various terms are about one third system two thirds transifex these covariance terms are dominated by by the trans effect and there's actually a huge number of these there are nearly M Squared of these terms annually M of these terms okay so that whole argument depends on how big these covariance terms are and so I just want to tell you so heuristic aliy about two extreme models that produce really different behaviors so one kind of model would be that the core genes tend to have independent effects on the phenotype so you might think of of core genes that sit in completely different pathways and and and so so these core genes are reach affecting your phenotype value but but they're regulated independently from one another so that they're interacted by some whole set of peripheral genes now we would expect an but a typical core gene that about 30 percent of its expression variants on average is coming from from sis effects close to the core gene and then about 70% of the expression variance is coming in trans and because because in this model I'm suggesting that the core genes are regulated independently those covariance terms are 0 and so what winds up happening in this model is about 30 percent of the heritability well--why close to core genes and this actually really seems inconsistent with the data where I showed you that but for most G was sick most geniuses there are no big hits okay so now let's think about a second model where core genes tend to sit together within co-regulated networks so now let's suppose that we've got two core genes that that sit in the same pathway or involved in the same process so for example for coronary artery disease you might think of multiple genes that are all involved in inflammation or all involved in lipid metabolism and it's very reasonable to expect that in that scenario these peripheral that they may often be Co regulated by many of the same trans regulators and and now in this case that the SIS effects are still acting independently for each core gene but the trans effector tend to be shared across core genes and so so in the math that I showed you these wind up generating a lot of covariance and so that this kind of co-regulated network kind of acts as a as an amplifier system where most of the heritability for the disease wind up getting transferred from these is this effect down into the peripheral trans regulators and so so we think that actually this this model is kind of giving us a sketch scenario for for how it is that the most of the heritability is actually not coming from from core genes so I will just give you some brief conclusions now and then then take some questions so first of all as I as I've said we we would propose that gene regulatory networks tend to be sufficiently interconnected that essentially all of the genes that are expressed and disease relevant cells allowable to affect the functions of core disease related traits secondly that most of the heritability for typical traits is driven by snips that are outside of core pathways and and as I said we refer to this as an anomaly genic model that was hypothesis secondly I've argued that although there's a lot that we don't know about trans eqtls yet I think that the model is consistent with what we do know so far about assistant trans eqtls we we estimate that trans the fields estimate the trans variation typically drive about 70% of the expression heritability with but with really tiny effect sizes and as I argue to you we think these co-regulated gene networks kind of act as amplifiers for this peripheral transacting regulation um and then lastly I want to talk about the you know what this might tell us about about gene mapping and I should say first of all that I actually think of these models as kind of being a you know partly largely of interest just to you know sort of get a better conceptual understanding of the molecular mapping from genetic variation to phenotype but it is important to think about what you know what these kinds of models suggest for for future mapping studies so I think in general that when people do gene mapping that it potentially serves two different kinds of goals so the first one is genetic prediction so so if we look at somebody's genotype can we tell if they are at risk for coronary artery disease or breast cancer or other phenotypes where they are potentially clinical interventions and for genetic prediction chivas is absolutely essential so most of the variants that these typical traits as I argued is driven by tiny effects and those are spread uniformly across the genome there's quite a lot of reason to believe these are mostly driven by common effects and so the only way to get good at this is to is to get really really really big sample sizes and of course the good news are on that is that G was just getting cheaper and cheaper it's sort of happening automatically now because there are multiple big bio banks that are on the order of half a million individuals each there's there's getting to be a lot more genotyping going on in medicine so I think that we're not not far from from a state where we you know many many millions of individuals available for 4G losses for a wide variety of different traits okay I think a more thorny question is how do you identify core genes and pathways and you know core genes and pathways and not that relevant to the overall variance and disease risk but but they are what you care about for understanding the molecular biology of a disease or potential for designing therapeutic agents and I think this is much more difficult so what I think is going to be important as some combination of first of all deep sequencing perhaps concentrated on exomes because it's easier and cheaper to find rare variants with big effects so it's a when you find rare variants with big effects the this is sort of the hallmark of a disease that's you know sort of proximal in the causal pathway to it to the disease and so I think that's a great way of finding core genes although not all diseases appear to have these secondly I think it will be helpful to do it more to take G whilst data as the G was continued to grow and probably to combine these with methods for Network inference and so in my group something we're really interested in is developing new ways of getting long-range network information to understand transia tiel's better and and we're also really interested in statistical methods for combining data from transy QTL mapping with g wass information so I should do inference on which of course and which with brittle genes but I think that these are actually these are hard problems that will you know take the field several years to to make real progress on but I think that they're not on solvable problems so let me close now these are key people have been involved in the project so it's a Evan and yang who led the work for the first paper as well as chanyeol EO who who led a lot of the work and a lot of the new work and second half of the paper and here's a picture of us from our lab reunion ASHG a couple years ago I think there should be some some people in the audience in this picture I see Roger there William there so anyway I'll close there and if you have any questions I'd be happy to thank you for a really stimulating talk pretty impressive ideas I'd like to give a little background and perspective on this about three points one is heterogeneity of disease which wasn't mentioned which surely affects the court gene analysis second is the decision was there was no genetics of anemia because was buried in all the other variation and the heterogeneity of the clinical category genetic background the slide you showed about the very very tiny effects remind me a comment published by a famous physicist Michael Simon like 1893 saying that all the important findings of physics had been made and the future of the field would lie in the sixth decimal place three years later came Lincoln x-rays and the whole atomic structure and many many other things so the behooves us to ask what is missing in this analysis and that's my third point which I think what is missing is a historic contributor to heritability analysis which is environment and then genetic environment interactions which are admittedly more complex to study although this is quite complex and under study for sure so I hope those comment might stimulate more efforts among all of you then your excellent environment so I look hard at the environment and the interactions with these genes Thanks thank you thank you for those comments yes I mean I won't let me just touch on the third point I completely agree with you about about the importance of environment as we discussed it I mean it's really been difficult to measure at large scales although I completely agree that it it's clearly important that's something that the field needs to to work on I mean I think that it's you know it is it is nonetheless clear that there's an enormous number of variants across the genome that you know that affect any of these given traits and you know that's even true when you go down to things that seem more atomic like gene expression that you know it's I mean the data that we you know the day that we in the field have got to a collector chose theirs you know for any given gene that there's already a highly apologetic background so you know so it's soy so I think that there's still something really important to explain even even before we get to having a full understanding of environment even though I fully agree with the importance of getting better environmental measurements and understanding g'bye interactions better thank you for that comment hi Liz meliora so we've done analyses for the giant consortium on hi-8 and BMI I know you alluded to some of that and it's very clear that as you go across the whole genome if you get independent low say you increase the heritability explained so you can take the whole genome and now users essentially a polygenic score and look to see how well it predicts certain diseases and I'm curious you know since you're proposing that you have the main genes as well as other gene sets are in trans effects that work as networks if you can do gene set enrichment analyses combining gos data with gene expression data and then do essentially sensitivity and specificity curves to see at what point adding more of the genome actually contributes to sensitivity but then hinders specificity because you're also adding noise as you go across the genome and how much of that you've done with these polygenic models or you know these more complex models that you're proposing explain heritability for diseases does that make sense I think I got most of that but maybe you can just say that the idea again would be a so the idea is that most certainly as you go across the genome you're gonna increase the amount of heritability explained so in your if you want to maximize that you do want to use the whole genome and you can take someone's whole genome alternatively if you want to stick to the genome wide hits you have very clean hits a lot of sensitivity and very good specificity because they're positive and negatives are very good but as you go across the genome you add noise as well as the positive hits because some of them are just going to be false positives that happen to be specific to that data set so when you have that kind of you do have a very specific I guess signature in one data set let's say arduous analysis where you have the positive hits but you also have noise from that specificity of that data set and you go to apply it to other data sets to do sensitivity and specificity combining that with gene expression or other methods have you looked to see how your predictive statistics sort of changes because depending on if you amplify the noise versus a specific signal you're gonna get very different results in those settings so we have a not sure if anybody's really being able to you know incorporate expression data very in a very compelling way into these kind of analyses I mean partly for many of these traits you can't easily get access to the tissues that you really care about and then I mean a second point is that you know very often gene expression changes are you know sort of downstream consequences of disease rather than rather than drivers so that I'm actually this has been done more DNA methylation perhaps you know like that people find that you know a large fraction you know there'll be a large number of CPGs that are differentially methylated between disease and not disease but it's not really clear how to incorporate that into a genetic predict I mean you know that might that does maybe in many cases correlates of disease but it's very hard to know what is a driver of disease so yeah I think it's more more space for working these like on the polygenic prediction I think they're really thank you here so according to your model on the sistren trans regulation model if you come close as a sis sis effect low side and this affects locus then it will affect only the local gene and if it's a trans effect locus it will affect multiple gene then the liberal predict trans effect locus is a chess effect qtr for managing and CC fact qto is likely to be only a 5qo for one gene it's that so yeah okay so I mean I was maybe a little bit a little bit quick and rushing through this so it's so what I mean my assumption is that most trans eqtls of variants that are QTL for a gene close to the variant so so when you're thinking about a you know if you think about a core G of candidate core gene then there may be may be sis it may be variation close to it that is this variation there are other snips elsewhere in the genome that a trans eqtl is often acting through you know through a gene product that's cousin sister down now of course you know something that's assist you know sometimes the the core gene itself will be a trans qtr for other genes elsewhere in the genome and so if you do the math a little bit more carefully and there's actually an extra extra term its accounting for you know it's basically transferring heritability from the you know it's a from one core gene trans to another core gene but under the assumption that's not very many core genes those wind up not really contributing very much it's the individual transit papers are small yeah how much you're that kind of get to your attrition yeah yes sorry thank you it's asking about the core genes for the rest of the room do they have distinct you know in degree outdegree types of network properties you envision that and because there are genes that you can pick out from a network that have a distinctive sort of architecture around them locally in the network that others have described as core genes in other ways so I I don't know if there's a connection between your use of that term and that network structure use so I I guess I don't think I don't really think of those being a direct connection but your good questions a great question so I think that in you know and I think it's depend on the disease so in you know in some cases you know you've got you know maybe cool jeans that are structural proteins that are you know crucial for you know for some process that is on the disease pathway and you know maybe those would be unlikely to be Network hubs in other cases there are transcription factors that are you know telling a cell divide in this direction of de violent so you know differentiate in this direction or in that direction and then you know probably those those really are network hubs that you know may may have huge effects on many genes so I you know I think we're clearly disease specific yeah okay wait two parts that I miss it's a fish's infinitesimal model you know I guess I think of that you know sort of as being a metaphor you know it's sort of saying well you know if you have a lot of low side then you can get a continuous distribution Bella means pre genetics right so with pre-modern genetics well I don't think if this is I mean nobody's rejecting it I mean it's I mean you know that's uh I mean that's a very simple model that you know it says that if you have a lot of if you have a lot of terms you get a continuous distribution I mean I think if this is being much more mechanistic I mean now in the you know now in 2018 we have a lot of data and so we could we can come up with more complex models I mean I'm always you know we still work on transcription translation even though the central dogma has been around for a long time so so in my mind it's difficult to conserve this I mean it's hard for me to figure out how you how you have direct arrows from the centrally ever expressed gene to disease and you know so for example you know I showed you that snips that are you know in an active chromatin is active in every single cell type of the body will have you know what will increase your risk of schizophrenia or decrease your risk of schizophrenia you know but there presumably also active and many many other traits and you know in it it's hard for me to it's hard me to think that I should you know I should go and say the postdoc into the lab for four years to try to figure out the molecular like a simple molecule or link from from that from that gene to the disease you know maybe in case some cases there are but but I think that we need to think about other kinds of models that you know that can account for there being an enormous number of small effects if spread beriberi thinly across the genome and I mean we already know as I showed you that you know even gene expression itself was hugely polygenic and you know and so sits in my mind as a sort of coherent model but that I you know my opinion explains that explains the de leur and I think to me it's more appealing and imagining that that you know every single every single expressed gene has got some direct link to disease yeah I have a sort of naive question but it kind of follows up on on this one which is so you have this you you know your basic models to calculate a variance of a complex system by adding up unit variances and then saying that the covariance terms are going to swamp the others okay but on the other hand you know a covariance term can be both positive and negative so that the covariance could actually be detracting from things now so the question is you know in some sense what are your observations arguing that if you have such a model then the only place that the the missing variants can come from is the covariance terms or is your model predictive in the sense that it says you know these covariance terms will do something and why why do we know that you know basically says things are varying - you're arguing that things are overwhelmingly burying together yes that is a great question I skipped over that and the interest of time but so so I completely agree with use of the like the covariance is only only important if so that there are two directions terms those gammas and then the covariance and so basically the product of the two gammas times the covariance has to be generally positive and and so I believe that's biologically plausible because you know you can sort of imagine so we know that often you'll have a co regulated pathway that you sort of where the genes are contending to go up or down together so that gives you positive covariances and then you also need those gammas tend to point in the same direction and and I think that's often plausible any of you I know I think of let's say an inflammation Network then then you might imagine that up regulating different genes in that network well you know cause an immune cell to be overactive so these biologically I think that that that's intuitive to me although you know wouldn't have to be that way I think that I think the fact that there are you know essentially no core genes with really big effect sizes I think that that lends some support to the you know - that that model be being the most likely model among the ones who've considered you know course you know I can't reject the notion there are other models that we didn't think of it would also explain it so anyway so I think it's the other things have looked at it's the most consistent with the data and then you know biologically I find it appealing thank you for that so this is sort of related to that most of the time the interaction terms are homeostatic right we X outside of cell-fate differentiation it's generally pushing things towards a set point rather than away from it if I understood that response correctly but that most of the time the interaction terms in transcription in RNA abundances are as it were negative they are toward the homeostatic setpoint and not away from it with the exception of cell differentiation so height might look very different from this but I there's a related question about how the heritability adds up so if you take your results in giant and you infer from that how many real effects there are based on the agreement in sign with the other study and you add up all of those variances how much heritability in height do you get and how much expected difference in height you get between different human populations okay so so our estimates for height where that there's on the order of a couple hundred thousand variants with effect sizes that are on the order of 0.15 millimeter something like that 145 cells what's that sells okay and so to do the calculation that you need actually have to make an assumption about the the mean square which is actually a bit harder to estimate the way that we do it but anyway you know if I sort of ballpark that then the numbers are roughly on the right rein for most of the population standard deviation heights about seven centimeters and you know we're you know like like this factors of two fudges on everything but you know we're not so we're in the right ballpark we're not an order magnitude off from that so it's kind of coherent the second question you asked was about population differences and and it's actually something that I think is pretty interesting that nobody in the field that I'm aware of people he understands which is that the polygenic risk scores don't predictions don't really transfer very well across population so for example for height if you if you build a polygenic risk score model in europeans and then and then look in other continental groups it can predict the population means fairly well for non Africans but it predicted that Africans should be much shorter than they actually are and it's not totally clear why that is but you know we could think about explanations like you know maybe there's some kind of mutation bias so that maybe mutations tend to think you know the average mutation tends to increase your height more than decrease and then and then there's a whole set of height increasing alleles that are not present then in Europe the presence of Africans and not in Europeans there's models like that but transferability I think is kind of a an interesting conundrum [Applause]
