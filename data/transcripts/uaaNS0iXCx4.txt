okay welcome to the bioinformatics seminar series today I'd like all of you to help welcome Rachel Schwartz from the University of Rhode Island she's gonna be talking to us today about some of her work from her her new lab relatively new lab looking at evolution from a computational perspective and kind of a methods development sort of perspective so we'll be seeing kind of some of the new stuff that her own students have generated in the lab so I'm looking forward to it so welcome and you can so take that and so this is work some of its what I did is a postdoc but a lot of its what my students have done over the last year and a half so I'm super excited we don't have a lot of definite results yet but I kind of telling you where we're going I'll preface this by saying I'm an evolutionary biologist coming into methods development rather than a computer scientist coming into genomics so all of this is sort of from the lens of evolutionary biology on a whole variety of timescales so this is the med school so I figured maybe I better sort of point even the direction of evolution and why it's so important and so this is a quote that probably most biologists put in their talk at some point and the idea that nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution so all of the things that we think about including medicine you can look at with an evolutionary lens and so you can think well we have a microbiome that we're interested in or interested in studying and interested in dealing with for our health that comes from an evolutionary perspective right these microbes evolved to be symbiotic you can think about your physiology as a product of our evolutionary history and you can even think about our behavior this way how we act as a product of our evolution if you don't want to kind of get into thinking in these broad terms this is a phylogeny you're not familiar with it it's how we basically think about evolution whether you're talking about these viruses here or you're talking about the whole tree of life and from a human health perspective a lot of people do use biologically to understand post switching in viruses or parasites so so here in red here this isn't my work but it's a nice example the MERS coronavirus we ask where does that come from and then we might extend that to say well if we know that the MERS coronavirus is closely related to the viruses and camels or viruses in that do we expect to see similar host switches in viruses in the future and I think that tends to be true that bats tend to share their corona viruses with us so there's another one up here this is the SARS coronavirus and again you can see it's closely related to the bat coronavirus so there's a very direct application of biological I don't tend to think at that time scale I tend to think it much larger timescales so for example how do we think about the evolution of butterflies butterflies up here this is a monophyletic clade inside of all the moms and butterflies timescale or even it kind of this time scale so this is all metazoan and this is one of the questions that has emerged in the last eight ten years is what is the group that is sister to all other medicines so you have is it the fungus how about you guys but when I was in high school or so they told us that sponges were sister to all other medizone and then another group came along I think this was out of Kathy Dunn's lab and that don't know Tina for is our sister to all of their metazoans and then depending on how you do your analyses you come up with funds is being paraphyletic and cnidarians unifor is in here so we're still trying to understand how species are related which kind of boggles my mind sometimes because you'd think for a lot of these groups we'd have this all figured out by now but we really don't and so like I said I think about evolution in a whole variety of time scales so we can think about sort of all of metazoans or even all of the Tree of Life but we can also narrow this down I like to think about cancer as just very small-scale rapid evolution of I guess it populations really more than species so here you'll see that this is somewhat similar to the phylogeny that I just showed you so you have a bunch of individuals and out of those individuals you have one individual that goes somewhere else and involves into a new population or a new species depending on sort of what time scale you're thinking about it so cancer at the small scale although evolution at the large scale we need some way to understand how these cells or how these species are related so I want to take you through a little bit about how we're thinking about getting the data to build phylogeny x' or at least some of the challenges first and then the method and I'll illustrate this with a great example in birds people really like learn they're pretty they have all the phenotypic diversity and so people get really excited about how did all this phenotypic diversity evolved and so two thousand eight the study came out and this is really sort of the first big phylogenetic study and they said and you know in 2008 this was genomic we have 32,000 KB 19 loci and it was published in science and they said we have figured out the relationships among groups of birds end of story we did it there it is you don't have to know the relationships among birds but they do say like here are some of the historical relationship so if these colors are here's their relationships and they're like we're done and they do have a really nice large data sets unfortunately if you look at different data sets you still get different phylogeny so there was your 19 loci they've upgraded in 10 years not even 10 years so now we have 12,000 low-lows I pretty much most of the genome the parts that they're able to align they've only got 48 species because never done whole genome assembly in alignment that's a lot of work so they're limited on the number of species but that's a lot of data and then they said though we have the relationship among birds we're done end of story we have whole genomes that's it you can imagine that that's not really the end of story the third face there and along came another group and they said well you guys only had 48 species we don't have as many loci but we have a whole lot more species and therefore you know you're not accounting for some of those really long branches so we have the final answer for the bird relationships so if you take a look at what these look like and you can think about both of these are very large data sets a lot of them are pretty similar right that's the horizontal lines right there showing very similar relationships and then you have things here the flamingos and greed here sort of in this in group versus here they're closely related to pigeons and Sandra so you see some pretty dramatic changes thinking that they're related to the tropic birds and penguins and herons compared to pigeons and sand guys out there so a lot of them are the same but there's some pretty dramatic differences and we don't really know what the right answer yet I was trying to think of other cases where you have very very large data sets and people get wildly different answers you come up with a lot of data for that but we're still arguing and we still don't really have a right answer and the problem with this is also that getting a new answer even if you're not sure that it's right is very expensive so if you've ever done whole genome assemblies in alignment they're time-consuming to do to do the sequencing and the assembly they're expensive right the very long list of people that participated in this project and they actually designed whole new methods to build phylogeny out of whole genome data so it's a pretty big deal and we still really know if we have the ready answer so this is kind of the answer that I like to think of it's like work smarter right and this is what everybody wants to do you want to spend less time on your project and less money and get the right answer so this is the first thing is for me to understand getting the right answer in phylogenetics we need to have the capacity to get large phylogenetic datasets more rapidly and with less money so I'll sort of go through one of the processes that people have been doing to kind of shortcut this and this is similar to what one of what the second targeted locust paper did and then I'll explain how we're trying to shortcut this process so if you have five genomes for which you have assembled the whole genome or at least a reasonable draft genome you take these genomes that you do in alignment and we pull out the parts of the genome that are common so this is the ideas you get orthologs this way so these are the parts that tell you something about evolutionary history and they have enough of a common sequence that you can align them and then you can understand you know what changes have occurred so that's fine it's not great for five genomes you spelled to assemble five genomes but it's not terrible it doesn't really scale up so doing 48 genomes it's hard to account for rearrangements four chromosomal fusions for all the other things that are going on in the genome but this is the approach that's taken by these this group that works on ultraconserved elements to develop markers for phylogenetics so they do pull out a lot of markers but you still have to do the assembly and the alignment for those five feet so if shortcut it to some extent which is how they get the target looks it's also the approach that's taken by is what's called anchored file of genomics they sort of custom-designed markers for particular groups of organisms the user trying to get markers that are more general for example for birds and looked at the uce website and they say these markers work really well we've tested them we don't really know what they are but they work so just don't worry about it right which is kind of what sorry we tend to ignore the function of things I'll get there in a minute so that's fine um I know a lot of you work on humans so you may have forgotten how hard it is to get a really good genome sequence for an on model organism uh this is the sort of the undergrad version of talking about genomes right no I told you tell students you know you have a genome it's like a book right it's got chapters yeah but when you try to sequence it you're looking at taking all those books and throwing them in the paper shredder and then trying to figure out how you put it all back together so this is the non model organism it takes a lot of time to develop a polished genome that you can really work with the thing about this is that from my point of view I don't really need the whole assembled you know right I want these core sequences and want orthologues that tell me something about evolutionary history so that's the idea is how do we just get the core how do we get those orthologs without going through the whole assembly and align applause so this is what I did as a postdoc and we're still sort of developing the software as we add more pieces to it over time and the basic idea here is that you have a whole bunch of reads I have tiny little short reads there but figure they're usually a hundred base pairs or 200 base pairs and we take all of them and we assemble them all to get it and our assembly we figure looks something like this maybe you don't throw them all in maybe you just subsample them the assembly might look like this so there's your de burn graph if you're familiar with de bruin graph genome assemblies you have parts of the you know like this that our have no variation you have parts of the genome here that have a lot of variation and you have a part over here that's maybe got a little bit of variation so the parts that we're interested in from the point of view of phylogenetics are the parts that you could still align maybe they don't do this much variation but you have some variation and you're able to kind of trace that history so when your genome assembler spits out its result it should fit out something like that so we have a part of the genome where everything all your species align to it pretty well and that gives you something like this where you get that locus for each species but there's no variation and then you have parts of the genome where they're so variable that they lie it that they just assemble separately right your assembler thinks this is just two entirely different pieces of the genome they assemble separately and then of course your individual species will align separately here here so you get both of the pieces back but you don't really know that those are orthogonal Eve Airy usable for a phylogenetic and then over here you have that piece of the genome where it assembles together maybe it picks one of the one of the alleles from the heterozygote and you're able to align your data from both species back to that from your two different species and you get both sequences the sequences from each species that you can then align together so you know what the ortholog is doesn't really matter where it is in the genome you know that that's a north log and you know that it has variation and you're able to see the alleles for each species separately so it looks something like this we take all of our sequencing we throw it into a thumblr you get kind of this composite you know it's a hybrid take your reads from your individual species align those back get your genotypes your alleles for each of your individual species get rid of some of the extraneous stuff where you don't have enough data to do so genetic and you end up with an alignment so you have data for each species for each locus that you're working with in order to buy logic so this is all one pipeline we've developed and it was published in 2015 I call scissors and so yeah so we have a piece of software all you need to start with is your raw data that comes off the sequencer or I guess your trims data really provide some recommendations for trimming right you take your raw data you run it through the pipeline and it produces a whole alignment mostly just of the variable sites because there's just so much data to work you can pull out there we go so we have a pipeline and as part of pipeline development you have to show that it work so it works so here's a phylogeny of mammals tend to use mammals for a lot of things because there's a lot of data for mammals so there we are we have very high bootstrap support for these groups here you can see sort of one or maybe the most accepted hypothesis for the sisters leads all other eutherian mammals there we go right I can show you it with other species too so this is a project I worked on using scissors to understand the evolution of lasagna so you can think about this have a longer time scale applied to sort of understanding how Phil Lesh money--i parasite has evolved across different continents and what timeframe that happened did it jump continents are we looking at an older time scale for the South Ocean but made it sound all very nice those are ends up being really fast so we've shortcut this whole assembly in alignment process what I haven't done with scissors is tell you that I have phylogenetic data that gives you the right answer like I said we don't really know the right answer yet so what this is is another subset of the data supporting one of the other alternate hypotheses for mammals so there's three major hypotheses about the sister clade - sort of the main group of eutherian mammals in this case the sister clade comes out to be just the applet area and then the sloth on the armadillo or the remaining mammals here so it's kind of good and it's kind of bad because I can't tell you that we have the right hypothesis or the right yeah the right answer from scissors data yet but I can tell you that scissors data outputs results that will give all support for all of the hypotheses so we know that the data that's in there it's there's something about the data where different data sets are supporting the different hypotheses so it's not that somebody's wrong there's something going on with the data that we need to kind of work out so this is what my lab is really interested in right now and say this is sort of the meat and potatoes of the lab and then we're starting to look at these loci more in depth so where do you have signal in the low side for how species are related and where do you have I shouldn't have that boys here it's really non phylogenetic signal it is signal not of how the species are related but it's signal of how the genomes are evolving in some other way whether it's convergence whether it's incomplete lineage sorting so ancestral shared alleles there are other reasons that we see this kind of non phylogenetic signal so it's not just noise but we do want to sort it out if our focus is to understand PW so this is where I get to talk about the stuff that my duty my postdoc I've been doing for the last year and a half or so so we have a lot of data and we have a really fast way of getting data for pretty much any group for which there's raw sequence data so here's a phylogeny that we know pretty well so now we can start to ask out of all that scissors data which parts of the data tell us this answer which we know to be pretty good and which parts of the data tell us something that we know is not correct so one thing that we've worked on a lot and phylogenetics if you go back they 20 years now to the point where we were sequencing one gene or two genes and building phylogeny off of those people have for a long time said well if you are looking at relationships kind of on this timescale within the last you know couple million years you would want to use a gene that has a fair amount of variation for that time scale and that's going to be a fairly rapidly evolving week right because if you use a slowly evolving gene it's not gonna have any variation on the other hand if you're looking at this part of the phylogeny down here or even older really we want regions of the genome that are evolving relatively slowly because if we pick regions of the genome that evolve fast you're going to have multiple substitutions and well over well in the past we've tried to model those and say well we can make predictions about what how many sites have multiple substitutions and where they are you kind of want to avoid too many models and too many parameters so in the past people have said well we have a list of genes and they actually give you a list you go back in the books for genes evolving at the right rate to look at that part of the phylogeny so we've known for a long time that parts of the data are useful and parts of the data are misleading and now we've kind of said well we have the whole genome so we're just gonna forget all of that we're just gonna assume that the whole genome this is but this is what we're starting to look at is we take the whole genome we take all our data for these known relationships run at their scissors and so my postdocs getting data that looks like this so we have a lot of sites that map to our composite genome so it's working pretty well we have a lot of variation so work with a lot of data and most of these sites are correct I'll show you what it means I correct let me explain this figure a bit so Bob's been working not only on preemie but on rodents and Pecora which are the ruminant mammal and so he's able to find relationships just like I showed you for primates where he feels confident about those relationships and then look at which data supports which I bought so what this is showing if you just focused on these higher up blue parts of the violin plot that's how much support there is in the scissors data for relationships that we know to be correct so each each grouping of organism is supported by a whole bunch of sites in our data so that's good so we feel like Susan's producing data that allows us there are some relationships some splits between the data so a single site will let your species into two groups and so there's some relationship look over here where there are sites supporting those relationships that we know are not correct but it looks like most it looks like most of the time those incorrect relationships are supported by a lot less data than our correct relationship so we feel like scissors are doing good job providing sites that support the relationship that we expect any three now that we have a lot of data and we feel like most of its pretty good but we're also supporting some of these relationships that that aren't correct with some of our data we can start to categorize the data so because we're looking at primate data to start we can annotate it so you can start to say well you have a lot of sites what are they yes are they deena core the UC ours or they pseudogenes anything else so we could put them in categories you've just been working with these categories we have a whole variety of other things that we're interested in but just a little start here and this is you know to go back to what I said before about certain regions of the certain parts of the tree we would think well we want faster sites and certain parts of the tree we want slower sites we sort of expect those faster and slower sites to line up with some of these categories you expect coding sequence to be more slowly evolving because for the most part it's under a lot of evolutionary constraint if you screw up the coding sequence you don't get functional cells or functional people on the other hand pseudogenes you would expect to see you know there it allows for a lot more mutations assumably introns or intragenic regions would allow for more mutations so that's kind of what we're thinking is that some of these categories are gonna fall out in terms of more useful for either overall or it different parts of the tree so it turns out this is partly true so we definitely see different amounts of data supporting different parts of the tree but it is surprisingly consistent across the tree which categories of data are being used for which parts of the tree we're not quite sure if this is just we don't have a deep enough time scale if you go back you know hundred million years maybe we'll start to see different categories so he's getting there going out there yet but this was really surprising to me because I figured that we have you know maybe more coding sequence back here a coding sequence is a little sliver that you really can't see there's not a lot of coding sequence in our data which was really surprising I thought that would be the stuff that assembled because evolutionarily much more conserved and I think some of these are UT ours and some of them are but yeah this really surprised me that we didn't see these different categories sort of having different proportions in different places in the tree so like I said we have a lot of data we're now having some results about we categories we can start to get go terms we can start to think about how well we can model evolutionary change in each one of these lows I don't know about you but if I have a known result and I have a lot of data that I can play with I tend to think machine learning any video yeah so fantastic undergrad who is starting to do this kind of work but she's an undergrad so she has almost no time so I don't have results from her yet but she's starting to take the sort of the good sites and the bad sites the sites at different time scales and say can we can we make predictions about certain categories of data being more useful so that's where we're going like I said you're three of me being at your eyes they were just getting going on all right and so this is kind of where we're going right you want to pull the signal out of the noise which is what machine learning is trying to do which categories of data are useful for phylogenetics and which are may be providing more non phylogenetic all right so I'm gonna switch gears a little bit so I was talking a lot about just getting data in certain categories that is good or not as good I'm not you know with that kind of project I'm not worried about how those pieces of data are changing how they're evolving except for this one's evolving fast and this one's evolving slow and maybe that makes it more useful but one of the things that we're starting to work on my lab is how are those genomes actually changing and in particular what kind of changes can occur in a genome and what kind of changes canticle so this figure is from my collaborator Noah Daniels we co-advised the student who's working on this project I like to say he's sort of the flip side of what I do have a biologist who tries to do a little computer science sometimes he's a computer scientist who works in biology this is not actually a biological data diagram but it's where we'd like to go so the idea here is this is a three-dimensional representation of multi-dimensional space where if you think about evolution as so in paleogenetics we tend to think about tree space all the possible trees you can think about evolution as all the possible states in evolutionary space so all the possible sort of ways that the genome could be all the possible vacations all the possible rearrangement so you can think about all of that is like a giant landscape what we're what I'm interested in is how much of that landscape is occupied and how much can't really be occupied so how how much capacity is there for evolutionary change and how much is evolution really constrained by selection and when talking to my students she's very interested in applying this to cancer because if you think about a normal human cell there's a lot of evolutionary constraint that cell has a lot of functions if you screw it up in a lot of ways it won't work cancer genomes have all kinds of crazy things going on they have rearrangements and a mutations and they have deletion so there's some variation there's some mutations in structural variants in normal human cells but there's way more in cancer so we expect cancer genomes to occupy a lot more of that evolutionary space on the other hand they still have some constraints so we're trying to see what sort of those underlying constraints are and how we understand so that's why a diagram that I showed you previously is that three-dimensional dimension reduction from this multi-dimensional space in an effort to visualize so my student Jana she's starting by looking at evolutionary space by using chemo frequencies so if you take your genome and you chop it up into little fragments and look at those patterns so all those little patterns are tamers and we know that we know a lot about cameras because they get used in metagenomic to distinguish species and communities in in the microbiome for example so we know that Kaymer presence and chemo frequencies differ among species that's been well established you can see here that there's a lot of favors this is for a human genome there's a lot of Famers that are very low frequency and then there's a few over here that are high frequency and so if we try and calculate what's changed between a sample of one set of chemo frequencies and another set of favored frequencies we can start to think about how do you know hanjung and we're not quite there with cancer genomes but we're trying to prove this with human genome generally there's a lot of data for human genomes and we know a lot about human so this is a population structure diagram for humans and so you can see that you know there are populations that are quite conclusive they don't show a lot of hybridization or mixture mixing with other populations and so if you think about these populations has sort of a way to ground truth and you go back and say that these populations could be distinguished based on camera frequencies so that's where we're going with our proof of concept and the reason that we start to think that this might work is an undergrad in my lab a summer project said can we distinguish human populations simply based on Kaymer so that the the presence or absence of the most frequent k-mers so the program match allowed her to just find the most frequent Kaymer's in all of her samples and but I wasn't sure this was going to work but I said well we need this comparison for what Yanis working on and so she went through all these different k-mers humour value and said can we find claimer value for which we can distinguish human population clusters and amazing but she did she found for a k value of 43 you get these nice tender grams so you look at the most frequent k-mers and create a distance matrix based on the distance between based on presence absence of those Kaymer's and from the distance matrix you can create a dendrogram and so we get population clustering the exception of so we have we have a sense that human populations do have frequent Kaymer's that allow us to distinguish them which is pretty cool and it gives us kind of a baseline for saying that the presence and absence of frequent cameras can do this we can probably do this with camera frequencies sort of along our path to think about how genomes are changing when you want to be able to know that we can differentiate these so Jana is using cosine distances to do these calculations how do you calculate distances between a whole lot of femur frequencies and one of the reasons she's doing this is that we're really hoping that we can because of the way cosine distance is calculated things that are very low frequency don't really matter in your distance calculation and so we can get rid of a lot of the calculations that we would have to do to calculate the complete cosine distance so if you think you know how many Kaymer's do you have when you have K equals even just 12 that's a lot of cameras calculate distance for we'd like to get rid of some of them unfortunately even getting rid of some of them you still have a lot of calculations to do so beyond I was able to get this with K equals well we never really thought that K equals 12 was going to give us a great answer and it doesn't but it takes a lot of pot if you're doing this serially so because Jana is a computer science student he said so often convert this to calculating distances on the GPUs so that's what she's doing now is developing methodology to do all of her distance calculations some people use so that we could scale up the K so even with very large numbers of k-mers she can start and of course with human genomes we have very large genomes loss of k-mers but she has an undergraduate who's working with her who's trying to pull out try to use this approach on a smaller genome name like malaria to look at fine scale population structure for example so you've got a number of results like this undergrad so the fact that he made this I'm just happy with that yeah cuz the little little tiny lines and such but there's sort of a group here and then there's a group here as a group here so he's starting to use this approach especially with GPUs and their rapid calculations to pull out the fine scale population structure and this is done of course straight from the raw aluminum data rather than trying to pull out snips or trying to look at my satellites they're trying to process the data in some way so we're trying to use this as so to summarize briefly we have a method for getting a lot of data we have a scissors pipeline it produces data it doesn't necessarily it's faster but it doesn't necessarily give you the right answer it gives you a lot of data to work with in order to understand what the right answer might be so in order to parse out the data to annotate it to say how do we determine categories of data and then develop a methodology we can roll back into the scissors software where if somebody is putting raw data in and you have a sense of the time scale or you have some kind of tree that you're starting to build even if it's not right yet that we could say well with this time scale we're looking at these markers we can categorize them and pull them out in a way that we can kind of filter this data to try to be more accurate and then we're trying to do this work on a more population scale to think about how do you use k-mers from again from raw data to be faster to think about populations and ultimately to think about how genomes are changing and how how much evolutionary constraint we can see again working with the raw data trying to do this in a really efficient way that we can apply across a whole variety of things well conclude by mentioning all the fabulous people that I work with I feel like I don't do it either work anymore my lab does all the work and they're awesome so Bob's been doing all the pulling out of data with scissors and annotating it and working with Sweetland to start thinking about machine learning Jana is doing the population structure work with Kaymer's and all the dpu stuff and all the computer science ii programming things that I really don't understand and she's been working with beta to produce the results from mash based on presence and absence of Kaymer's and then with Devon to think about population structure of malaria and applying her method to other cases and of course there's a lot of funding that goes into this NSF funded our original scissors work and also funded Bob he's on a on an NSF fellowship the next couple years so we're excited about that URI provided start-up and they provided funding for Jana for a summer and they provided funding for the undergrads in the lab the questions so are different people's mix different trees for the same data is the common problem so is there a way to quantify the difference between different three for the same alignment yeah so there's a number of methods to look at how different trees are so there's there's distance metrics between trees Robinson fold distance is kind of the standard method to look at how different they are so that's that sort of a distance metric but then also the scissors data for mammals for example supports the three hypotheses that we know of that that are served well established for mammals so it's not necessarily a distance thing but the interest is in which is sort of the first thing to branch off and which and what that group consists of so sometimes it's distance between trees and sometimes it's which so looking at like the different types of sequence and which ones are more or less helpful for being accurate result isn't it actually kind of not surprising that the coding sequence is just that small sliver just because it's such a small fraction of the genome like did you expect that or you know so I we were thinking that most of what would assemble is being conserved so even though it's a fraction of the genome that you wouldn't assemble a lot of the introns across this time scale so you just would miss a lot of that data and that a lot of what would be assembled would be the highly conserved data which would be coding sequence so that's why I was thinking it would be more of the you know it may be at different time scales that we'll see that pattern because these are primates and if you go back 65 or 100 million years we may start to only assemble coding I guess along that same question if you were to look at other species do the markers you find also tend to match the distribution of both where you would expect to find if you add more species or if you look at like not just primates what you need to do expectedly oh yeah so that's sort of another problem and this is why I don't think will come up with just categories that are good in categories that are bad I think will come up with categories that are good for certain timescales and categories that are good for certain clade and those will differ and so the sort of very simple thing is we'll do this for one or two play then we'll be able to report that or you know this clade or that clade you use these markers what we really are hoping to do is come up with a way of generalizing that so if you get all your scissors data and you can build kind of a preliminary three you have kind of some sense maybe some of the best supported relationships and you can feed that back into a module in scissors to say okay we know something about sort of our preliminary data how do we then filter based on the particularly the nodes that are well supported so what categories at what time scales are supporting we call them Z nodes nodes where there's a lot of distance between them and other nodes and if you can understand the data that's that are supporting those though maybe of a chance of supporting them more complicated notes things that have shorten or no distances so I don't think it'll be the same for every group and what we really want is a way of having scissors be able to filter for that particular Glade or of that particular time scale and this may even be building different parts of the tree with different data because if you have a large time scale and you can't really expect to build the shallow relationship and be deep relationship with the same data set but that's what we can do so how do you parse those things out so I think this is I really like this idea so can you use maybe the number of species involved in loops in the graph as kind of a prior or the tree calculation if so and maybe even some sort of iterative processes refine the branches of the tree you're only looking at fewer species aligning to the burn graph that location versus only focusing on regions where lots of species yeah so you would have parts of your graph that are for species and you could say so we kind of talked about this we talked about having an assembler that would work well for scissors and we talked about having a color deburr graph you're labeling the the reads such that you can parse out you know sort of things that go with with particular species we've talked about a couple a couple ways of approaching it really haven't really tackled that problem I think it makes a lot of sense to look at the debris another good question I guess is that it seems that in both the brain gratification and in the camera calculations repetitive elements are going to be very highly represented because even within a single species a particular image you know the parts of the boring graph that are more complex but still malleable are more than likely just from violent straight there's lots of variation lots of the same easily be the most that's a good question I haven't looked at whether those and maybe it'll come out when we use something that's meant by that for another category say are we assembling a lot of these repetitive elements and do we need to filter them out as far as camera frequencies the distances they would be the most frequent Kaymer kind of whether that's going to affect the distances between the species so I sort of feel like that would be helpful actually because you're looking at the frequency of those gamers so that is what's changing which is what we're trying to calculate the distance population they're looking at the differences between human populations maybe some of these have been yep for the most part it's gonna need some generic repeats to say right so you get yeah so there would just be very limited distances I guess in that case because if you had two samples with Famers from the repetitive region then the frequencies will be pretty consistent so actually one of the things that Jana I sat down and like knew we should just look at what's changing and what isn't what are the things that are changing dramatically between samples and what are the cameras that are common so we haven't done that yet but it's something I've thought about is actually look at what those gamers are I really nice so my question is along the same lines so I'm definitely haven't looked yet I was wondering if well your data was all genomic data not yes yep how many of them coming from coding regions they're just expressed RNA region versus genic I would guess might get fairly different answers yeah yeah we have it we've just been doing very broad brush genomics but yeah I'd be interesting to look at the different subsets of the data in that way say what and then one more question I can this is much broader question but I was thinking that oftentimes if you get to an incorrect answer I guess evolutionarily there still is probably some some truth in it you know some convergence evolutionary pressure you know yeah have you looked into any of your false positives to see what you might be able to learn yes it is species there's a lot of reasons and that's why I said I have to correct myself fortuitous non phylogenetic signal because it's not the relationships among the species but it can be the relationships among machines it can be the relationship the historical a wheel in lineage sorting could be convergence so there's a number of reasons that we might have that non phylogenetic signal we haven't looked at whether that falls out in the particular category yeah a good thing that kind of parts out let's thank Rachel again [Applause]
