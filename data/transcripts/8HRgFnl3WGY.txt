coming I think we're fighting some good weather today so I appreciate all your coming to listen to the talk there's a sign-in sheet that is going around as always please remember just to sign in it helps us justify the pizza so today I'm pleased to introduce our speaker we have David Lewinsky who is associate professor and the Department of Physics so thank you all for coming on such a beautiful day so when Marcie want me to ask you to do this my first reply was that I don't really do tools and technology she said oh that's fine just give a talk about what you do so this is a talk about what I do with a few added things about the more implementation and computational aspects of it but that's not fundamentally what my lab is good at or what we focus on so this is primarily talked about our research and which is about modeling animal development and so [Music] all right so right so simply we're interested in animal development and so the the fundamental question of animal development is of course that we have this egg here and this egg knows perfectly well what it wants to be when it grows up but at least to me it's not remotely obvious from looking at this whether you know this is a chameleon or a chicken or a fish or what as it turns out it's a chicken but you know it starts like this and ends up like this and these don't look the same at all and so the basic question were interested in is how does it know to get from there to there and from my perspective as a physicist what this is is a problem of self-organization that is there is of course a genome inside the ie that tells it that it's a chicken but the genome is not coding in sort of a blueprint like way for exactly where every piece of the chicken goes it doesn't say the eye goes there and there's a certain distance the beak and so on it as most of you know encodes signaling pathways and in which cells will interact with each other that will let them organize themselves into the chicken in a very elaborate stepwise dice and so what we're interested in is how does this self-organization happen you know what makes it work well so this is of course a incredibly vast problem that has occupied many billion people for you know over a century and I don't claim to have general answers what I would like to tell you about is some specific examples and today's main example is going to be about the arrangement of cells in the fish retinal epithelium and so here's a picture of those cells and I will come back to what this means but so essentially I want to tell you today a little bit about background of the retinal comas egg and fish and also about everything with each selection as most of you are bioinformatics grad students is that is that an accurate statement so this means that some of you have a lot of biology background some of you have fairly little biology okay I will leave in the biology background and apologize those of you who already know it so so I tell you about the sheets and about the mosaic and fish with Sicily almost nobody here knows that I and and so specifically how the question of how it precisely control cell fate then I will tell you a little bit more about the the background of how this happens in particularly why we think that the emergence of a very ordered package of cells is related to anisotropic mechanical stresses then I will tell you about models we use to study this which might be called active phone models the more technical term is vertex models and tell you a little bit about how rotational symmetry breaking couples to mechanical stresses I've added in a bit about how we actually implement these things and then about predictions and back to some experiments about the fish I think that's probably as far as I will get although there's more material or for going fast so so the wall starting at the same place we'll start with what is an epithelium so an epithelium is a sheet of cells very often though not always one selfic and and you know connected so the forms a continuous 2d sheet with mechanical integrity and epithelia are of course all over the place so your skin is an epithelium the lining of your gut lining of your lungs lining of your esophagus so forth and so on anything that sort of looks like a barrier or a sheet in your body is probably an epithelium and so these are really one of the basic building blocks of all animal tissue all animal organs and all animal body plants and they come and so um and so this is a blow-up of three cells in epithelium and for my purposes important features are that the cells are joined together in a fairly narrow band near their top so their apical surface so so they're it's quite close to 2d in many ways certainly by the sames of biology it's fairly close to 2d and particularly well there are some adhesions down here but they are thought to be weaker or not predominant for most of the problems I'll be talking about there's a very strong adhesion about here near the top and also behind the band of adhesion molecules in green there's a band of actin and myosin inside the cell of cortical actin myosin and many of you will know that actin and myosin are construct I'll this is what makes your muscles contract but the same the same filaments and motor proteins also exist in cells and so there's this LED band that sort of like a rubber band the bound behind the behind beauty's injunctions in every cell which means that that these things are under tension there's something constantly trying to contract them and this is what's gonna make it look more or less like a phone and okay and for my purposes I will from now on here this is essentially two-dimensional for those for show come in a variety of shapes and sizes so these are just some examples of epithelial cells in different animals in different organs this is a fairly mature of close to the end of development fly I and so there's going to be a little flight as a compound I there's maybe a little lens in front of every one of these structures and see that you know these cells clearly they're not put down at random right the cells these cells to make the Halfmoon had to know they were a Halfmoon and these ones here had to note that there's before of them view rings that way and so on and arranged in a different way from this which is a fly wing where a lot of the cells are relatively disordered but this is going to be a vein and you can see if these cells something different right they they've up regulated a particular molecule along those junctions but they've also made a very straight interface there and this in turn is different from this is the mouse inner ear this is going these are going to be the hair cells they that detects out and and these need to be arranged in a particular way so the point is that that these are sheets of cells but they're sheets of cells with particular structures and particular arrangements of cells and these things intentional consequences you you know you need to get the the hair cells nicely spaced so that they can detect all frequencies of sound and otherwise your doesn't work so well and so so you have to get to get you cells arranged correctly at some point during development and so you might ask you know what shape they're supposed to be and where they're supposed to go and that is what my example today is trying to lab so feasible is v so this is of course the zebrafish it has an eye two of them in fact but focus on this one so if you were to dust the eye and make it cut the center so that this here is the pupil the light is coming in here this is the lens and then it's getting folk the lens is focusing light into this this tissue which is more or less hemispherical in fact without artifacts from from fixation it's very close to exactly an aspherical and this is and this is where the photoreceptors live that are going to detect the light so if you were to touch a little piece of this epithelial sheet the retinopathy I am lift down onto it from above what you would see is this so what's known about this is you will see that there are alternating purple blue cells alternating one in the other so does that so some of you will know that the way we see colors is with photoreceptors that are sensitive to three different or have peak sensitivity of three different wavelengths and red green and blue so the way you decide color something is is you look at how much intensity you're getting in these three channels and you compare them and you say oh you know it's between the green and the blue and so will yellow whatever it's the same way that turns out that they have four different color photo receptors or are four different specialist and sensitivities which are with green blue and something in the near UV so so somewhat above what we can see but the fish can see so what this false coloring is is that the the blue is a transgene flushing chant transfuse this marketing blue photoreceptors and the magenta is marking the UV photoreceptors and so this means is that this fish has to to get the sulfates it's right now really perfectly regularly arranged so it always alternates blue magenta or blue UV blue UV blue be whatever if you look closely you'll see that the unlabeled cells here and the reason they're on labeled is not that we don't know what they are but just that's hard to label for things in one picture you'll see that they're always two cells in between and these are systematically are red on either side of the blue and a green on Uzziah beauty so in the end what the photoreceptors were raised that fish retinas like this so this is really a regular crystalline lattice it's you're repeating the same unit again and again this we don't have this you know birds don't have this only fish have it essentially all the fish have some form of lattice other cases in fact I would say I do not know of any other cases in vertebrates where the position where the fate and position arrangement of every single cell is controlled this tightly without any room for swap you know the case of regular patterns but usually they are so you know this the number of cells in between say they hid ourselves is a somewhat variable it's not tightly controlling business where every cell has a particular fate and is in the right place all right so this is the question how did it make that because we didn't have an eye and it certainly didn't have a right now with our crystalline mosaic of confers so to make this so actually has multiple steps and in keeping with the devil theme that biology is complicated I'm not going to explain everything we're going to focus on one of these steps so really - you need two things so you need one hand so you need on one hand you need to get the right number of cells of the right color so you need two Reds for every blue and no extras none missing this is the we really don't understand well the other thing you need is you that need to position these cut these cells directly in space so they need to be in a lattice that's not naturally what they want to be if you just randomly throw down cells on a surface they will on average be hexagonal so so arranging themselves rec tagging rectangular symmetry is non-trivial in particular if you look at the way the cells are packed I should say they're pictures with yellow outlines here this is always I'm visualizing a protein called Sonia Lok Luden's that's it's the junctions at the top of and so so what is apparent is that the the most the the predominant feature of the way these cells are arranged is that they're arranged in these very straight regular columns and then there's also correlations in this direction somewhere weaker so these songs are really the the thing that comes out first so if you want to know how how does this arrange itself into a crystalline lattice what you need to understand is go from a disordered arrangement cells into cells that are all nicely lined up in straight lines and yeah that is what we want to do we know about how that happens so the first thing is that one of the very nice things about fish indeed one of the reasons particulars is is a system to get studied a fair bit in a biomedical context yes neurogenesis throughout life so I I'm not a fisherman but maybe some of you were fishermen you will know that fish never stopped growing so you know it's not growing when they get killed for some reason but otherwise they actually continue growing indefinitely unlike us we have a definite size and we stop this is why a you can see tails in the fish size distribution and you can have stories about the big one that got away I also never stops growing and that means he keeps on making neurons the way it does this is so as I said the retina is more or less a hemisphere at the edge of this hemisphere there is a zone of proliferative precursor cells that are dividing and you know renewing themselves every since and decide to stop dividing the cell cycle and start differentiating into ourselves so what that means is that I have disordered packing cells here and then leave this packing and sort of attach themselves to the order pattern express themselves in a stepwise fashion so the pattern grows like this columns to the right in this picture so that's pretty suggestive of because it's easier to make regular losses one layer is to agree to rearrange themselves in in fact this is you know throw clean crystals if you need a clean silicon crystal for whatever electronic device you're making right you grow it layer by layer so a few other observations so this is a picture of the cell lines right at the boundary between the the mature compos act where you can see these these clear vertical lines of contraceptives out here the terminal zone with the proliferative precursors and so what you can see is that there really is a change so this is more or less typical of what a proliferative epithelium looks like the if all the cells are growing and dividing their sizes are variable when they tend to make it fairly disorder they it's in this they softly transition from there to well I'm going to make nice straight lines so the other reason is the physical level stage this is like a Deadpool in in a frog only it's a tadpole for fish and the eye has the same grooves in the same way from the terminals on the consoles looks like this and this is incidentally is not far from what your own eye looks like so you can see that this is not right you're really crystalline lattice this is some sort of you don't have large clumps of blue cells together there's some characteristics basically between the blues and you tend to have UV is next to this it's also not really ordered it the way the adults and simply in the if you just look the outlines of the cell it's the difference between the margin here which is more bit more of a mess than over here or this different shade but not as pronounced divot so if this means is that this progressive growth alone is not enough to make a proper pattern do you have that's what is okay this I think none of you care about its queue space unless there are stealth physicists and so this is a long way this is the adult I know is different that makes the cells organize in you know in realizing this one not this one one thing we realized is that there's some changes in my anatomy that have been round about the time that you go from a young disordered eye to a very nice adult comedy and but store that's this thing called the annular ligament that appears is essentially a ring of fairly rigid tissue around the outside of the retinal hemisphere it instantly this is a feature specific to fish mammals don't have it and it's classically said to provide mechanical support to the eye whatever exactly that [Music] it's clear is that if you go from having a floppy hemisphere of tissue whose whose SS are unconstrained to the same you know sheet that has its ends pinned down on to sort of a rigid metal ring say you're changing the mechanical stresses on this thing and doubly so because this the retinas a little bit like a balloon that the inside of the eye is a fairly substantial positive pressure relative to the outside world so you have this this thin sheet and you sort of blowing it up you're putting pressure inside at the same time holding on to the tightly with this with this solid thing so that should induce a tropical strength there should be more pulling in one direction than the other our idea was that maybe this can can contribute to lining up this cells nicely in two columns so yeah it would be that with isotopic segmenting to get something like this not very ordered topics so the cells have a clear signal that tells them the columns go this way and so they know how to make themselves into college so this is work done I actually said the beginning and will say at the end with Iranians Loeb who actually do experiments on fish we are entirely computational model Wars and so our way of getting out whether this was leaps possible and what we should look for a size of it what's to go build a computational model so tell you a little bit about how we build models of these so these that's the point it is that a two-dimensional epithelial sheet what's in anyway it's a lot like a two-dimensional phone so this is an actual phone this is you know these are sort of films between air bubbles put between two parallel glass plates so it's two dimensional and you can see that you know that's roughly polygonal things that look like cells it's wrong on the physics of foams is that it has some surface tension and that is competing with the fact that there's a certain amount of air inside every bubble which you can't compress forever and so the tension is sort of trying to shorten the edges but you can't just to zero because you have the error there is some more with the difference that the holes of what you might call an octave so in the means is that you offer by ATP to forces that sort of don't come from trying to minimize an energy and so for animal what that means is if this were an animal cell it could decide I want to increase the tension on this edge I'm going to target some kind which is going to phosphorylate myosin is the myosins are going to come more active and and suddenly I'm going to pull harder on this edge so so we think of athelia cell pack uses phones there's active phones which can regulate the tensions on the edges in honor of yours is that we have a model in which every inside every cell there's a presser which is you know essentially to keep it near a constant area you can you can vary some how soft or stiff that is but more interestingly that's against and gamma sitting on every edge and we can model various ideas about that's right so yeah one thing to note is that the come together three four vertices you can look at a lot just by thinking about few streets overseas so particularly the the evidence is that the forces that the forces on these Versys are close to balancing in most epithelium this is basically because movements are slow on the timescales of more molecular relaxation and there's a lot of dissipation and drag in these things so so the vertices aren't moving very fast which means that to a first approximation the forces on them have so then if you think about I have three I have three edges coming in they're pulling with three different tensions and and these three tensions have to add up each vertex what that means is that you can learn things about the tensions on the edges from looking at the apples between them so if they all three have the same tension we need 120 degree angles so these three vectors are different on the other hand if I see something more like this with two edges they're close to parallel and a third one this close to perpendicular this is telling me that depends on the two parallel edges must be much higher than the tension on the third edge because otherwise they couldn't possibly sum to zero and so looking at a picture of the cells and focusing on the angles where edges meet you can infer things about the tensions this is not much but but there's a fairly sophisticated framework now for doing this a large number of yeah many images in a you know in a automated way with the right priors to make sure that it doesn't do anything strange like suddenly decide that you know the tensions are a very by factor of a thousand across so so this this force inference game is is a quantitative now in a way that I don't particularly make use of use of make use of the quality part which is if we both if we block some of the three cell junctions in my fish images what you can see is that they are essentially two almost parallel edges perfectly and the third edge coming in close to perpendicular and so that means is that because all in these directions must be very different and in fact in particularly that there's a directional I saw stone as planar polarity it's known how you do this these third example so this is I would say probably president most of them although I mean hasn't been characterizing all of them but some people look it seems to be there and the idea is the following so you have a collection of cells in the plane and they want to pick out one particular directions different from the other so they wanna know that vertical is high tension and horizontal is low tension in cartoon as fashion the way they do this is they have two kinds of proteins a and B that are membrane-bound proteins and it's an extracellular domain so the intracellular domains really don't like each other and use the opposite sides of the cell like this and this defines a vector say from B to a in every cell so you've lost the rotational symmetry in the cell and picked out a special direction you also like all of the cells to agree on what the special direction is and that means that these vectors should talk to each other the way that works is that the excess other domains of a and B like each other so so you have these proteins and what they're trying to do is separate the opposite size of each cell but have a against B across the junctions and this in effect gives you a little and for physicists we think of this as basically a little magnet in every cell and these hours are coupled so that they all want to line up and this picture global orientation in the plane all right so this mechanics plus this idea PCP things that go into our fish mo so in a little more detail the in the fish so clarity is very well characterized in some fly systems and it a few vertebrate systems particularly in fly systems the PCV pathways now we don't really have it well characterized in fish right now we we have identified some of the genes that are involved and they're sensible genes but we don't know exactly out of Florida so so our model is entirely phenomenological what that means is we think there's PCP and so we're going to make up the simplest thing that will give PCP and see what cell size and you know evaluate whether this is a sensible set of assumptions based on whether it give sensible predictions for the things we can actually like that so that means that we only have proteins a and B and these have a concentration lives on every edge they talk to each other and they talk with the with the interactions I suggested so we give them an energy this there's no reason that has to come from minimizing an energy but it turns out that you can convince yourself that for the particular case of player polarity that's not a very big restriction that's the things that are not variational that don't come from minimizing energy only enter it fairly high order in in breaking rotational symmetry in the plane so get away with just an energy and this energy has missions and then it has entropy terms so that not the concentrations try to go to zero or infinity on every on any edge these systems are also set up so that the proteins that like each other like to be at high concentrations and this isn't all things being equal the five of you rather have edges and fourteen concentrations or long edges and so this means that yeah this so there and again this comes from an energy and there are reasons why again is it's moderately sensible to make this come from an energy even though we don't believe microscopically that's how that happens and so the energy is that there is a term proportional with the length of every edge that's the surface tension and then there's a term that says that every cell has a preferred area which gives you attach so then what does not come from an energy and is the interesting new part here is these tensions depend on the concentrations of the PC proteins on each edge so as I said you regulate the tensions and the most obvious with the leading term has to be this linear and so okay so the tension positions are specifically based on what we know about the shapes of the fish cells we think that the presence of these proteins on the edges should lower I mean there are yeah relaxation will dynamically non variation across conflicts where all this means is that we go from the you take two pairs of these energies and we turn this into a whole bunch of ordinary differential equations for the positions of every vertex and then you go and you try to solve that for the position of every birth excited state and for the concentration of a and B protein on every edge and so you have you know is Purcell more or less I guess I'm not doubling the verse so more like 18 verses per second you want to solve all of these coupled equations to see this laughing okay then I normally doing this talk about how you actually deal with with all these equations so so many coupled Odie's is in most cases a done problem from the perspective of numerical analysis it's been safer done for a long time and you something ordinary even lots of them is something that people do very well what is what is hard about these models is that the variables don't remain constant over time because there can be changes in the topology so that is the you can have cells that divide and cells that are lost either table ptosis or text version and the fish the division is pretty negligible but but there are mutants where the extrusion is really important that happens suddenly you who wants to sell when you have three vertices that works it's the one and you need to update you the variables you're keeping track of to you know lose two positions and keep the third position there's also far more generically things called t1 transitions in which it shrinks to zero so that I now have four four edges coming into a vertex instead of three and then it resolves itself in the other direction so essentially I have four cells they've swapped neighbors and this happens all the time the you know the drive the zero and then it will be energetically favorable to pull it out the other way every time this happens again you the variables between things these so the set of differential equations you want to solve changes so this is what makes these models you know anything more complicated than you know sort of taking a standard library ODU solver the way we deal with this is so this code in C++ Victoria did that per se is not that shocking we really make use of the objects in a way that many well-established numerical codes actually don't because you know there are I mean some of the best maybe you probably know there's some of the best libraries for doing some common tasks go back to things written in Fortran 40 years ago and they still work so well that people still using actually use the fact that we rented language to have objects that represent vertices edges and cells leave in link lists so that I can easily get rid of someone I need to and easily stick new ones in when I need to every edge is going to know is going to have the protein concentrations on the edges and the authors are going to keep pointers to their neighbors so every vertex is going to keep pointers to the edges that come into it every edge is going to keep pointing to the neighboring cells so keep the point of those vertices and so on so that they can find their neighbors when you need to know about the neighbors to calculate forces so so this is good in lets you put in lots of topology changes I have to say what is bad about this which we sort of live with because this is research code and sometimes you live with you know sometimes the problems in the code or less bad than the amount of time it would take you to fix them you have to be really careful every time you change the code because there are not natural ways to check that you have you have rearranged the pointers correctly when you merge two vertices if you get that wrong it will propagate downstream and make a mess somewhere in a way that that's hard to back out but that said otherwise you can deal with this the other thing this costs you is that it's a lot less efficient to solve these things so you can between topologies you can use any standard order you solving algorithm you might want it turns out you have to stop all these dangerous you story alert is not particularly worse than anything else and I find this you know rather this are but it isn't carefully the case for us and for other people who use these sorts of algorithms that's the effort to restore fancier things every time you have a topological change negates a lot of their advantages okay so so you know we have it said obviously we have it set up in a way so you can swap in different solvers and but also we just go to first order because we don't gain that much from not the the biggest computational cost is getting cell areas so you need to know the cell area to figure out the pressure and the formulas for cell area is a function of vertex positions for an arbitrary polygon obviously expensive expensive because you have to you know the vertices you have to follow a train of pointers to find that the everything else that goes into the calculation okay so we are dominated by the cell areas in such a way that we can be careless about other things because it you know it's a 1% effect on the cost of car in the area the other the other thing is not completely trivial is that this dynamics of concentrations on the edges and this can be very stiff to exit possibly some house do you all know what stiff means in this context no so these ordinary differential equations wonderfully when there's basically only one time scale in the row if you have an equation to describe these happening on two different times so there's something that happens fast there's something that happens a thousand times slower than it this is called stiff there's a wide range of timescales and this introduces potential numerical instability is generically in a way that makes it essentially unworkable to use and out of the box renter because that algorithm say or at least in particular if you want to use now that the box algorithm you have to use tiny steps that are set by the fastest time scale in the problem and you might really not want to do that if you want to look at evolution on the slow timescale there there are various ways to deal with this which if have using what's called implicit solvers you you pick computational cost in inverting matrices but you you kill off the numerical instabilities so okay so a PC die now is to be very stiff there are if the concentrations get too large or small and they want to relax away from that very fast much faster than the vertex evolution this means that you need to to use us an implicit algorithm it turns out that we use a custom mixed implicit explicit algorithm because if you are dealing with a node ease and so if we know particularly things about the structure of our model that tell us that these mesas are almost diagnol in a particular way and so we we exploit that to develop a particular customer it's called I next at this position that lets us deal with the piece of you dynamics in a way we can live with we also speak careful to implement conservation laws for the proteins and it correctly alright so that is for the Rex models let me so they like shortages and this means that I'll shape the protein C itself a matrix change tensions which means that the concentrations effect shapes and so when these decided to take all the special direction they're going to do it together and you're going to get one breaking of rotational symmetry is that this is very much like and so most of you were probably have some point done the experiment where you take an iron nail and you rub it with a magnet it becomes magnetized so what's going on there is that the iron wants to be a magnet it realized its lowest energy state would be there's always magnetized when you take molten iron and you cool it in zero magnetic field the atoms in the iron can't all get together and agree on which one is supposed to point so you have you have little you have little domains depending on the material hundreds thousands that all feel each other and say okay we're gonna line up this way but then over here some others have outside they want to lay up that way and then they're frustrated and they can't come to an agreement until you have lots of little domains pointing in different directions these domains - they all point in the same way now now it's back to us the other way to solve that problem is if I were to cool the molten iron in a magnetic field from the outset then moments all the atoms would know which way theirs was the point they're supposed to align with the field they would be magnetized from yet I turn on PCP in the fisheye without any signal telling it which way to point is going to try to so you get little pieces of fragments of columns that look like they're trying to line up here and you know over here some cells are perversely excited they want to go that direction instead of diagonally and what are these things match up you're going to lose the other hand if these things turn on PCP in the presence of a point stress that tells them this is the good axis agree and they will make nice long straight comments that is the idea so and we can test whether this is plausible in simulation so the I so the white cells here are undifferentiated no PCP they would there would really be dividing cells out here they're separated by five or six L diameters from what interested in and turns out to be easier to just start with the field of the same number selves than to constantly have division and these leads we're going to by hand take a row of cells and say start differentiating which means become gray and turn on this polarization and get a vector telling you the direction of polarization you can see this is with us and so so this physics is enough to take you from a disordered on a vertical packing to something that's really straight columns lined up it is not it's not completely perfect at it so there you can see there's a defect for example there and in fact occasional defects in the fish it fails where it's supposed to which is it doesn't work if I don't have this out so this is everything the same except that I'm not pulling in the vertical direction and so you can see that that these cells you see are trying to line themselves up into columns and as we go on you will see that you know sometimes lead them to make sort of circular swirls instead of things that are straight and as they grow progressively they do somewhat better but still without something helping them in telling them this is the right way to go they get confused and they make errors and they make considerably more errors than when I have a nice global signal telling them which way they're supposed to go yeah and you can see it keeps on evolving and relax and so on here the big curvy thing alright so so this is what I'm supposed to winter breaks wind supposed to um okay I don't think you want to hear about pneumatics so so let me in and then say I think this model is not nonsense and how it goes back to how it relates to the actual fish so it's a general model of matter of modeling philosophy right biology is a very complicated of course and is if you come from a physics background sometimes there are cases where you're just sure the model is right because you know someone can has silicon atoms and nothing else and maybe you can't solve the problem of what the silicon atoms do but you everybody agrees on what the problem is we don't know two-thirds of what's there and and that is going to be the case for the foreseeable future so even those that are very seem to explain lots of things could just not be the way the fish decided to do it so there's a premium on the model and going and seeing that it connects to experiments it makes useful predictions even there's some chance it will turn out to be utterly wrong five years from now at least it will have advanced your experiments in the meantime and you know keeping you a way to think about the thing that's possible so so this means we should we should try to predict things we should probably check them and and this is much easier said than done in many cases so I will tell you some of the things we can check your some of the things I wish I could check but we haven't figured out how to do it yet so the first thing is I talked about this idea of that in the absence of a global field you should still have columns of fragments and I showed you some pictures here's some more pictures as a lot of and again you can see that these here for example between these two stars the fragments of Kong is trying to line up this is a lesion die that is similarly messed up and in one way and very indifferent all right so so these things appear to have some tendency to wanna line up a knowledge wats okay so there are photoreceptors as well as cone photoreceptors and fish they insert into the epithelium after the cone pattern has been established and what's interesting if they systematically insert between columns and not within columns and so you can see that here that they're all sitting between columns the green is the rods what he does now be the outline of the cells and see if they overlay and all of the green is saying between the columns and this is what you would expect if the vertical the vertical interfaces are high tension because high tension same thing is weak adhesion and therefore you should put ruts it so predicted sister's plan polarization and that means you ought to be able to go find some planar polarize things and the predictions now several of them have so the green is crumbs to be and specifically scrubs to be and what's called the subtle region and so you can see there's primarily along the horizontal interfaces not along the vertical interfaces so this is planar polarity um it's your PC if it's not oh it's interesting that this is crumbs to be because it's not classically a PCP protein a few examples and fly where it is known to be planar polarized and planar polarized in cases where where there's strong anisotropy mechanical forces as well as in protein concentrations as we believe is happening here so that's kind of nice is that you can you can the retina where you generate as I said this is one reason this is medically interesting it's not nice and organized though it sort of and so it makes a big mess instead of doing it in this progressive stepwise fashion but even so what you can see so so here there are more rods and that's why there's more blue mush between the cells but the biggest the big cells here are the cone cells and you can see that they're aligning themselves up into line like sort of fragments of columns still so quickly these cells have a strong intrinsic tendency to to have directional interactions so that idea at least from the model we're fairly confident is good some units that do this so what we would really like to do of course is we would like to remove the mechanical anisotropy and see that we break the back so if you do that in the model just remind you what will happen is appalling so here there's macaque lines up to me and it's making very nice columns now I'm going to imagine that I can magically make make the malignant line yourself if you go away and so and you can see that expand to one direction continue trying to make it but you can see that it's going to do rather worse it's going to start introducing error is not a ton but you know clearly more errors than background and and it's going to and then I'm going to put the ancestry back and it's going to recover and so the prediction is if we could remove the under ligament you would see a region that's disordered and then more or so this is an experiment we've been trying to do for we and by we I mean mostly Pamela I've been trying to do for something like seven or eight years now and and the fish really objects very strenuously to any attempt to do this but you the way you have to do it is so violent that the controls also show disruption in the eye which means it's not a good experiment there's a natural version of this that is not as good as being able to do in a controlled way but there's still I think quickly which is so so this is a five week old fish this is a standard right field edge and this is an image in red fluorescent channel where we have the transgene that's or fluorescently labeled me I know ligament so you can see that this circle sits on top of the eye so there's this red circle around the eye and it's very prominent and there's a strong signal if you blow up you can this is you know high magnification of the layman layman there's lots of red so five weeks old is a young juvenile fish it's just not quite sexually mature and you can take eleven month old fish and a lot month old fish is really pretty elderly so this is exactly the same set of pictures namely the you know standard microscopy and then the fluorescent channel except that here were to be instead just a smidgen of red you can kind of see there I'm certainly not a nice strong running and if you see this this correlates and so there should be lignin tissue there and there's not if you look on this side where there's this little red half moon there's still some lemon tissue that's called the temporal side temporal for reasons I don't know is the opposite of nasal so the side away from the nose um but mostly its lost annually that it will also lose the regular packing of cone cells this is indeed so this is not the same fish but it's a twelve month old fish you'll also elderly you can see that mostly the cells are arranged the in some use is a big mess it's certainly not very regular temporal side where we think there's still a bit of ligament left there are still some hints of columnar order although it's not very good basically the list of the aisles with loss of of the like to do which is the qualitative evidence is quite good that both the appearance of this ligament the disappearance of this ligament in various context in claw is a it leads to disorder in the cell phone that I say there are also mutants that that Miss regulate the inter ocular pressure which again miss regulates in the chemical environment of the retina and they are that also disrupts the D cell back alright so I'm going to skip the new directions and go straight to the knowledge it's so right so what am I talking about so I told you a story about red moco mosaics and this remarkable fact that they have this crystal and ordering of cells I've told you that we have this idea that if the little mechanics might be driving this cellular level regular ordering I told you a lot about how we build models including planner celerity and the general class of vertex models and you see some experiment tests that are not slam dunk but but are at least consistent with our story including the presence the is very clearly a directionality in their interactions and a preference for making column fragments in even the absence of global order and also the loss of ligament in elderly fast-fish and um okay I didn't get to to Ricardo symmetry breaking you this concentrations on edges and cell shape Interactive's a more general one and there are more general theoretical things you can ask about and without my collaborators so as I said this is all done with v lab of Pamela Raymond here at the University of Michigan and we are very grateful because you know I wouldn't know how to keep the fish alive let alone do you know histo chemistry or something like that the period in the modeling side was started by a really excellent postdoc iam Selva who I'm actually this slide is about six months out of date he just moved to the Crick Institute but so he is now often great things on his own and recently the work has been done by students jeremy hydro yo and merrill sensor and as i said we're also grateful to pamela and of course to the NSF which gives us so thank you for listening yes you might have mentioned this when you're talking about the stiffness what are the actual what's happening at such different time scales that's causing this difference so what's causing the stiffness is that you need so okay you have interactions proteins that walk put them all on one edge and then you also have that some term that tells you don't let the concentrations go to zero on any edge because that becomes pathological and that means is you have to sort of have some force that's pushing the concentrations back from zero that becomes large if you get too close to zero and so so where it gets really stiff is if some concentration tries to get too close to zero and then it basically gets to gets beaten back on the past time scale so you vergence is in the right hand side VOD as you get to zero so is that transition from this new cells that grows in this pattern rearrange of Knossos to the new south across so in the adult there's a little path from the central that's the larval remnant that remains disordered because it's the cells that were born when it was a larva and they were packed their disorder packing and these things if you're not able to rearrange themselves substantially once they're fully differentiated and done patterning so it's the new cells getting added on after it becomes an adult that that have a regular birthday any other questions well thank you all so much for coming
