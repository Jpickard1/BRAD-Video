[Music] like it one of all kinds libraries I can make tons of symbolic links I'm doing all this I am just distracted here I try something and worked take away your Texas where's so how do you directly take this time in our series just as a reminder of course this seminar series is a little different than your typical research talks just in that it really focuses on tools technologies methodologies they're developed here or just being used by researchers here there's a sign in sheet going around I know many of you have already signed it but if you haven't please sign it and if you guys can continue moving it along that would be appreciated um so today's speaker is Santiago schnell he is the John a Jack a collegiate professor of physiology interim chair of department of molecular and integrative physiology and professor of TCM and be well thank you for the invitation so I think we have this invitation over a year ago and and the person who was supposed to be talking was might Benson you know he was a research associate in my group and he ended up getting a position in northwestern as a graduate student in he left which broke my heart because it's a fantastic amount of work in my group particularly on this area of protein informatics and you know let me just tell you so I'm not interested how many of you are familiar with my work so I should probably emphasize what I do so I went to have as a researcher so my first hat as a single investigator the focus of my group is on reaction kinetics so we specialize on modeling complex biochemical reactions with a goal of first developing a methodology for understanding the dynamics of the reactions in time and space and secondly for developing tools for to measure effectively the rates of reaction so as a single investigator my lab is a measurement lab so we're focusing on how effectively to measure biochemical reactions at a standardized approaches which are important for biochemistry then my second hand is a science team member as a team scientist what I do is that anything that boils down to biochemistry that I think I can model and I would help you to sort out a physiological or Bionicle question we then help you to put a mathematical and computational model to solve it and we don't limit ourself to differential equation more what we use essentially most of the mathematical and computational techniques available most of the work focus on computing and mathematics not all mix in network and that analysis but with volley rate of that and well the reason I wanted to talk about protein this for this for a number of years we have been thinking about protein disorder first because we find that definition of what a protein disorder is is the relaxed but at the same time there are questions of whether protein disorder has a function from the biochemical and physiological point of view and and you know I have a strong view of whether protein disorder has an a specific function all helps to promote other functions they store they change in structure that's them so and let me tell you why I think this is important so you probably have heard about the repository crisis and your pursuit in crisis goes across the board not only because people are employing incorrect statistical approaches but because of what we have to define standards of what it means to use a term or to do a calculation and in my opinion this is happening with protein disorder so when you talk to a scientist so every scientist would have a unique definition of what they mean by intrinsically disordered domain one intrinsically disordered protein and I'm going to give you an overview of what is currently known at the moment and where we think we are making a contribution and you know I'm going to leave you to judge that and when one of the things that people have been doing in recent years their international efforts to actually coordinate to report effectively any single biomedical and the clinical Sciences in my case are having heavily involved on the biochemical sign on this International Commission that's called a stranded Commission that is handled by the Valentine Institute when a strain that starts by a standard for reporting in similar data and again as a single investigator I told you that most of my work focus on measurement reactions twelve ninety percent of the work we have done is on measurement enzyme catalyzed reactions that have been part of this commission we're coming with guidance of how to report the in symbology data and we have developed a database where people can upload their experiments and then check if you put all the experimental protocols in there whether people can reproduce those experiences effectively and you know currently extend the galius only focus on the experimentalist is the nexus we want to move forward is on the measurement protocols of how people are estimating the parameters when i'd really wanted to do something with protein this sort of similar nature can I sit down the people who work on protein disorder I come with dinosaur coordinates you know my results were were in pain so I started to work very hard contact people who work on protein disorders and you know everyone could all agree whether we should be meeting and those are agree on meeting they say well is my protocol is the right one and not yours so what a size has split from those people and then come with my guidelines and I couldn't explain you how they opened but before that I want to give a brief introduction of what protein disorder is so currently what we know sir you know proteins generally they fold into into a three dimensional configuration from the amino acid sequence where they are not only following in trajectories and those subject trajectories they start to change the configuration of a protein until it reaches a low energy state the lowest our newest ago is the native structure and well technically when a protest intrinsically disordered you have reached that lower you have Fulton flow wearing a stable you cannot see it unique configuration let me show you one they didn't cross like this so people define intrinsic disorder intrinsically on a structure disordered proteins they don't have a single well-defined turning structure in their native functional state so they have a function they have a low energy state they seem to be working under physiological conditions but a region of that protein or many radius of that protein they cannot be crystallized that's the way they're defined so if you don't have a case that extraction then you believe that you have and the reason we know this is because the proteins they can crystallize just a small domains and they can keep stellar in complex because those disorder domains add quite configuration where the income tax and he has been absurd that when you have that intrinsically disordered protein and buys with different partners the disorder domain and watch different configurations but those configurations are unique to the power to a partner that they have in cry when they are doing the divine chemical interaction and you can have a locality so the difference that you have a small domain in one ad and then you can have multiple domains that are linked by other ones and you know this would have larger let me show you what those they look like so if you have an intrinsically saw the domain equal you will go to a lower energy state and then the low energy state one is energy so make it stay if there is free energy suggested but what you always say is the lowest and absolute right so I appreciate that that clarification song so well let me you're saying coming here so when you are in this estate in here in the free energy estate so you can have multiple configurations of the same protein and effectively what is changing between the states it's just the disorder domain is a quieting slightly different configurations but they overlap structure they crystallize a structure that you can observe in the protein data bank is essentially identical the conformation is just varying in the in the free lowest energy state when we observe a small changes in the disorder domains then we can have another another case where you have just a small region that actually is can be fully crystallized at a three-dimensional structure and then you have multiple regions on their highly disorder and they could have different forms and shapes you can have more than 50% of the protein that is highly disorder but you can have somewhere around half of a protein disorder and the challenge is that when you talk with protein off what they do consider an intrinsically sorter protein they will tell you that there multiple definitions in the literature the state of the art what is considered to be highly disordered protein they say that if you have a stretch of 30 consecutive residues that by any algorithm that would give you that they are disorder then did you say that you have an intrinsically disordered protein or intrinsically disordered okay however big the protein is so that's what is considered a set of there so if you go to the literature people immediately start to call their protein intrinsically disordered it's absurd 30 continuous records and I going to tell you the history of that's where it's coming from that's coming from the dunker group so which is a very well known group of protein informatics and they carry out this study where this they investigated the intrinsically shorter in cell signaling cancer associated products and effectively what they DISA day took four groups of proteins so they took the protest were they have human cancer associated problems they have signaling proteins then they have air carrier proteins from the Swiss probe and then they took the non-homologous protein segments that are well-defined with three-dimensional structures and they calculated with their algorithms so that uncle has developed multiple items for exterior and protein disorder how the intricity the sort of those groups appears Peter Duncan has the philosophy that signaling proteins they tend to be highly disorder because the flexibility of the disorder allows the signaling proteins to work more effectively and he tells us well that many diseases are the result that you have a large number of disorder proteins so he would clean that cancer diabetes but Simon they tend to be caused because you have a high number of disordered proteins so when the straw I think it's a question or a statement well because inside is the membrane proteins which have to be had at once nothing less disorder nice or is have access to so the problem yes so let me show you the comparison with those where he throws the trash on because they said the integral you can see how they definition comes in so they effectively what they do is that they put their for protein data sets which are in here then they calculate they they averaged lame the median limb and then the maximum length and you know won't seem that they do which is very awkward is that effectively what they do from this group if they have any proteins are shorter than 30 min was it ratios they remove them from the system you know once I do that removal then they calculate the overall disorder which is what they're doing here and they see that the same proteins which are the orange ones and then the cancer proteins they tend to be either greater than 30 residue so equal they tend to have more higher this order the overall percent of protest which are this order it tends to be higher than those that are the the crystallize and then they did the genetic in Carrillo proteins and he does this as increasing the number of disorder and he finds out always when you are above 30 then you discover that you have highly disordered proteins that's a the way he comes with the definition so and you know the point of the article there is no discussion of why they didn't selected a smaller proteins they didn't did any sort of a statistical analysis determining the whole proteome how the disorder compares and unaffected by setting on that pressure so they just call with a lid that if you have 30 or more continuous residues to be disorder then you clean that the protein is going to be holiday sort you know we were very uncomfortable good definition yes from crystallographic data remember that yes yes so how do you change that well it hasn't changed so the Chinese said once other creation was said nobody has call it into question don't we just write this recent paper right I didn't help I go questioning the validity of that assumption and you know the challenge I saw it with intrinsically this orderly said of course it's very difficult to define because you know you can the only way you'll know that protein is intrinsically so if you attempted to crystallize as multiple times and you can there isn't a formal definition changes from agar into algo I think they've also seen in NMR please visit protons in solution some of them can take on multiple configurations figurations but the other thing isn't so and leaving this blank as night because we were working on this we had a lot of difficulties publishing the guidelines because we have in in two locations we have the infamous third reviewer rejecting the paper for the following grants so we were told that you learn intrinsically sort of protein on intrinsically sorter domain is it's called that way because if you believe as a scientist that that domain is important for its function then you collect an intrinsically disordered protein which is immerse the same way that if you believe that and I'll touch it so you know any other structure of the protein is important then you can call well let me call this an alpha protein Alexis here they play an important role on the problem which is a radical of my division but you know people they tend to be very sensitive to these issues and your disability there is called a bear protein I saw this other domain then they want to call it intrinsically sorter because it sounds hot to call something disorder so that's a way we have we have procedure worked in the literature so what we side to do is you know published violence across proteome which are protein based to character disorder and then and what assumption was very nice so I work with a lot of colleagues in the clinic you know how to missions that tell me that somebody is obese how somebody is told so how do we do that determination that you know somebody has a head that's a slightly motor or you know hands which I sell each other you know we do it by population based matrix what we do is add you know with Thole the communication population in the United States and you know then we do the measurements of high head learn you know fit length whatever you want to measure body mass and weight and then we throw the cure and where the Cure is is setting we assign relief during the meal you are an okay person if you have um the meanwhile you are talking if you know them in your chart so you do up an entire population basis without the maybe we should do the same thing with proteins and then do the calculations of intrinsically disordered and using this population proteomic base measurements we can establish silence that they are supported by statistics and you know that's what effectively we did so what we decided to do was doing a quick Leticia's search and finding which are the most common projects that are currently Stoli in the literature as animal or plant bones and you know we selected the ten most common decided we downloaded the protest from those proteins from unit but from we use a unique reference proteome we eliminate all those proteins that didn't have full amino acid sequence and were not determined as well you know we end up leaving just a small group of eligible proteins which you know represents most of the time over 90% of the proteome because our proteomics is a pretty good science and you know I hope we decided to take all those proteins and systematically use the allegories that we were given access to do the analysis which was the only chance that we have an estimate the proteome base statistics so and the algorithms we could find in the literature that authors were willing to openly share with us there were only two algorithms surprisingly we contact most of the people working the field there are over 50 algorithms available in the literature nobody wanted to share that algorithm so we only find one was the I loop read group because they have it as an open-access and this is a sort of operational algorithm that actually what it does is a comparison between globular proteins and those and it has an index for calculating the energy uploaded proteins and Missa however that was interaction of the energies and then when you deviate from being a globular protein effectively they consider a disordered protein so excessive is a very empirical definition based on how much joy a structure based on the energy and the configuration they part from the typical globular structure if you are not gonna your consider disorder is not a very objective definition but it has been widely used and considering the high and it tends to have some disadvantages are going to show you very soon one will look at the distribution then they're all the distributions are the cargo desk use like 48 out of 50 when share the algorithm second and the algorithm descriptions it's part of the description but they're willing to share it and you know more we were fighting over idea to actually get all the algorithms that we could and in fact so we had had our paper rejected multiple types so we have tried to publish after the guidance multiple papers to share this other Atlas and the reason we cannot publish it is because we can use more algorithms and the reason because you cannot be more algo is because nobody is willing to share so those are the so though those are for the Commission so that's for anymore so if you had an insight that is intrinsically disordered so we have managed to enroll at least as kind of for measuring disorder for reporting and similar data but is only for a similarly data so we haven't managed to adopt this guidance universally across the protein structure field it was as far as I know that's at least two more groups one is Davy Jones in UCL who has given this order pad so full source code and another group is out she Jo in Australia and we are currently working on those two but you know the regs again so the reason was added so we decided to go first with the physical chemical base algorithms then there they were sorry comparison base with all the bases so we are adding those two currently but again so the numbers of those are available and you know I challenge you just to try to find out online or even contact the author to see they're willing to share the algorithm it's only a handful so now that we're in the open sense either so this the state of the art so you try to get people give you the algorithms you know somehow they want to keep it under the hood the I will experience that people who actually have the work mode on the protein structure they're more willing to share their arguments and even help you to implement that well the people who work on the protein informatics particular that is sort of an area they tend to be very generous on sharing their well you can use their tool but you have to use their websites and they don't allow you to actually use their website to upload an entire proteome you can only upload one protein at a time or two proteins but they don't let you to actually do a full proteome analysis so that's what the challenge is you can use their algorithms so you can use the I going on on a web server to run only one protein to proteins and you know we tend to know more than once but of course then our IP address but God block because of course we want to run versus of products the lingual imperative for an entire year so the sense that we have been facing so with this but anyway let me tell you so the other arguing that we use because I'm good friend of the group so if there's a sample and they have effectively in this symbol which is funded by the European community they have three islands called several they have hot loops and then they have River 465 and Kohl's is not very effective because it tends to overestimate disorder and a family goes in a signer vessel belonging to one of several secondary type a structure so order or coil loops depending of certain definitions I don't want to go through the details because I would like to explain the guidance our time is running out then we have the the hot loop that essentially analyzes a calls when they have this C alpha B factors and effective size measuring the angles Mahmood change and based on how flexible they are it would give you a probability that your disordered protein and then finally this one that is a neural network trained are going they're actually using the X RC coordinates in the protein data box and if you are missing those coordinates then they never are going would classify those proteins as intrinsically disordered and you know with into like those using those missing coordinates because they tend to be a good reflection of the lack of crystal structure and therefore a high possibility of disorder so the direct and encoding is that you don't find in index like a structure on the database so my good know that so little bit so it would come to my magnet so give me just a few minutes and it comes up I need to remember so our search is a cross section of the x-rays oh so it's a I think it's Drake or sectional structure well I would such a very quickly so if I remember by the end of the talk okay that's so those are the really effective what we end up doing from this sample we use only hot loops and remark 46 because they tend to give less false cities then called schools gives a high positive rate Oh probably are known to be crystallized but I still consider disorder and of course we used a the only recording that we know that it works on silicon Robo so are you please come to take a quick addendum today didn't stop to ask they know so they calculate from the from the minnow seat instructions so and then they have a Newton algorithm that is based as well from from a calculation of the energy based on unknown crystalline structures that they have so you practice is a numeral based approach so we can go through the details because they were running out of time and I have two and one I have a 115 I have a meeting so let me just give you an example of how they are going is work so in case that you haven't used one so if you take a protein that's saying so I'm taking an enzyme because of course I mean subjectively weak for enzymes so do you take like so I say and essentially you run the day I'll go team so if you run they're going to give you first each individual resolute it would do a calculation of the of the protein disorder for that ratio and then you have attraction to determine whether you are above or below the attraction of what the algorithm considered to be a disorder recipient so if you don't cross the threshold for example here you have a blue lining here and this graph is not perfect enough for you guys for that so only those are above the blue line so if you have it look good on the blue line those are the texture that these domains in here they're considered it's order if the green light that's a maximal Thresh will appear below there you will consider any of those residues to be disorder he said when you cross the threshold on a niche structural nine for each other in is different depending of how they're on their calculations so what we said we we decide to take each one of the items then measure the threshold line and see what were the percentage of ratios that we will have a disorder and you know this is what it would look like if you do that example algorithms and this is what it would look like if you use they are you pray and you pray for example in this case the treasure is around fifty percent so we are not on the treasure of fifty percent then anything that is below leap is considered an order recipe so it's a pretty straightforward approach so while we certainly take those algorithms and then we didn't trust that they always good when you run in the whole protein they could give you a normal distributed PDF so what we listen we decide to do and nonparametric analysis so that when we calculate a unique distribution for each one of the proteins we're doing our analysis and then once we have the probability density function of course we could calculate mean median percentiles and assess that expression of the institution and you know the algorithm was pretty step over to run so what we Lisa then we took each one whole proteome took the three algorithms we wanted to Stoli so the top one is there you prep the second one is that the sample hot loops and then the final one is going to be the dissemble brain and you know when you when you look at this so this is a percent of this so that you will find in each one whole programs and now that you look at the percentage of total proteins are considered extorter so they saw the loop of the proteome so it seems to me on average we know 20% of the total prototype proteome is disorder which is such the same number so nobody has those I think before we didn't know within across protein so we have then of course the boxes are determining where the median they mean and then the 75% are we did the same thing with the following thing so the longest continuous disorder domain that as I told you that's considered a standard measurement for this for this order and if it's about 13 messages then you would consider a protein very disorder now look at the numbers so usually will algebraic so all proteins would be concealed disorder in the protein because you can see that most of the protein and that's the 25 5 percentile boxes in there so you can see that all the protein would be effectively this or that we use you because you know you have more than 30 continues races which are this or if you use a hot loops or use the right I'll going so the number said they go slightly no but a still 30 is a number that it seems to be around the mean and this one in here is very low so this idea of having 30 cathedrals in Lin to measure this order is now completely debunked in the moment we have under statistics and in fact if I could be doing the statistics what I want to make sure is that if I have a highly disordered protein should be somewhere around those outside the box well below you know the regular percentage because that's the point where a good know if a protein is a number like so when we say somebody stone we don't say that somebody's told because its own it's an average person we say that somebody stone because on average 75% of course we have to look up to see that person and ask so that's the way you know I wanted to definition and you really think we have Mike and I were we're doing the deck story is that this is not actually standardized by the length of the protein so 13 residues on a protein length of 50 residents more than 50% on protein what happen if you have a protein that has a thousand residues it's not significant they would create a new index that actually looks at the longest continuous or the percentage that is actually based on the length I know now that we find out that this when he said essentially standardized that that continues longer deceive you and then you divide by the total length of the protein then we find that the average is well below 20% which makes sense so you tend to have a smaller portion of the total protein to be pretty pretty low and you know those are Giga the whole recipe but let me show you a 36 now so this is a study that we find out and you said to look for example at the longest continuous residues so this is a normal you have to look for the 16 depending of the algorithm you're employing if he's our you pair with one of the two the example arguing or nope so for that one so do you find out for example for how you prep rarely therapy irresolute its consider the highly disorder because this is the average value and you can see that the average value is 59 so then if you look at for example hot dogs is 37 if you look at their rallies to anyone so it's not it's just been about them in so a 30 number contact oh very important depending on the organism where you are for example if you look at Drosophila Drosophila tends to have more highly disordered proteins at least with when you use on your plate than when you are using for example the worm the discs are OTO so you look at human so humans as well they they look 70 which is more higher than the gift so sorry Mouse human there is 60 in here so then you have so the mouse near 70 so numbers are all dependent from trick factor so depending from first the factor of the proteome your employee secondly they use in the disorder with whump a protein in both another depending on the algorithm and then they'll want to be dependent of a measurement you are going to be using whether you're going to be using the protein disorder they call the longest continuous length the longest continuous Lele standardized by the whole protein or when another measure that we define in this paper so there is single unique definition what you have to use is this over all the finishes and they do comparison which is then what we decide to do with with protein Atlas so how this colony to in the brahim center so if Scott is a really fantastic guy so he has been exposing for a number of years this protein click 16 take 16 so the loss of click 16 in patriotic eyelets leads to impaired glucose on your classes and you know glucose I stimulate insulin secretion you know click 16 seems to be playing an important role in in the mitochondrial metabolism and I was in that Scott disco bass that when he put click 16 of one of this the motors that calculate protein disorder he saw you know it looks to be highly this sort of a problem and he call it an intrinsically disordered protein and when he approached my group he told me you know I have an intrinsic it's all that protein it's really exciting and I think intrinsically sorted is in kind of important you have my doubts what he was telling me this because I have seen so many people in the past would you know they feel Inc an important because it is covered and intrinsically sorted protein that I wanted to figure out if he was right and you know the way that we did so he has decide politics at the Plex extinct the intrinsically is further the region it's important for the regulation in glucose and me topic and then we have a couple of years for West Olympics and in in our case is not because intrinsically this other region in the protein is fundamental for the binding it's fundamental because it's separated in two regions which are highly structured and it allows flexibility with those two would you tell intrinsically soul the flexibility is appear to another binding so that's how we're currently hypothesis but disorder plays an important role separate in those two regions where effectively the same for they binding the traditional binding mr. core and you're ready we run the analysis so we said you know let's just take existing in the maps then look at the mouse proteome do they comparison way in a stats with respect to the market and we're going to look at click 16 so it doesn't contain a highly you motion number of this order residence this is their you prep these hot blobs this is the Riemann 465 these are the distributions of the entire Mouse proteome and if you look where they the median the mean they're sitting down well click it click 16 is sitting down so click 16 you sitting down there around 30 which is very close to the expected value son average protein when you look at the total number of ratios and it's a large electronic not only for you prep it's an average protein for upload it's an average protein for remark for 65 and you can look here it's and the number where it stands so it expands there around sixty percent of the entire population this is really more disorder than the average protic no and not with hot loops is going below for the Rhema 6465 is this valuable but you know it's very close to the average 65 percent like we don't say that that person is told if it's only 65 percent you know almost allergy well you know what happens the following scene so we can really sit with the other measurements with it and what we find out is click 16 that is so Dex highly organized because when you look at the longest continuous domain of click 16 it stands by itself with respect to the older code longest continuous domains in the rest of the proteome so when you look at the distribution on the longest continuous domains with al you prep the hot loops and the rim at 64 65 these are the distributions I'm showing there they meet the median and the mean and look where you have a click 16 is in the only 89 percentage of the 90 percentile of the population when you look into ha blocks is on the 97th percentile and will be look into remark 465 is in the 92% so it's an anomalous protein in the moment you see that with respect to the population then you are seeing the really high toll basketball player you have to do Pope so the something unique here with respect to little population and that's what we learned so but the longest continuous domain is literally important and it's unique with respect to the rest of the proteome and that's what I would goal by annual standard definition and intrinsically disordered domain because you know is well above the mean and on the top 10 percentile of a population you know how you can use this order Aetna so essentially we put this on an algorithm can do that automatically for you and you don't miss a description of what happened with wait like 16 whatever means are or what we do this as we put this or that which is actually some web service that allows you to do effectively two things do you know do you want to know that statistics about the protein so we have the ten proteins that we we did the calculations there and it will tell you whether they means one of the standard deviations how the distributions would look like what are they both on 25 percentile top 25 percentile they both on 10 percent and the top 10 percent so that when you do a prediction it gives you an idea where you're standing but the only thing that it does is that if you have a protein of interest it could be one that is already on any of the databases you can call the I you they they are you proud number and essentially could run the analysis for you and comparing with the proteome but you can all load your own sequence and then do the analysis and I can show you very quickly how it works I think it was pretty well designed by my life and I'm very proud of the work we did so let's just open a browser so if you take this order together it would bring you to this order you meet no TV you and essentially it would bring you to a panel where you have three options so let me know so you you can analyze a protein of interest that is what we have in here you can search for a specific protein feature but essentially you can browse the disorder in the proteins you know let's assume that we want to use the pro teams and it's upload there and then you decide well let me just look at the proteome of human and then when you submit it it's going to give you all the statistics and distribution for the human proteome and effectively you have you know the numbers of when we did the last accession so remember that is that we have noticed and they grow so we use for the statistical assessment then you can display the proteome concern the proteome discussions will give you the extra bution for each one of the observer and ingredients all the consensus between all the asses are common between each one of the other predictors it would give you a percentage we understand it would give you a table as well with this animation tonight we could give you very expected value and that would be so then we have the continued lambdas domain and we have as well the distributions where the percentiles and the number of ratios that you require to her and they we can have as well the balance that that lend Escondido refused that is actually - - I whole protein we have as well the statistics in there with all the testing so I'll tell you what you've done so if you don't like if you like to analyze on a specific protein you have I think I put the protein sequence of like sixth inning here so we can analyze a protein of interest you can do it by the ID you need Parata ID and you can do it by the sequence so if you have you're putting in here so let me just duplex extinct in here so we go back to the browser go get in and then you set up your over the lesson and you in this case as your select they are lesson when a protein sickness was taken and then when we would give you the the analysis and universities that some of this total disorder algorithms they can give ideal predictions depending of the size of the protein so moving the temptu accession where the position don't become effective and you know we'll give you a Roman message of what would happen if you exceed the number of amino acids well the argues that you should be using and the measurement that we Kosar more objective well so well see that would do is that you would give you all the slices about the protein shall I tell you the protein length so the territory has been analyzed it will give mean either so it would give you this basically a dropping so the fraction of charged messages the nurtured per se the prowling contain and the Kappa which are measures that people you've it will give you the disorder and other promoting and it would make those it will give you a charges where they are that's for the reporting it would show you the propensities or what they look like and where the attractions are so they for the protein it can show you this other content as well so we figures the distributions and weighed your stand under it would summarize the statistics as well and then we will give you a semi statistics for the longest continuous domain show where your stomach I showed you before in the presentation and we have had a consensus your data Texas I didn't on the consensus of course as well it gives you high value so you are in the percentile of 69 percent on the consensus and then finally we will give you as well the longest continuous or the radio by the percentage of length and in this case if you look at the numbers I will show you those so you based on the length is not done a numbers so the proteins close today to average values and then we can videos with the summary of all the results of what we have you find out the older cases and you know even you can copy them the Feebles tecnine so it gives you options of exporting the figures in the system so you can load a the image if you want to have a presentation it's a pretty nice tool and the choice that we have is that we want to get it published well you know we need to increase significantly the number of proteins we have in there so ten protein of nowadays is consider like a grain of salt in the number of products which are available and the other systems we need to increase us will the number of oh oh I'll go inside panic disorder and that's where you know even though we don't feel any challenge of the power element proteins and doing the analysis we are finding challenging to actually get the algorithms installing in our local service and actually running and because most of them there are no open access so we have few of them that you can find in the literature and some of them we haven't chosen because we don't consider they're pretty reliable when they come into the predictions is difficult to get those are more consider the most regular from the physical chemical point of view get me out of so agree to give in to us but also always done so if somebody would like to work on this if they only all mix inclined topic that we have in my laboratory there was a very mathematical inclined so by form at least in my experience they don't like the rest of the work we tend to do because it's heavily mathematically inclined for the thesis something that is more within the lines of what most of the PhDs and they might format explore and they do and we if you have any questions or comments I'll be more than glad to answer them out you first so there are already publicly available in a place when is this mode one is one small oh yes so different from those those I just give you this other numbers and they're not set up in any context so and you know what the challenge that we have with for example with some of these large databases of protein disorder is that they have even calculated the protein disorder with proteins that they their existence either questionable or they have races which are not fully define and the elegance can give solutions to that because they have ways to come across on well for example there's an algorithm thing is remember which one of these what is one of the solutions that if you have a known define amino acid you put X as an amino acid you can essentially drink the protein and reduce if you have ten amino acid which are undefined would drink it by ten Resolute's and then it was a calculation with a protein that actually is effectively different from the from the original protein but you know what you find in the literature you find any signal housing a standardized a statistic old protein just find pure reporting that husband hasn't been clean operates so that's where I have notice the difference based on predictions which are not directly derived from experiments have no experimental verification up yes well this is what happens with most of the protein they saw the algorithms they are just predicted and again so you know the challenge with protein disorder is an increase difficult field to work on because the definition of what a protein disorder is is the lack that we have an experiment that proves I disorder is the life that it has a protein so it's a very awkward they finish on the societal nature article that was published a few days ago on how conservation the definition is because the contravention that lacks of physical evidence you are this order because well you know we cannot kissed a nice you or your disorder because yourself multiple confer you configuration were not entirely sure if it's a result of flexibility on reality or intrinsically disorder and you know that's a challenge with with this problem itself but because the phoenicians is widely used is and you know I go to a story sessions and people talk about disorder like if something that is physically that you can touch touch and the way they know that is something physically that touches because they use these aliens or doing the predictions if we're using the algorithms I think they should be used in a standardized manner to give you objectively information what it means to be disorder it's awkwar-- firm are smart enough to find the right become something and then somehow energy state give up on that high entropy state exactly so okay that I can happen although there are some proteins I do they have lower the energy as much as they can and they know was free mean yes they they still up sir and you know only part of a protein can crystallize and then there these sections are very very flexible are they trying to be regions also this issue from or selected or conserved there's some which I concern the reason they're conserved they're people who have multiple hypotheses of evolutionary of for example the implant science people claim that this the protests are equally important the seed phase because essentially they would give volume to protect the the embryo while is developing OS on this finally state that is not growing and there are people who actually as well clean that the other exceeds because you need to keep separately to all the regions and he has that that function so they have exist and they have a born with potentially having these high entropy eight states to allow order to exist but whether the case is highly controversial in the case of the defenders of the theory of protein this is all a key dunker and blame IAM or bisque in they clean the disorder itself as a function the flexibility has a function by itself and they say that the rediscovery of protein disorder has breakdown this key and not mechanism of a protein function actually works therefore the word native state is actually inaccurate at native state exactly like you always go with a lock the world hacked Bambara Gonzalez is a challenge within the feeling Center and you know there even the biochemical you know if you talk to the old protein this so they would work out salute you have really we were talking about because nobody goes and I don't expect you as a scientist when others they take it very seriously and I think now there's most of people take an Israeli seriously because their algo is have been proven to be relatively good predictors up to this point so since you're using multiple tools to sort of generate your result say you've got contradictory information from two separate methods how would you go about resolving that  how would you interpret that result which do you trust more to get it right than the other well do in our case so the guidance was able opener we have developed their unique for each one of the items so and you have to take it within the algorithm itself we try to call with these consensus of ratios which are which are common and you know that's one way that we have final two to resolve the potential contradictions material each algorithm would have a unique way to define intrinsically disordered domains of proteins what you have to do is trust whether that definition has been set in the algorithm beforehand he makes sense and again because they're more than 50 algorithms there's some of them that are rarely used have been developed by one group and it's only the group and their friends who actually are using it when all that are slightly more accepted by beginner scientific public's and it's difficult to know which one is the right one and if there are contraction between them that's why I think they - exists because if you look at work areas across proteins so far there is a common trend so when one when you find that we have a score that when we analyze a protein if the protein tends to be this shoulder with one of the algorithms the other I'll go instead to predict the same thing it's not exactly on the same percentile but it tends to be above the average when when we find it out it's not going to be on there 90 top on the tank top percentile of a population might be on the seventh or the 25% top of the population but you would still across the various other algorithms they tends to be some consistency at least we think what's up with having a choice over that what is the magnitude correlation coefficient between implant and this then nobody has a story up so it's an egg analysis tool open and again is difficult to study because very few people allow you to use an algorithm systematically to do proteomic analysis now I have the data but only for three and you know with three you know the analysis shouldn't be I don't think it's going to be sufficiently solid we have components for example with the simple answer is they it tends to be a correlation between their results they are more closely correlated than the results with I you play and you can see that based on the on the distribution so if you look at the distributions and we have wrong made us go back to the presentation so when you look at the exterior shows so you can see up for example hope loops that end always tends to have you know like a more normal type distribution well then they operate and the reflux they tend to be more similar so there's a stronger correlations between these two and this and and when you look at so we have the whole looks and the loops those two correlate very well between each other and it's the way they define this order themselves ask questions
