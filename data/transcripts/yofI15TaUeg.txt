recently I didn't realize in today director computational oncology and bioinformatics that sage bionetworks and Justin claim as electrical engineer before that and also he start a company he was the co-founder for five site technologies in 1999 to 2005 so he has amazing resume and experience and thank you so much for coming I'm looking for all right well thank you very much indica I think reduction and invitation and thank you and in this talk yeah the name of this talk is actually chain if you see it was previously called the consensus of that colorectal cancer I promise I'll be talking about that but I decided to go ahead and generalize the talk to a broader crowd and to also introduce sage by our network many of you may not have heard of us although those who've been are the green competition should hopefully know as well I know there's some audience who are stellar participants so we're very glad that you're here and that you participate and I'm hoping many others will participate in some of the future challenges we have to offer so as India said I had the computational oncology group at Sage we have other disciplines that we cover well outside of oncology I'll be talking about so we're located in Seattle beautiful Seattle here and we're located in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research building yes there's a global warming's improving the weather in Seattle and we've been there since 2009 we were founded it doesn't buy this film in here Stephen friend and the mission of this organization was to provide tools and environments that help improve reproducibility and collaboration and biomedical research and not only do we build the tools but we eat around dogs really have to do the research ourselves and the goal is to really kind of shake up that as Stephen would call it the biomedical industrial complex and think about different forms and which collaborations and incentives and patient engagement can occur and so a lot of our efforts are with that motivation although you'll see that some of our work is also quite traditional and research base as well we as I said we have tools this is one of our tools called synapse is the data platform for collaboration and data sharing this is just an example from our colorectal consortium and the provenance graph of how this data was generated I'm not going to I'm not here to sell synapse I just to let you know about it and here are the number of consortium and projects were involved in spanning progenitor stem cells dream challenges influenza what part of the TCGA pan-cancer effort as well as ICGC a large number of year or degenerative projects and then equipment you know oncology efforts as well so I'm going to before I go into the research focus of this talk I want to just share a couple of interesting side projects that I've been part of that are kind of interesting and a bit unorthodox so this is work we published recently it was the title here social interactions for enabling research communities and the idea of this so Frank McCormick he was the AEC our president two years ago they agree shorter than that in Steven we're talking but now let's let's take advantage of the fact that you're President and do something a little different at its ACR and they said well what we have all these abstracts that people have submitted why don't we do some kind of interesting text binding exercise when we can try to find interest in relationships well ACR gave us all these abstracts I did some fairly rudimentary text mining to build this social interactive and and let me let me add that this is only done for people who are doing research on grass they didn't do it ACR why that's big abstract we just concentrated on people doing research on grass and then we sent out a number of survey questions to these same set of researchers to understand like what are the major questions in their field what are the unresolved problem where is the controversy where is it too much research which they're too little and so between this interactive and the survey we led a special session at ACR 2013 2014 and and it worked out quite well ACR liked it so much and there are such engagement in the group in a big ballroom in standard they said we want to do this every year now we're going to do this this upcoming you see our conference this time it's going to be on Nick but there's any Nick researchers here I hope you can attend we're gonna move on from rats this is a kind of fun project and I'll let me add a couple words about the dream challenge as I know most of you know about this if you don't so between challenges are now merged with sage bionetworks good one in the thing and the goal is to create an open crowd-sourced competition to engage the community engage people outside the biomedical engage in electro engineers computer scientists and so look at hard problems and biomedical research that can be quantitatively score it is a competition when we have to find a winner so we have to have the right kind of aid in the right setting and so this is recently what we concluded we've had this is the last round that we've had competition Alzheimer's the gene essentially Sankey ality prediction that's trying to predict synthetic lethal using genomics we've had the somatic mutation calling challenge variant calling this was led by Paul Peterson MICR and Santa Cruz and also one in AML I want to give a quick trigger it's very it's very date it's very challenge dependent so so for example in the somatic mutation calling it very challenging what is the true gold snake so they had they had a simulation data set so they had Paul Boutros lab he's able to generate synthetic genome add specific mutations to it and so that's one goal Stan but of course some simulations are never very satisfactory they did obtain five-wheel samples and have very high depth sequencing to generate instead of what they could consider real and if for example in AML this would be where you withhold they said of patient outcome is known release some data where people can train and then they taste test on so very very kind of standard machine learning scenario but what we do is we take the validation out of the hands of you all not that can't be trusted but there's always this question you know how do you how do you objectively score people's prediction and and how do you do so in a way where you don't fool yourself it's very easy I mean machine learner myself I I very often convince myself that I have to have the best algorithm and the best model and lo and behold I have over fit so it's very easy to fool yourself and so we set up these in a way that tries to overcome looking forward here's the next round of challenges will have in the next next few months so continuing on the somatic mutation calling challenge there's one now on tumor heterogeneity and evolution one on RNA and just looking at fusion detection and then this is one that I'm going to be leading this is the prostate cancer dream challenge a little more on that so this this is structured to predict two things outcome in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with first-line docetaxel so to predict overall survival and to predict treatment it's continuation and the data comes from for pharmaceuticals who opened up their their data sets to us where they're giving us the comparative arms of their trials with both trials in total has 1500 patients in the training set about 500 patients in the validation set and we have as lined up as incentives we have a partnership with nature biotech reviewed the paper final manuscript prize money and and so here's an interesting this is new for this year so who's familiar with AJCC okay so there's no clinicians in the through okay you're listening you might you would probably know HACC it's the American Joint Committee on cancer and they define the TNM staging then you go in and your stages stage 1 or stage 2 so you know the criteria for your staging a novice and and really what it measures is the extent of disease burden what agency to really define and this year for their eighth edition they want to include they want to expand their domain to looking at prognostic models more broadly they want to have a suite of calculator consents and these go directly into the hands of clinicians so one of the things that we've always kind of wanted with the great challenges is to have an application where where the model can move directly into a translatable environment into the clinic where it actually has so here we think we found an opportunity where a JCCC has likes to review any top laners that come out of this and then get this translated into a calculator that could be deployed for all physicians to use when they're staging their patients so if they're exciting and this is obviously be for patients and I'm just real quickly some other areas that were active in oncology neurofibromatosis wanted to take one and two TCGA pan-cancer efforts will preparing another dream challenge to predict drug synergy and it's good AstraZeneca we're working with AML labs where there's ex vivo screening and omics to predict patient response image analysis and getting more interested in mobile insensitive so that's kind of a quick overview so now I want to talk about yeah when they need more validation before they actually start applying it in the clinic sure yes yeah I kind of obscured that so there's there's a whole process that in fact I'm part of what's called the precision medicine core that's a AJCC committee that is basically all kind of a lot of the biostatisticians who get in the room and say what's the level of evidence required and we also interact with position the surgeon themselves colleges etc who finally come to consensus of what a real prognostic model should be what's the very conservative group so the level of evidence is actually quite high for them to actually endorse um now so there's so this is kind of the first stage there is a set of data sets that are owned by co-operative groups another that we could also use for further validation but it's at least the first step that it will recognize this model now we'll apply it to the operative group data trial data and there as well and again yeah yeah and there's there's two trials or the enthuse trial it's over 2,000 patients so we couldn't we couldn't get access to it for the for the competition but we'll have access to it private to further validate model so yeah I don't mean to suggest that it's a kind of a rubber-stamp into a HACC and at the same time this is where so this is in kind of parallel to the TNM staging that's that's really kind of sacrosanct and and and that's not going to change so much but now they're going to have it kind of in parallel these separate calculators and because it's the first time I think it's going to be there it's going to be beta and the latians will look at this they'll evaluate success - how good these are but you know whether they get used in a clinic in a real way were made okay so here's a kind of go briefly through this through this through this project here I included it now because the indicator the part of it we have many discussions about aging and what it means to have biological aging versus chronological age but this work was completed a couple years ago so we wanted to look at this this phenomenon chronologically biological aging because we believe it exists so here we have a Sean Connery who you think graceful ager and then you have others who through the same courses time seem to have accelerated aging so there's sure correct but it does beg the question you have chronology which doesn't change that time is constant but biological aging may have undergo shifts so question is there there such thing as a differential aging rate so we looked at this question we obtained 488 individuals who had with whole blood and put them on methylation arrays and I should add that this was that this data came from an aborted study looking at something else they wanted to look at macular degeneration I think lately confounded the way they did this profiling so well we have all this methylation rates what are we gonna do with it so it gave it to us and said let's just study aging and this was shortly after Illumina came out with their 450k Peter aid so we had a we had this data we had a profound in 450k we had a lot of demographic information age and some other covariance and we also obtained some convenient types and when you look at the distribution of all the methylome here it's kind of bimodal so you either kind of hyper methylated or hyper methylated here's the age distribution when you look at pure correlation with the marker by marker with age you find there's a lot of CPGs that are both positively negative building a totally correlated with so given that we saw that they were signal here that well let's just build a model that can predict one's age based on just the methylation profile not the computer you use but we did and the dependent variable is their actual age and independent variables where all the CPG 450k well and and use the elastic net penalize regression model to fit the whole thing and this is what we observed we actually observed that you can predict age quite precisely just using the methalone so here's here's their first cohort that we trained in and this and what you're seeing here is the cross-validation result it's not validating on the same samples that we're training on and we observe that we observe a really strong correlation and RMS and you 3.8 two years we did obtain a secondary cohort of a hundred eighty patient sample and and and it see that we can recapitulate this model quite well so we thought we had what was in fact a model biological aging with the assumption that on average people are going to follow their chronological age it's the deviation from this fit where you see either accelerated aging above the line or slower aging well we had that we didn't have a prediction yeah no sure yeah it's amazing how accurately it does follow but it becomes circular if you try to second-guess you know how far it should be because we don't really know because the concept of biological aging itself define but they try to answer that question like so we yet we didn't look at what worked well but the model was based on 67 markers most of the markers we found were disease related or involved in processes that are associated with aging DNA damage Alzheimer's oxidative stress here's one interesting gene that had a very high coefficient to the model and also to Kayla 14 which is the master regulator know be involved in the decent metabolic rate so we did have some patient demographics we asked does this differential is accelerated or decelerated aging is that correlated with any other covariant so we where we found that the greatest signals in fact that males and females had differential aging rates males showing a higher acceleration than females and just reject her that maybe this explains why women have we did look at other areas as well diabetes smoking BMI and and we were hoping that one of these might be associated with the coloration we also looked at that the ptl's and those that would perhaps could explain accelerated aging well as well we found some interesting candidates that we validated that and so following our publication shoot out just a few months later even more about that at UCLA and not with this paper here a very extensive various in fact you use the same model we had last met rained it on methylation and chronology so very coincidentally they're very similar study but he looked more broadly at other key to type in found that this model can be recapitulated in other tissues as well and and then he was able to actually do the study that we wanted to show that the disease phenotype correlated with accelerated aging and he was able to observe this in the liver and found that obesity was associated with his higher acceleration so it's nonlinear at younger than 20 years of age so it's very linear come 20 upward but but there's a nonlinear transformation one has to do when you're looking for local oh yes you observe that as well I don't know enough to comment but I do believe that what that there is kind of this accelerated aging process that occurs in your younger and then levels out so now you can go to Wikipedia and there's even a whole concept of etchant epigenetic lock in a declaration age and so it's so the cost of the biological aging of course because it's a Wikipedia it must mean it's true that there is this this concept and we haven't done any more work on this since but I think it's very interesting we yeah we don't have that kind of data we did look at cancer so we took our model quite at the TCGA first to the normal so we can look at the different tissues and found that in general we found a fairly good concordance of the aging TCGA and what we predict but with a bit of a shift and then when you good-looking cancer you tend to things get very very complicated very quickly I can call in cancer because of microsatellite instability and very strong changes it becomes harder to use as evidence and accelerate the aging because there's so many other variables that are now change but so the cancer might be the wrong place to neatly doubt it and and yeah and then this data says when they come available I think it's not a whole lot this is the only this is the only study I've seen that's actually look good okay so this one this work was done with three I decreed group in UC San Diego and Lumina was also a partner in this okay so now I want to move it to the what I promised before which was the colon cancer and it's of course of a cliche to say that cancer is head or G we all know that but there's different areas of heterogeneity that we can explore and so I'm going to talk about these three areas here a global molecular pattern its subtyping there's a pathway heterogeneity and then there's also Claude not and I'm going to address these in the kind of three vignettes for the colorectal cancer consortium is one where Lee looked at the global molecular heterogeneity wrath modeling work that we did and then some future work that we're doing with a jzz ok so let's move on to the colorectal cancer consortium as I said cancer in general and certain colorectal is a heterogeneous disease over the last couple years many independent groups have reported on molecular subtyping and each group has a kind of described their own biology or interpretation to their subtypes but what's not clear is is there a concordance among others that is they're actually agreement and the what people are ascribing to the biology and so here's the here's some of the papers that have been published in the last couple years and when you try to map all these different subtypes this is what it looks like so you have TCG at top and here you had six groups and some say there's three subtypes other groups say there's five subtypes four six and we know that subtyping there's no gold standard how do you how do you say how many subtypes that really are depends on your a threshold thing and what's your evidence for truncate your clustering tree so we know that there's expected heterogeneity but is there a way forward beyond this mess and is there a way for us to make a very strong statement about what are the definitive colorectal subtypes so what we did we formed the consortium among all the groups that you just saw and they were committed to share all respective datasets whether they have them in-house or the theory public in a sense and we were going to compare and validate all the existing classification platform we're going to then conduct an integrative analysis across the pooled data sets and then define the clinical molecular hallmark of the subtype and most importantly we wanted this to be a an example for all future subtyping efforts because there's many people who are doing this many people publishing but subtyping doesn't really find its way beyond the the researcher doesn't find its way into the clinic and I think a lot of that is because there's there's no good mechanism for defining a robust consensus that actually so this is the first time that we've kind of seen this effort come together like this so here's - the the diagram describing how it operated here the six groups that participated sage was the the kind of you were Switzerland we were the independent group that and recall these are all the competitors they've all published and they're all trying to play against each other but they needed a neutral party like say she doesn't have our own classifier we brought all the data together normalize it in one consistent way so that we were looking at differences there and that all the groups applied their algorithm to do all the pooled samples we developed a method to identify the consensus subtyping if there was one in the datasets from that we built a classifier and then did all the characterization downstream interpret interpretation of the subjects so here's the datasets we were able to fool over 4,500 samples across fresh frozen and method PE metric RNA sequencing actually a lot of public proprietary data sets and only when I get it the TCGA well we didn't use place I performed we are studying that's an ongoing work we're we're we're looking at the icing form differently to crossing subjects that's not the this is distributed across all stages but primarily stage two and three and one might expect and same distribution with respect to microsatellite instability they also had follow-up data from samples as well so this is kind of how you without thought about how you define a consensus subtype basically just looking for common patterns across all the six group so if you've seen a common pattern here we might call that consensus molecular subtype one another pattern we call it two if we didn't see any pattern we called unclassified and to identify these clusters we used to get a random walk on a graph where we that was created across all these all these subtypes all the samples he tells there but when we run this algorithm with many bootstraps and trying to be robust as we can this is what we observed and so each of these bubbles represents a subtype from a particular group and and what this told us is that there were four robust subtype that emerged and you looked across all these and here's another way of observing that here thinks you could see this one and you kind of common color across the groups that define different subjects they all have different number of sub their own subtypes across the groups but you start to see how there's a common pattern across here and of course there were a number samples at - that didn't show any concordance at all and we just called these young classified and this was about twenty percent of the samples that remained unclassified here's another way of looking at this in kind of network space where we can each dot represents a patient and we can cluster this in a way that again allows you to see and simply color these pushes according to our subtyping subtyping and many - unclassified fall in between you these subtypes as you might expect is just another way to visualize that you simply load the data inside escape and let it okay so now that we have this consensus subtype and we also built the classifier where we took 20 percent and we're unclassified our classifier was able to reclassify half of those so now at the end of the day we only have two so now we want so now it comes to interpretability we have this subject what do they need so we had all this demographic and clinical information other than molecular information so we just started doing very very basic statistic differential we find CMS one is more enriched or for older patients and it's also enriched for females and CMS for is slightly enriched for Stage four in CMS one we've seen it's enriched for the right side of the colon and also CMS one's enriched for the microsatellite instability you see this one again they also see be wrapped in Richmond and we know that B reputation and NSI status awfully early and here we see that K wrasse mutation is an omission in CMS three we did a lot of correlative analysis with all the different kind of Olmec data available especially with TCGA in the copy number bility someone's almost ability since status many mutation that would occur the copy number methylation micro RNA and then the recent protium dated and it's published nature about a year ago well I'm not going to get into this specific result I think the main interpret interpret ability of the subtypes comes here when you do pathway so here we see in CMS to CMS to is is kind of the canonical this is the Burton Goldstein model of colon cancer waned activation nickk nickk activation CMS for is the mesenchymal phenotype will be CT via data activation matrix for modeling stromal infiltration see that's one we also see jak-stat earlier film activation or only see vegetarian CMS one we see immune infiltration and so semen if three was always kind of this question mark what if CNS three they notice an American Fork a ratification and so here we really see this is where it really became obvious what CMS three high metabolic activity so this really allowed us to characterize this in a way that it hadn't been for before we did Bible analysis units for this is nothing Kimmel has a much worse outcome than the other three subtypes and this was true even with multi variable analysis accounting for vacations and MSI status age and other demographic information salsa Tina sports also much worse outcome would be survival and so this this was very interesting when we look at survival after we've a so after give a primary that come back and you see that here CMS for has a much worse outcome than CMS two and then cs3 and cs4 I think I'm on the bit about are kind of in the middle of it so again something very unexpected that came out of yes this is the CMS one so this is the the Indian infiltration and it's I I class so yes I mean that's a that's a good point so that's actually we don't believe the primary change is much but the question is when you look at the metastatic site through that change and that's that's actually what we're looking at now that's ongoing work so here here we are with what we call the the taxonomy of colorectal cancer CMS one is then it's Lyonya Encinas to canonical unit three metabolic and bussiness formats in criminal and so this is the this is their the this is the taxonomy that the expert group has agreed on and what we hope will be the future basis for patient stratification in financial trial that we're already working with a couple few companies pharmaceuticals who are deploying so yeah so so APC is you can't believe to be an earlier event in so it's down and over 70% and we looked and we didn't really define any kind of strong association there same with pi3 kinase it tends to co-occur with chaos so one might argue that scene s3 has a slight enriched with p53 oh yeah also with frequently that we didn't see so that's so that's kind of represents the body work that's complete and now under review ongoing work is really how do we how do we make this useful you subtype to run and make them useful we have to find out how they associate with treatment or patient response patient-derived xenograft is one area that a lot of activity on so we wanted to look at whether whether they see in a subtype but we could picture late in the pd x model if you just take so this is this is a patient and so here we have in blue are the primary tumor and here in red are the pd x arrived from these primary feelers and you see when you cluster them this is gene expression data they immediately separate so there's a very obviously very strong difference in the pd x and the primary tumor but the question is would we take our CMS gene that are used in our model question is what how does that affected when you go from p DX from cumulative pd x and by and large for the different for the CMS one two and three you see that the the the important genes shown in red dented fender to correlate across these tumor in the p DX is CMS four which is the mesenchymal with stromal infiltrated subtype well we see that there's actually a loss of that s Coloma here in the pd x model and there's going to be actually really interesting paper coming out an extra genetic soon which shows that the the p DX it's the mouse if you take the RNA seek and then you now align to the mouse genome you can actually find a lot of the stromal genes we described and could act as a substitute for the stroma yeah so if you if you so if you go back here and you basically remove the the major effects the ping PDF could you regress and pick up residuals of between the PDX and you do and we do this clustering the PDX and the primary pairs pair up yeah so that that's still preserved and eat down here so what is the question like different passages of the kick oh I see interesting um no I don't think that in the I'm not on any percent sure but I'm pretty i I don't believe for the person who did a lot I think they commented that there was not absolutely found that all CNS types were represented there once you look you accounted for this loss of seroma done more or less in the papers okay so I think I'm to run through some of the last modeling we've done this is that the pathway level now looking at heterogeneity although Michael cancer and the idea here is that so then we like to think that you have an aberration you have the last mutation if the bracken mutation then that pathway is somehow activated in a very discreet way in a bimodal way whether it's either on or off but we know that there's a lot of modulators of a pathway that can either attenuate or more active so there's this concept of Rassman raggedness pi3 kinase right so it's this idea that that it's not really discrete but it is continuous and if you look at if you if you try to find surrogates for the paths of activity and you'll be more you'll be richer in information and if you just look at the aberrational so we believe this as well and this so our idea was that in in colon cancer that the canonical mutation of KS 12 their codon : 13 is the is the most canonical way of thinking about oxidation but that there can be other aberrations that may enhance or mitigate activity this pathway so we wanted to develop a quantitative readout of rasmus and and people have done this before but not in colorectal cancer so there's Raths signature develop mostly in lung and so we took those and we and we asked how what are they how what did they do in being able to differentiate here wild-type sample and they actually didn't do that well so this led us to develop our own model where here we trained so similar to the methylation and the Asian process where we we want to develop a predictive model that can predict K rs.12 and third communication using gene expression data and we had creation 20 samples to train ahmad along and and we ended up with it with a fairly robust robust model so here we trained it and here's the validation data set we trained it we tested it on so here's the area under the ROC curve so pretty pretty good accuracy we then asked how long did this model do on other diseases that have quickly clear application like on lung adenocarcinoma a you see not nearly as good showing that this is very colorectal specific [Music] then we wanted to ask now that we have this quantitative of rass activity so how does this compare with when you look at the different variants of last mutation in colon cancer we are able to do this with TCGA so here's our last index scores Errol is low grass activity one is iris activity and so here we're able to plot all the samples in the colon cancer TCGA dataset here early variants came ask you blue is Iraq and here in yellow in Wrath well not necessarily there is your suggestion that that 13d mutations are not as potent so perhaps they meet so this yeah I don't think strong evidence that less rax activity eg 30 Andy but we see that there is an interesting distribution certainly b-raf if they have a lower graph activation and resse has very comparable to K rats and we see some some very rare mutations here these are only n of one but it may indicate that these are not actually activators of the gene so this might yield it one way of differentiated between true activating mutation and passenger now notice here here the wild-type the so-called wild type but there's a number of them that have very high rat activity despite no K Roth even after an ratification so we didn't look in this group and look for other mutations that might explain it we weren't really powered we have some very interesting hypotheses but we weren't we power to detect any obvious candidate that would suggest activation and in fact we next asked whether this Rask's core can predict drug sensitivity so we applied our model to cell line data so these are two cell line panel le and finger and we found that the drugs that are most correlated with our gas index score was where the MEK inhibitor it's not surprising although we interesting they found that MEK inhibitors were not coordinated with grass mutations so you wouldn't find it if you just looked at the mutations you only observe it you look at our predicted last model so so predictive sensitivity connect and also turned out gamma secretase they didn't look at an auction hibbity we didn't look in vitro whether whether exposure to MEK inhibitor would cause the reverse action will you'd actually see grass activity go down and that's what you do here there's three cell lines all with either of you have a classification through the MSO and here's the transcriptional output of our model showing that that last index is lowered these are both MEK inhibitors here and this is an EGFR inhibitor and then we went to the xenograph domain 1 1 z to graph is key less mutants and so the MEK inhibitor again shows that it can reduce the RAF's pathway activity shown by our model here and as we would expect in the chaos wild-type domain we see no effect of the MEK inhibitor in fact actually has a small perturbation to the pathway MEK inhibitor somehow caused quite increase in fact a fast activation which actually has been reported in the literature so okay finally we looked at whether this our model can predict response to cement and by egfr therapy and so we know that so so toxmap is only given to patients who are KS welcome you know it's not effective in in recitation so we've just looked into wild-type patients and asked in that domain can we predict patients who are more likely to respond had better outcome and we found that in both two data sets one a completely blinded validation set then both cases the high-risk activity with indicative of a worse response as measured by overall so that that summarizes the last work I want make sure we have time for discussion yeah so this is so this is a different delay and this is medicine first of all this is metastatic colon cancer treated with with anti EGFR therapy so for this so before this is he looks in the CMS group we are simply prognostic in turns out this is based on actually responds to therapy so it's a kind of a different domain now we didn't take our subtype to the client in this context holder work but we may expect to see that the CMS 3 subtype as less response because higher activity you sir absolutely yeah I mean that's something to have we haven't done I would again expect that we see in which mean indie scene s3 which is the KSR hi CNS subtype yeah we hit my fam and look we have applied this and are you pregnant AJCC so HACC is not in the business of predictive model so it there's nothing to cancer this is odd distinction could mean response to therapy prognostic this overall survival sort of a baseline HTC's purely prognostic so even though clinically I think most of the interest is responsible therapy they wouldn't be interested in the in the grass model you have a GCC the College of surgery they're not the medical oncologist okay so I'll just add one I could summarize it fairly quickly and that is so HACC I talked about the previous interest in the precision medicine models separately they've approached me in its basic colorectal cancer to ask you know we'd like to see whether there's a sufficient evidence to add biomarkers but the first time ever into a JCC and specifically they want to look at these three biomarkers em aside buf and areas and to ask whether those should be prognostic markers added into Union stage and and and again this is this is very conservative group they have a high level of evidence so to pull this off we're going to have to get the the widest emulation of data together to really and so so here's what we've been doing we've been going after many groups and their data set a number of clinical trials and prospective cohorts and now we're at the point where if they have about 10,000 samples accumulated where we also have MSIP annotated and it's a pretty heterogeneous group so means our family registries with clinical trials and a different stage representation so anyway this has been a very say the least it's been a very challenging endeavor trying to extract real clinical data with outcome metrics but we think we're at the number now where we can now begin to modeling and and see if there's evidence and we have we don't have the full 10,000 yet but we have about 3,000 samples we commemorate modeling that we're starting with the TM which is the baseline so it's just tumor the number of lymph nodes static or not and then asking okay so if you add the NSI and be rack and care ask how much do that improve your critic so here's what we we've begun to observe so here's the TNM when using concordance indexes or nitric we find that when you add an assigned b-raf it can improve and finally kos there's even better doesn't do so as well when you're measuring did level and oh so we can also add tienen and we can also add other clinical covariant like age or sight you might expect that they'd want model it doesn't have as much distinctive ability but let's go we see a trend in Beck MSI and b-raf and then finally can you improve the final model we can also look at time dependent a you see here again the PM PM with femicide the europe and finally at KOF you see a fairly strong leave it at that so we're still a very early stage the eighth edition comes out in 2016 so a lot of work in the next few months to get all the data together harmonize it so we can't do that because the subtyping system is based on gene expression and gene expression but for a JCC metric with calculators it's going to have to be on biomarkers another covariance that opportunity can be collected and so that kind of rules out bikini expression domain we are working on a small platform downstream that might be well wildly deployed but still I don't think it's going to be agency C so don't you have to be able to fight in any context we can compare and we do find that the CMS are predictive independent of of these markers here and it's like gareth bale europe so they do provide information over and beyond what these markets provide but but it's just about practically the bible that's right yeah he said yeah we about half the data has sim setters as well and i think there is evidence but i don't think we have enough samples in the way we have within a Siberia let me let me just acknowledge them key members of this of this work the rodriguez easton he's a medical oncologist at Bobby Brown who's been last few years at age and even a lot of us work or let go most of our partners especially in the colorectal domain had been European groups so we have French Netherlands UK aldebran Belgium our collaborators here in the states of the Mayo Clinic and OHS you would go gray and D Anderson and Renae burns I will finally add that stage of hiring the postdocs or graduate students who are near completion we're very interested in talking to you so thank you very much those six group previously have different classification system you invite them together I've seen they are still friend because even a task which is to forget about their own data third world countries joined it and said now you act on queue to class assignment based on their own system we didn't ask them to the ablution discovery so it's not so much of a challenge for them to be classification because discovery per se right yeah it's a vegetable cat since what's the green share their data and the green that whatever we find is what they're going to find support and keeping how large this overall group is I assume the conclusion were happy to graviton we're happy plunder lifetime and then we want to have the community to further evaluate it probably were published well you have plans to establish a smaller sets but activity really yes that's what we're currently working on we're talking to a few diagnostic companies again you're very interested in but even at the end of the day even if it could platform I still always the question okay what what's the clinical utility I think this is an important in the research domain and clinical trials companies are running political crowds are also very interested in being able to salvage their drugs and finding that it was spawned and particular subsets but just for your clinician I don't think could be wrapped patients and we know that you have to do something about Kos activations either not treat those patients with the EGFR receptor inhibitors or find a way to knock down Kos activity and otherwise it's prognostic it's useful for counseling and discussion and it's certainly a base for further discovery and one teaching point Justin said multiple climbs how heterogeneous cancers are and I urge you all to use the term cancers in the room and the verb are instead of is so it's clear that you understand the heterogeneity of cancers thank you nice like what miss explain a little bit about particular drugs energy one of your project is yes we're currently working on a pilot so and you might imagine how pharmaceuticals are very interested in understanding their own drug so they run these drug large numbers cell line they do the mono therapy liquid diet et cetera and now they're starting to do all the combinations so AstraZeneca is sitting the big data set many tens of thousands of combinations create looked at and they don't know what to do with it because they don't really understand it and I'm not sure anyone really understands it so they were partnering with them to post a challenge to see whether what what are what are the what are the the thought process that we have to go through to think about it sooner just behavior I don't think it could be very straightforward basically looking at the omics naive way it's gonna be thinking about network structures and pathways and how drudge synergy is likely to occur that sometimes could be completely orthogonal pathways because there they're sequential linear and you have to target an upstream and downstream so it's it's a it's a hard problem and we're going to the exercise of this evaluating whether whether we even have robust enough going to be it's copy number it's not going to be and this is unfortunate I don't know a lot this is again doing it but it is to look at you know to be able to look at clonal evolution for example and understand some of this isn't silikal by the way so in fact I think it's all we're going to be able to be able to make permutation perturbations that would cause some kind of evolutionary trajectory I want to pick up on your a very good question about synergies I think it could be dissected for starters like this there are at least two different reasons strategies for synergies one is to get higher efficacy at the point of initial treatment so understanding the pathway is involved in the ones you can target simultaneously it should be effective and that's credible I'm rational it's not just statistical random testing if you look at it that way the second reason the worry about synergies is to survive mutations that cause we resistance and this is a predictable effect just like with microbes it is shocking that we've had this strategy and Clinical Oncology to treat with one drug when we know that the cancer cells are very likely to mutate and become existent so to survive resistance it's very important to target at least two different sites to maintain control growing and that really should be separated yeah and unfortunately I don't think we're gonna be able to look at this because we don't know how you don't know all the mechanisms and we won't we don't have the data to and then there's a third which is how do you how do you decrease the toxicity the idea that you can get two drugs in lower doses and have high rank which is instead of trying to knock down hard a particular target and another target to try to make a drug that works on the protein-protein interaction like p53 mdm2 and at a much lower dose you can interfere with poking protein interaction there knocking out the activity of either this has been clinically useful already and it's a general strategy what I'm saying is ten you I don't know whatever care about that can you a drug that that excellent and dinner tack like hybrid fail attacking the just what's happening with the drug is selecting usually would problem with resistant selecting particularly [Applause]
