at the end it worked closely with one of Informatics master's students that graduated a few years back newest pretties moved on now okay folks so Marcy our regular hosts and coordinator and organizer a master of schedules is is not here she's ill and out sick at a minute and we wish her a speedy recovery so it falls to me to introduce our speaker today Melissa do him potentially from ecology and evolutionary biology I'm gonna tell us some quiet full mix approaches to the study of ecology on cultivated viruses of which there's a sea of the might there right exactly there are quite literally like all right so just get started thanks for joining me today and I think this is the kind of talk that if you have questions or comments along the way just go for it because I think we're gonna be going a lot of different places and I think it's the most way to have a effective way to have a discussion on this topic so just to present a bit about what you can expect take-home message I think will be that viruses for sure underlie processes in microbial ecology and evolution in ways that you might not have considered or thought of before and so I'll see dear your brains with a few examples from ocean systems as well as human microbiome projects and then focus the last part of the talk on some of the challenges in recent progress towards working with omics data so community viral metagenomic data as we try to derive knowledge from the currently amassing datasets and hopefully that will make more sense by the end of the talk so just a primer as I mentioned that by-and-by the biology of what is a virus so when I talk about viruses in this seminar today I'll be talking about infectious agents that replicate only within a living host cell so they obligate we need that live host and viruses can be take take on many forms that can be single or double stranded DNA or RNA and essentially they're they're nucleic acid genome wrapped in a thin coat of protein and I might use the term phage or a bacteria phage interchangeably with viruses today because I'm a microbiologist and I'm actually only interested or I'm only studying viruses that infect bacteria and those are bacteria phage and they the dominant ones that we at least dominant in our studies look like this they're called bacteria phage here's a head capsid filled with our nucleic acid genome and either long or hardly visible short tail and as far as how they replicate they can either be lytic this is kind of canonical idea of how viruses work or you have a virus attaching to a host microbial cell injecting its dean genome and replicating using the host machinery and energy and eventually lysine popping out of the cell and let me say lyse we also mean that it's going to kill itself the host cell it also has a possibility of taking on this lysogenic state where instead of immediately going to kill its host it can hang out as a plasmid and replicate as the host cell replicates or it can integrate into the host genome into what we call a pro phage and replicate along with the host cell until something happens which we don't have a confident grasp on what dictates this switch it will either come out of the lysogenic seat and begin replicating in lytic fashion and eventually kill its host most of this model comes from studying RNA they do yeah yep and and most of this view comes from studying ecoli in the lab and we're only now beginning to carry out similar studies using environmentally relevant systems and are seeing that there's actually huge diversity in the modes of infection and replication and and this view is actually constantly evolving right now so the next few slides will be devoted to why do we care about viruses in particular viruses in the ocean that aren't necessarily pathogenic to humans or fish or any other charismatic megafauna whales why do we care about them well it's only it's been less than 30 years that we've recognized how abundant they are so sometimes sheer numbers can do a lot towards giving motivation to study something and these are juxtaposed some of my two favorite images to put side-by-side so here on the left is you see okay sorry I'm saying right is an image of a drop of seawater when you look through the lens of a microscope everything with DNA is stand in this green fluorescent dye and then if you turn around look outside up its face through the lens of a telescope you might see an image like this and I can tell you it's almost as eerie and kind of viscerally inspiring to look down into a microscope and imagine what all of these little entities are and what they're kind of mandated to do as it is to look up and think about what is beyond us in the universe and beyond it's just kind of impressive fun but now back to the numbers so in the late 80s early 90s we started to recognize there are a lot of particles in the few hundred nanometer scale that contain DNA in seawater what are they well when you look under the electron microscope they look like viruses and around that time we were able to first get these numbers of 10 to the 6 10 to the 8 viruses per milliliter of seawater and that number seems to hold no matter where you are in the global oceans and even freshwater systems and if you think about this extrapolated across all of the oceans on the planet and think about how large these viruses are here to stand them end-to-end head to tail they would expand extend 10 to the 7 light-years from our planet beyond I don't have much of an intuitive appreciation for what that means but if you start thinking of okay our nearest star is only four light-years and our own Milky Way is three orders of magnitude smaller than that it's impressive there's a lot of viral particles out there which leads researchers to tend to you know start their abstracts and introductions of their papers with this line that viruses are the most abundant biological entity on the planet so there are abundant I think you can appreciate that well we also have begun to appreciate that the lysis so that killing of their host cells during infection impacts global elemental budgets so that's there I'm referring to carbon and nitrogen and phosphorus and sulfur budgets so this is what a cell looks like when it's being attacked by viruses attaching to its cell surface and we have been able to determine the viruses kill in the order of 10 to 40 percent of bacteria in the ocean each day those numbers arrive mostly from activity at the surface of the water and of the oceans and and there's enough out there to believe that these numbers will be less as you go down we also know that that number so if you look at all of the carbon fluxes like where is carbon going in this kind of a system the largest flux is actually happening due to the lysis by viruses so that's 150 Giga tons per year in this process affects the efficiency of the biological pump and that pump refers to the transfer of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere down into the oceans through photosynthesis so organisms doing photosynthesis incorporating that carbon into their cells and biomass and in a perfectly working ideological biological pump that carbon is then kind of transferred in the form of dead cell debris or fecal matter and eventually sinking through the water column down to the deep-sea where it's buried hopefully for eons until we decide to drill it and pump pump it back up and burn it and send it back into the atmosphere and so that's kind of how the balance is being disturbed right now but another way that that transfer or efficiency of that carbon is sinking is affected is through the activity of viruses and so here again it is a model of this where light is used by primary producers during photosynthesis and hopefully it moves on to things that eat it grazers and onto the carbon chain or through other bacteria that are eating the dissolved organic matter and then on but if you introduce viruses into this kind of model you have something that we refer to as a viral shunt and if you have these cells being blasted apart by viruses then they're not as accessible to the things that eat bacteria they're smaller they're in the dissolved form and it returns carbon to this kind of carbon pool here at the surface of the ocean and thereby affects the efficiency of the transfer of carbon down and so that's recognizing how active they are how many are out there it's likely a component of this global system that is not being recognized or incorporated into biogeochemical models for instance our climate models and it's responsible for shunting about a quarter of the carbon that's fixed by photosynthesis in this process so it's important but not necessarily considered yet it's getting or getting there so they're abundant they impact global element tilled budgets and while they're infecting they're also influencing the evolution and diversification of their hosts so microbial diversification and all just one example there are many but this is an example of how it can impact substrate utilization so that would be the things in the environment that their host microbes are eating and using for energy and lead to ecosystem efficiency so as I mentioned they drive to post diversification here yeah so this is an image that we use a lot in environmental microbial ecology and what this represents are so these are the genomes of five of the most abundant ocean microbes and you can imagine along this axis is the length of the genome and when you then recruit reads from environmental of metagenomic data sets is everyone okay with that concept in turn with a meta-genome ists i'm happy - ok cool so they have metagenomic data sets we recruit the reads to these genomes and here on the y-axis is the percent similarity so you can see up here these are near 100 percent identical to those genomes of organisms we've cultured from the ocean but then along this spectrum you see these areas where there are barely raised recruiting or recruiting it just moderate identity we call those regions hypervariable regions so those are parts of these host genomes where there's a lot of variability you don't see coverage in natural populations so we call those hypervariable regions hvr and if this is yet at the otu level so this is a single strain of this microbe another strain of the different strain of microbe of the same species and again here different strain so I don't know it depends on your working definition of what I know to you is yeah so if your teen you would be for instance percent similarity of 16s ribosomal or an aging exactly yet so that's of course ot you you know by definition means its operational so you can define it as you want to and I'll get into that later about you know how do you define that for viruses but yeah if you're using a definition whereby we're considering you know the 16s gene ah then yes these would be different ot use and the same down here so if you look at what these regions are what they're over-represented by substrate acquisition proteins so these are things that are pulling out substrates from the environment for the host to use and we also know those acquisition proteins tend to be phage recognition sites because there are these big extracellular proteins that are hanging out outside the cell and that's what they just tend to dock onto when they're looking for potential hosts and so that interaction is potentially intriguing and in this study they predicted that phage avoidance so trying to change those surface proteins to avoid the the phages in your media environment will then lead to differences in your ability to pick up different substrates and this phage avoidance is predicted to then drive host strain level or to you level micro diversity and you can imagine this then favored cells that use low concentration substrates that might not otherwise be favorable but eventually gives rise to lineages that could feed on all available substrates in an ecosystem and so it's predicted that this activity in that way leads to ecosystem efficiency where a greater diversity of substrates in the environment are able to be used by the organisms that are living there have more complete metabolic set of metabolic pathways it couldn't be there hasn't been a lot of empirical lab based work to back that idea up but I think what can help close the gap is to consider that the types of modifications are probably happening are not drastic so it might just be a slightly different form of carbon that once you get it into your cell you have the basic machinery there to deal with it it might be one slightly different modification that you'll need and then you then get into the consideration of where might that type of system across the full community of microbes what type of microbe might this kind of model be most active in so there's this dichotomy when we think about marine microbes or microbes in general between our strategist and Kay strategist so things that are and it's renowned are known to be good at boom-bust conditions where they're metabolically very able to handle a lot of diverse substrates but they might not necessarily have super streamlined genomes and as a result you see them where you know if you have a carbon pulse of some specific form of carbon then the things that are kind of these are strategists type microbes that are suited to deal with a lot of diverse substrates might be able to kind of bloom when that bursts of available foods available it is as present as opposed to some other streamline microbes which actually a perfect example would be these guys plod you bacter they're more known for being you know present at ok ubiquitously but not able to grow super fast and in response to diverse substrate so you might see different patterns through this type of model depending on you know who you are as a microbe and what you're able to do what you're mad about that allows you to do so so that's kind of a conceptual model of how things might be working but you can imagine it's not going to be Universal across the community and could also depend on what your specialty is is a microbe it does so there's been there's one study that I know of that looked at a strain looked at it kind of infectivity by across a swath of virus's let them kind of co-evolve so that the profile differed it was now sensitive to different suite of viruses and then it just looked at a simple bio log essay which looks at substrate utilization and saw correlated shifts in that and that was just a qualitative you know description and not necessarily the mechanisms of how that worked but there is definitely in a godel evidence to show that there is some connection between substrate utilization and fish sensitivity just pretty pretty cool and intriguing but it gets even more interesting so we also know that viruses acquire metabolic genes which we refer to it this auxilary metabolic genes AMG's you'll hear passed around from their hosts so what these genes are they're originally of host origin and they encode proteins that augment or supplement host function idea being that they indirectly enhanced viral Fitness during infection you know where this idea was first discovered as in cyanobacteria in the ocean and this is a model of a cyanobacteria photosystem so cyanobacteria virus is infecting cyanobacteria among the first that were sequenced their genomes were sequenced from in the early 2000s and it was in one of the first sign of bacterial viral genomes this was discovered that it contained this PSB a gene which is essential component of the photosystem 2 in cyanobacteria so this is the engine that generates energy for the for the hosts from sunlight hitting these photosystem so it's absolutely critical the other interesting thing about this protein is it's one of the most rapidly turned over proteins in the host cell when photosynthesis is active so grades pretty rapidly it's rapidly turned over and we can think of it as one of the bottlenecks of photosynthesis in the host so it's a metabolic bottleneck we started sequencing more Center bacterial genomes and looking at metagenomic data sets and saw that viruses actually carry a lot of the essential genes of this photosystem are a photosynthetic engine kind of that idea is that there would be a fitness benefit to the virus to have one of these or carry one of these proteins that's the rate limiting step of photosynthesis during infection because you're you're in there your host is not a super fast replicating cell and so you're gonna have to live with your hosts for a little while to generate enough energy to replicate yourself and so the idea is well you're taxing your hosts for you know the machinery needed to replicate yourself why not give your host a boost to sustain this infection in replication and that's the conceptual part where the fitness benefit to the virus has come from and this is kind of an idea of how this might work in action so in addition to photosynthesis genes we've now found a number of different genes and different metabolic processes that these sign of bacterial viruses carry and this is a nice conceptual image of how that might work you your virus you insert your genome you supplement different metabolic pathways of your host during infection to help you produce more viruses see this more often in temperate or non let it age where it spend more time yeah so no but that's I think mostly a database or you know bias so the problem is for this photo sign a bacterial system there's only one site flow virus which are the ten type that tend to integrate that's sequence and isolated most of what we sequence and isolate from prochlorococcus the cyanobacteria tend to be those that do not integrate and so that actually might get back to that dichotomy I was referring to earlier that these are one of the K strategists that have more streamlined genomes the genomes are less than half the size of some of the other heterotrophs that are out there in the ocean for instance the system I work with as a heterotrophic system that are a perfect classical example of the our strategist boom-bust and of the eight viruses I was just working with six of them integrate and and so I think that kind of trade-off might also manifest as a result of the hosts metabolic strategy and so I so we can't really we don't have a sample size and breadth to describe that but you would think that if you're integrating why not supplement your host metabolism know with what you carry but there are there are other pieces of evidence to show that there's actually a fitness benefit to carrying a pro pro phage and integrated profusion even with the burden of having the extra genomic DNA to replicate yeah and there's some other examples so in in the system I work with but you actually won't talk enough about or as much about because it's in the early stages of developing an idea of what is happening infection but some of the genes that those heterotrophic viruses carry really to kind of should I close it all the way here fooling your host out of starvation so there aren't a lot of substrates available and and there's not much material for your hosts to live off of they tend to go into a dormant or resting state and I've seen a lot of viruses across many different hosts from the oceans carry genes that would influence the pool of an effector molecule that would tell your host to kind of sleep slow down your metabolism but the the protein that these viruses carry and it changes so with which shut off that system and effectively say hey wake up I know you don't have a lot of substrates but we don't need a lot because I know you're a fast grower I'm not going to be here long I know you can replicate me really quickly if I tell you to and so when hypothesis or the reason to carry a gene like that would be to kind of fool your hosts out of this kind of resting state so if there are enough proteins out there just suspect something like that might be happening and they tend to be over-represented in marine viruses for whatever reason right so I mentioned this is influencing the photosystem and so you can appreciate the influence that that this action activity might have on carbon and oxygen cycles but we've seen similar stories emerge from viruses in the in the deep sea so these are viruses that were identified from hydrothermal vent communities where in the story very analogous to the photosynthesis story this is the pathway involved in sulfur oxidation and we found this gene responsible for this step across four different viral genomes that we are able to close from metagenomic data and again this is the rate-limiting step we believe in this process so it seems to extend beyond photosynthesis and to other essential energy harvesting pathways yep yeah so physically these are collected with a a roverso or uh like a an ROV that was tethered to the ship went down to the vent was suited with cameras and arms and sampling devices and not sure about the specific sample but but there's the capacity to directly filter underwater at the site and then fix store your filters so that when they're they come up and back to the lab you can extract the DNA another option is just to bring the water up from the deep and filter and filter it on the boat and then extract DNA do community sequencing assemble and then what came out were these close genomes of viruses and this was actually a microbial sized fraction and so these were abundant viruses that were there at a high enough coverage that we could cover it clips them and see that they look like viruses based on instructional proteins and eventually linked them to their hosts which I'll talk about later and so this is just a reminder that some small changes in the efficiency of one pathway can alter planetary chemistry on a global scale and we've already seen viruses likely influencing the efficiency of several elemental pathways on a global scale so those are some anecdotes from the ocean so why we should care and there's been recent look at viruses related to human microbiome as you know we have started to invest a lot more resources intellectual capacity and understanding the microbes associated with humans entire cassettes yeah so it's a good question and I think the answer will could differ if my experience was with other viruses but I don't see at least in that in the marine viruses the comparative genomics idea of marine viruses many examples of cassettes so usually it tends to be lone genes that are picked up as as I was showing an example up there might be kind of other examples and other systems yeah so so two things and come to mind we know that the most prolific creative force in viral genome evolution is this module transfer or module recombination of modules we call which are effectively cassettes in kind of the microbial world but they don't tend to be microbial I know this to microbial cassettes they tend to be units relevant for phage functions so you see for instance a teal module and I have a perfect example of this I should have thrown the slide on there so I recently was utilizing a genome that came from the oceans that has by morphology I couldn't tell this but when I looked at the genome sequence has the tail of a virus from one family and the head of a virus from another family and that totally messes up our concept and the economy of taxonomic classification but it's a perfect example of module like functional module swapping but you tend to see that with Viral functions and not so much kind of metabolic cassettes that you that we appreciate from microbial genome organization and I think that might just be due to the constraints on genome size so you have to be able to package your whole genome into your capsid and that's a very regulated process that's going on inside the host during application and if you picked up all of a sudden a multi gene cassette I think you'd really mess up the synchronous mmm synchronization of that process and so I think it's harder to do that thank you you're able to pick up maybe genes from time to time and there is patterns related to where the genes might be work organized and located in the host genome that has to do with easy spots for recombination but you don't tend to see whole metabolic gene cassettes in viral tubules but you do see cassettes we just call them modules they're usually related to viral function in particular in particular structural function so just a few anecdotal stories from human by rooms so in the gut we see disease specific features in the enteric virome so viruses from enteric samples that are specific to disease states for in this case inflammatory bowel disease and the authors in this study saw increased viral richness and decreased bacterial diversity in the disease states and they claimed and not explained by changes in microbial communities and they hypothesize maybe this was from proof Asians popping out of host cells that changed the viral community makeup or possibly migration of new viruses into the system maybe through diet there's also been some look at the lungs so looking at the vine realm of cystic fibrosis patients and you see here the red dots are CF blue are non CF patients the super small study size but they just saw that they are distinct for the most part and the lungs and the Pseudomonas related to CF infection has been an interesting candidate for considering the use of viruses in fish therapy so this is just an example in a mouse model where here you're visualizing the presence of a Pseudomonas biofilm in blue also in this line and in this plus indicates treatment where Asia's infecting Pseudomonas were applied to the mouse two hours after the Pseudomonas and by the end of the study eight hours later had nearly cleared the mouse of the infection and there are some clinical trials underway in UK looking at that location of therapy yeah yeah it's a it's a great question and that's exactly the nature of the clinical study so what they tend to do in application of the fascias is to provide cocktails basically they're out there hunting as many viruses as they can infecting certain hosts at a given taxonomic breadth and saying okay this is our cocktail of viruses for this treating this disease in the hopes that you'll get around that and that you might engage the kind of warfare in the body yeah I'm sure and who's to say kind of the yeah diversity of strains that are out there infecting I think yeah you have the same potential for resistance earliest similar mechanisms but I think it's a little bit it's still a more dynamic system than antibiotics so but yeah and it's therapy has been used for decades close to 100 years in some form another just not much in exactly Russia and Georgia yep and in Europe in World War two in particular treating wounds they just didn't know really what they were using or what it was cheating yeah on that note so there's also been some look by Geoffrey Hannigan who is a recent Lee he just joined us here in Michigan he's working in patch Lewis's lab and his thesis PhD thesis was looking at the skin microbiome so and where he saw site-specific persistent commensal viral populations across the human body and his work and others have shown though that these viruses can also be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes and this is a really neat study that showed that antibiotic resistance is enriched in fish populations after the hosts of the same system had been perturbed with drugs so it's as if the application of antibiotics led to greater greater capacity for the viral community to serve as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance that they then pass to the microbes crazy and of course people are also talking about the implications this might have for it though that these pages aren't infecting human cells they could aggravate and lead to fish human cell interactions all you need to immune responses 15 minutes to talk about the challenges and the tools and technology to get around these challenges but if nothing else I've piqued your interest in why these phases are interesting and an understudy component of a microbiome and it's rare that it was in our field we have a chance to refer to the Executive Office of the President of the United States for saying that you know this is an underappreciated system in a recent report from the fast-track action committee on mapping a microbiome they listed action or area of need number two more study and viral communities were recently they currently represent only three percent of the total investment in microbiome research yet we know from the few studies that have come out actually mostly from ocean systems that they are really important in the functioning of the system as a whole and as we see now also likely involved in disease state in humans and antibiotic resistance and transfer so we know microbes are critical to kind of how the environment is working you can now appreciate that viruses are a third column in this system so there's a lot of interactions between microbial hosts in the environment the environment from microbial hosts the environment on viruses so they're degraded for instance by UV exposure viruses influence environment in that they kind of feed back to the dissolved organic matter or carbon pool one example microbes influenced their viruses viruses obligate we need their microbes for replication but microbes are also a reservoir of gene transfer to viral genomes viruses for sure influence their hosts and that they kill them their life states are the products of those killed dead cells a food source for microbes so it represents 50% of heterotrophic diet in the ocean so those are things that eat carbon they diversify host populations they're responsible for horizontal gene transfer and they're involved in metabolic reprogramming so they pick up metabolic genes from their hosts and influence the expression of those metabolic pathways and what I am interested in and what our lab focus is on is this relationship in particular and using omics approaches to investigate it in both lab and environmental settings with the goal being to go to build beyond descriptive stories and to integrate the biological knowledge that we can get from viral omics so in particular I've heard of we do metagenomics we do transcriptomics we do proteomics lipid omics must have a little mix right now those are all like never been done but data now samples now sent to the facilities that will generate the data we'll see how it can build upon our biological knowledge and use this to inform predictive ecological and evolutionary models to better understand and of the processes and mechanism that are manifesting of course there are challenges in our abilities to do that and just to name a few that all Rafael like expand upon is the paucity of context so there are definitely viral database biases as we refer to earlier how do we do ecology with no conserved marker genes so in microbial ecology we tend to use the 16s ribosomal ribosomal RNA gene conserved across microbes there's not a single gene that's present in all viruses let alone all bacteriophage so how do we think about and approach the diversity that is out there what defines a viral species or a viral population it's related to that you know how do we define an OT you and yeah what is the right code to you criteria to decide whether our definition is appropriate and then with all these viruses that are out there how do we link them to their hosts because in a way their knowledge of a virus is very little without knowing who it infects how abundant its host is what the metabolic processes in the environment or organism human gut are and that's what we're working on right now mm-hmm so this first piece 97% of nearly 2,500 sequence viruses in fact only four bacterial phyla recent estimates have projected that there's about 1500 estimated bacterial phyla if you consider all of the the newly discovered entities from Medich environmental metagenomic data sets so that's 97% only for bacterial phyla there's a huge taxonomic breadth and we don't know anything about the viruses infecting and for the most part cultured viruses are biased towards clinical isolates which is understandable so we've been able to manually recover complete viruses from metagenomic data sets the proof of concept has been in practice for several years and example I gave earlier with those viruses we were able to assemble from metagenomic metagenomes from the deep-sea recently developed tool there you go it's beer sorter you can check out this reference if you're interested in using it which is an improved high-throughput phase detection program whose algorithm is far more effective than the previously developed kin prophase identification tools here's the beer sorter out here in blue which improves recall imprecision in the systems benchmarked with and we can use this now for both complete microbial genomes WGS so non non closed microbial genomes meta genomic context incomplete genomes it can also be used for testing the contamination state of your viral meta-genome whether or not microbes were passively sequenced along with them and when this was applied to all of the complete microbial genomes non closed genomes in GenBank as well as this untapped resource single amplified genome so those are like single-cell sequence yeah amplified genomes from single cells rather than full cultures we were able to pull out viruses or genomic information for viruses infecting so these black and bold here are phyla where we have no cultured viruses and red represent the addition of viral sequences to phyla where we did have some sequenced and yes we don't know because everything's done after the facts environmental their civil the way the process works is you use cell sorting technology in the lab you have a culture you don't I think near 100% of these the investigators didn't know they were viruses there with them they sorted the cell to amplify the genome sequence it BAM these are cells that are really hard to culture and so before the single cell sorting technology and amplification and sequencing we weren't able to know about their genomes so single cells hurting awesome came along we could figure out how to sequence these guys know there's this data set of zags we refer to them as and so Simon the developer of fierce order just thought okay let's apply this tool to that data set which right now is not in most public sequence databases because they're thought of as like things that didn't assemble into the hosts microbial genome is just junk DNA but actually he was able to pull out so many viruses from that dataset that we've now augmented available viral genomes greater than tenfold more than this 2,400 and in a diversity for a diversity of hosts and part of it is because we were able to go beyond those hosts that are able to be cultured through this X technology so it's it's really cool okay this is brand-new stuff that the data like this data has hardly been used now environmental well genomics because it's just out so we've improved genomic context starting to get beyond database biases but still we have this problem what do we do with all this genomic data we don't have conserved marker genes so one way that we've been organizing the viral unknown is through the generation of protein clusters these protein clusters have given us now a handle to apply some more traditional otu OT you based ecological theory to the viral community in viral sequence space so most of these metagenomic greens are unknown what do we do with them this actually isn't too new idea of protein clustering these are kind of the metrics we use for defining a cluster was first introduced in the Goss analysis which was global ocean sampling campaign led by craig Venter where he just took his yacht around the war spots of the global ocean and sequence to whatever he collected she's easy to criticize but actually was it awesome dump of actually no pun intended because contamination of sampling while people were using the toilet on the ship and use of an enteric mic so anyway microbial sequence data environmental microbial sequence data into public databases and has been pretty useful so they first used these protein clusters to describe a new diversity they're a nice thing being you don't need to know anything about the function or the taxonomy of the proteins you have a lot of uh Nana Tate 'add protein closers but you can start tracking their abundance across the globe there's been two recent pushes of sequencing viral metagenomes both led by the sullivan lab at the time at the university of arizona so this together has led to over 1 million protein clusters of virus proteins and they were then able to use the kind of abundance and yeah of these individual protein clusters to start doing things like coming up with richest estimates and comparing richness estimates across different biomes and seeing okay now we can say that coastal viral communities are more rich than open ocean seems simple but we couldn't do it before it starts to give us some context for appreciating how viral communities differ across the globe from this we were also able to estimate global viral gene diversity with accumulation curves which rounds out and about a half or over just over a million viral proteins predicted globally but still about that appropriate owed to you and I think this is probably the story that I'll end on so up until a few years ago people thought about viral evolution and viral genomes it's just being this rampant horizontal gene transfer where there are no rules to wear jeans go where they come from you just see this module transfer across viruses that infect all microbial life and that there because of this transfer it would be too messy for meaningful population level patterns to emerge a few available technologies have led to a different story so this is a pretty neat technique that we hope to get up and running now here in Michigan called viral tagging and the idea being you have a viral population and you have a host that you're interested in this was first developed with Seneca caucus which is a cyanobacterium from the ocean an environmental so viruses from the environment cultured host viruses from the environment it took viruses you know millions and millions and millions in a few milliliters dyed them with a fluorescent dye now all those environmental viruses are green they introduced these green stained viruses which are still active to the bait host culture and then they sent this and if system in through a flow cytometry and what this does is it sorts populations based on the green fluorescence and properties of the cell itself and so what emerged were two populations here represents tagged host cells that now have this green tag and so they would look like this host cells now with a fluorescently labeled virus attached and these are the non tagged cells you can then sort these out and sequence them which is what they did and so here are all the sequences of viruses from the environment that infect this host what do they look like and this represents the ordination of the genomic content of the viral population infecting this specific host and before we did this we weren't sure if there would just be a complete smear of you know messy overlapping populations but what happened was actually what came out were distinct points surrounded by clouds of variability but still they were relatively discrete populations and if you started to draw circles around how much variation is depicted in these what we started calling populations it looks like we can define these populations as being ninety five to a hundred percent similar at the nucleotide level and as we start applying this rule to metagenomes we also add across eighty percent of the genome the question then was okay is this meaningful does this represent meaningful ecological distinctions this cutoff this 95 percent Everage nucleotide identity across 80 percent of the genome and so what I had in my hand were a range of viruses infecting us specific species of hosts across a range of relatedness so for instance in this box these viruses fit this criteria there are 95 percent similar also these viruses and I also head them in culture so I could I could look at the infection phenotypes across many hosts of these kind of populations that we've now defined from this metric and what I see is that so this is one population these four all belong to one population that they have comparable phenotypes so on different hosts they have the same kind of virus production rate which if you're a virus that's very important for defining your fitness in the environment and so we believe this to be a appropriate metric for kind of describing the ecologic ecological distinctness of these populations and so this was some of the first evidence that show that okay this criteria for defining viral populations might have represent meaningful ecological distinctions and it's kind of that's what we strive for in our definition of an OT you write something that we can track the cohesiveness across a genome or between genomes and in the lab we want to be able to show that it means something in ecological terms and so we think we're on the right track with this definition and it's now been applied to describing populations in wild virus communities so from assembled contexts from viral metagenomes this is across the entire genome Oh 80% of the genome but this analysis is on the complete genomes yeah I'll just show you some pretty pictures so one of the final challenges then as I referred to earlier is linking viruses to hosts and so we're developing there's some in situ I'm sorry in silico techniques where you can look at the tetranucleotide signatures of both viruses and hosts and use that as evidence to suggest that by certain viruses you're assembling map to certain microbes you can also use CRISPR spacers which I won't get into but that's another nice way to use sequence bits to link spacer regions to the hosts that they were derived from and there's also this microscopy based technique where you might say okay this viral population has this conserved stretch I'm going to use that as a probe to develop fish fluorescence in situ hybridization so that in the end I say I want to label everything of genus hooter Alterman is blue and I want to label everything with a sequence tag that I've identified and from a virus in red so that when those two probes overlap in the same cell you get a blue purple signal and that would tell me that's a pseudo ultram on its host with the virus I'm interested in so that's a microscopy based technique that we've developed and are currently applying into environmental samples to try to make that link and it works really well it's beautiful and this is accumulation of a lot of hard work so virus in red cell in green through the progression of an infection and even stained free viruses you could see kind of a explosion of viral cells after infection and that's where we are and that's what we do we apply these kinds of techniques to heterotrophic systems in the oceans viruses a hydrothermal vents we've looked at we're also looking at viruses infecting the Great Lakes Microcystis populations which that's the balloon forming algae that you hear about forming in western basin of Lake Erie we're always looking for students that are interested in bioinformatics development and if you're interested in any of the resources I referred to there's a great new initiative run by bunny Hurwitz at the University of Arizona developing interactive data Commons and cyber infrastructure for microbial in viral ecology where this tool is hosted and all of these protein clusters are hosted and we bunny will be here next semester to present this system so I'll be sure that the community is aware of her talk and this is a thank you to my lab with Astra sees working those students and technicians that are working on virus projects and just a shout out to we're soon to be playing around with samples outside of the ocean but looking at viruses in the role of these viruses and cystic fibrosis here at on campus thanks any more questions cool thanks I'm glad we we asked them along the way I'm always available if anyone wants to talk
