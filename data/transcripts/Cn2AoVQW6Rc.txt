tools in technology some in our series there's a sign in sheet going around please try to sign in we have a presentation next week and then of course we're not gonna have a presentation on Thanksgiving Day I don't really think anyone wanted to come in for that and then we'll have startup again of course the week after Thanksgiving so I'm pleased to present today's speaker we have Mitch Fernandez who is a grad student in GCM and be in cave on a Darwin's well hey Thank You Marci um thank everybody for being here my name is Mitch I've been working for Kavon for about a year and a half certainly not on a project that I'll talk about briefly I'm on hold for the moment I was gonna give you an intro to tensor flow there's gonna be pretty high-level so if you're a deep learning expert you might feel a little bored so what is tensor flow Google put this out about a year and a half ago it's a machine learning platform that they're using for a lot of things it was originally geared for deep learning specifically but you can do very basic things with it as well even though it would be kind of overkill it's currently available for pretty much every operating system I think it was challenging to get it on Windows about a year ago that's no longer true it's has a lot of interfaces where to Python but you can also do C++ are I think there's a MATLAB interface and it's kind of maybe not official so whatever programming language are used to you can probably use tensorflow with it it's very fast it's got a lot of really good tools and optimizers in it for for deep learning which is one of the main reasons for using it so why would you use deep learning in the first place well there's lots of applications but the most common one or the classic one is object recognition if you've got an image you want a machine to figure out what's in it and everybody loves seeing cats and this is one of the things I don't know if this was the first thing they tried to train machine vision with was fast but apparently it's you know the most popular at this point I think what you want to do if you get an image you want to figure out what's in the image you want a machine to be able to do it first identify what the object is and this is your cat another thing is you've got multiple out if you want to differentiate between them so you've got a Cat Cat duck dog and yet what I can find out the outlines of these images I'm gonna start talking about the medical imaging things I don't have really great examples of medical imaging because as far as tensorflow because I don't know anybody exactly doing that we're not actually doing it in our lab we're gonna be doing it with my project there like I said that's a bit on hold for the moment so my interest was in understanding how people learn how to move especially when the moves are quite complicated I've been practicing martial arts for a decade or so and I'm really really bad at it but I learned it over time and I was trying to figure out ways of getting people to learn it more easily and I started thinking of the medical applications for this I started realizing that if you could get a machine to visualize a person as they move you could classify their structure in a way they're very similar to any other simple structure like numbers or things like this if you can get an outline of what that person is how that person is standing and how that person moves you might be able to identify problems with how they're moving and figuring out ways of getting them to move a little bit more efficiently a little more fluidly again this is a martial arts and you can see that these drawings are kind of ideal and this is a an expert in a position and there are little differences here between how he's standing and how that position might be and of course he's standing in a particular pose that isn't demonstrated here but if you look at the feet there are differences how do you get the the computer to spot those differences and figure them out and are they predictive of what this person is going to be doing next of course what I was going to be doing was not just static images I was gonna be using video we ran into problems with with vendors with in reality systems we got a nice setup but we were realizing this is gonna take years to get done and I'm a grad student and would like to get out of here at some point but the the medical application was for rehabilitation people who had suffered strokes if we can figure out the whole idea of how they're learning we can come up with ways of having them try to perform emotion and have them see what they're doing and how to how to adjust it so this is our application I hope to get back to it at some point but for right now let me get on to how a tensor flow itself work so what's a tensor this is a problem that a question people ask it surprises me quite a bit tensor is just a matrix maybe of zero or more dimension so a zero zero rank tensor would be just a scalar then your vector would be ranked one and as you add dimensions you know a matrix is just two by two you can have a could have three dimension to get flirtin if you get multiple dimensions and and tensor flow it's just a method for getting these matrices of different dimensions running them through a calculation process of matrix multiplication matrix manipulation and coming up with a little output for what you're doing so and this is a basic example which is actually taken from a tensor flow structure your nodes here are calculations and your edges are actual textures that are flowing through this this just flow graphs what they call it and they can get pretty complicated and tensor flow has a nice way of visualizing what what you're doing you can code it up and just use something called tensor board to to visualize all sorts of things about how your your graph is structured and how its functioning now an important detail here when you're using tensor flow the first thing you have to do is actually construct your your graph even without any data which means you have to that you're gonna get those gonna flow through it you have to place order trip those things and you just have to account for them when you're constructing your graph so what happens when data is flowing well you're gonna have some kind of input I'm going to talk about the classical example in a minute where your inputs are going to be some something you're trying to identify if I'm trying something you're trying to classify you're going to run it through some calculation or some series of calculations and then you're gonna get an output that will hopefully help you classify what it is that you were looking at and for identify what was in in your picture or whatever it is that you're trying to the process this is where this is basically the the very basic structure of any kind of neural network is you have some set of inputs which are things that you're trying to classify there are fully connected which means each input is connected to every calculation node you know what's called a hidden layer there's called hidden layers because that you won't necessarily know what the layer is doing even though you kind of can back-trace it but it gets copying we have other layers and this layer is just manipulating your input these again are the ten sewers those are again manipulated out and they end up coming up to an output giving you a prediction of what it is that you input so you don't know what you what you had you had an image with something in it trying to classify it you do a series of manipulations here from here you have new outputs that go into some other layer you do another series in the manipulations and then you come up with something that resembles a prediction of what it is that you had and just to clarify this as I was saying you know these are all calculations and these are going to be your outputs these are just your tensors that are going from layer to layer till finally you get an output so the classic example is handwriting recognition if you saw that guy in the in the martial arts thing you know standing like this to me you kind of look like a letter or a number you can see you can see how you could reduce that to that so this is why I like this example and it's the one that everybody starts with you there's a database of of characters 0 through 9 that people have had written I think there are about 70,000 of these characters and in the database the idea is to get these characters use them to train a network and then predict which character you have this is just an example of how the neural network would work that's called M nest they don't recall it remember what it stands for but it's publicly available and it's it's used all the time so for example if you have the number 3 and you want to manipulate this as if it were not just a number but as some picture you can break this down into a little graph of pixels that you're looking at with each pixel having some kind of brightness or intensity and based on that brightness or intensity you can start learning which you can start reading what a3 look like or what a7 looks like or whatever number you have and again what we're doing is we're starting out with with this group and we're creating an input layer since each number is in a little 28 by 28 graph one thing we can do is instead of representing it as a matrix we can represent it as a vector and just break it into a vector of 784 a slot of size 784 it just makes it a little bit easier to think about how this is happening you do lose some information by it by converting a rank two tensor into a rank one but it's still good enough for these for this purposes you pass I'm sorry you pass and for from each one of these pixels into some hidden layer which does some matrix manipulation and then it goes to an output layer and gets a prediction of what number you have now you actually know what's in this database so you look at your input you do your manipulations and you get some result and your result is going to be wrong what you do then is you you do something called back propagation or some other way of figuring out why your number is wrong and you basically just adjust some of these weights in your hidden layer and do the process again over and over and over so you're training this model to figure out what your 3s look like what your sevens look like et cetera the code for doing this is actually quite simple and I wasn't gonna go through any code but I decided this morning by decade just put it in so you can see it's just a few lines to do this at this entire process it's not complicated at all so tensorflow is really designed for for people who don't want to I don't wanna say it for people who don't want to spend a whole lot of time coding but it's it's pretty easy to pick up so once you've pastured all your numbers in through this process you're going to come up with some kind of a mask that kind of tells you it's this is going to be a basic prediction this is an example of what your mask would look like and these are your weights the the redder it is the more likely that this is the character that you're looking at blue or it is the less likely this belongs to the character you're looking at so for each time you pass something through it you use this mask on it and or the the the the model will use this mask to determine okay this picture that I'm looking at fits this this character doesn't fit this character and it comes with a prediction of this is this is a 2 or this is a 7 or whatever it is as you're doing your training the first time you do it you're gonna get everything wrong as you continue to process everything through this through this model you're gonna get better and better and better and with tensor flow you can visualize how it's improving each time you do it and this is example of that how your loss function is improving over the course of your training and you'll see that it's actually pretty bad here and it gets smaller and smaller and smaller until you end up having a pretty good result all right so this is some these are some images that we that are taken from my lab this is a paper that a magar put out last year and this is a another paper that was done by somebody else the idea here is we have people who had traumatic brain and traumatic brain injuries and we're trying to identify area of areas of trauma what you do is you have a huge list of images of people who have suffered injuries and you know brains that are perfectly fine and you're trying to identify areas where things that pop out that are indicative of the injury this was an app done and tensorflow but it could easily be done that and and that it's something that labs should consider adopting this is something slightly different which is in angiograms where we're trying to identify these structures we're trying to pick out these structures from all the background and you can see that again this wasn't using used tensor flow groups but it was a a deep learning method that they was able to pick them out pretty well we can see them pretty well as a matter of getting the computer to figure them out okay so I've gone through this a little quicker than I expected but why should you learn tensor flow and this is really the bottom line I've been looking around lately and when people are asking for your skills they want to know if you've touched tensor flow before there are a lot of companies that are current you it part of it is because of the Google cached especially startups seem to have this idea that if they're using Google's product Google's going to come along and buy them and you know they can retire a learn tensorflow if you just put it on your on your CV it's gonna help you get your foot in the door and the other thing that surprises me sometimes when I talk to people in the department is a lot of us don't a lot of people don't know Python we know R or MATLAB or other things if you're if you're finishing a master's degree or a PhD in this program you get a no Python it's it's at this point it's it's a requirement if you're hoping to get a job outside of academia so if you don't know Python learn it markussi might be able to help that's all I've got sorry I went through through it all so quickly like it's like Kavon Kalyan is unfortunately not here today it's because he doesn't really care about his students that much he's missed the last couple of presentations from students he's out of town but he sent his apologies for not being I'd like to thank all the other lab members that have helped and who contributed some of the images we that I presented a lot of people in biomedical engineering gave me some feedback as far as the martial arts project these are machine vision experts and I appreciated their help Martin Bernard Martin especially and again thanks to the NSF for a pain yeah go ahead Marcus I I was just thinking you may have some examples of Medical examples of use and tensorflow that I could show if you'd like after you discuss you know because we have time and absolutely same show you'd like I mean I wasn't planning on it but you know I was just looking through some decks that I've got so you have to show some non-medical examples go ahead yeah you know just just to kind of get our mind going and what you can do with this thing would that be okay sir the examples you showed here for a lot of Supervisors examples or some of the medical imaging because we know that it is kind of like a semi supervisor of data set it played around with tensorflow know that there are these avenues but what about unsupervised or centralized sure tensorflow there's a lot of things in there that the biggest problems with deep learning is getting labeled images especially for medical imaging it's I mean you need sometimes millions at least thousands and thousands would be helpful there are some libraries out there that can help you train even without having that kind of image that requires having physicians that's game that's the big problem I mean when you when you're having when you have labeled data is somebody yeah but you need to have a human to label it which is I guess relatively easy if you're just doing numbers it's much harder when you're doing something complicated like medical imaging but I can't think about specific method and and tensorflow but I know they they do have approaches for unsupervised learning as well as a technicality of this because of tensorflow doesn't is the output image treated as a I don't know how why it would be if you're giving it an anonymized the first place yeah I'm not sure how to answer I guess a good example of this is doctors want work with the dream and the dream mammography challenge one of the big parts of it were you actually didn't actually see the data you saw what they call anonymize data hmm but for the long journey you can where it is data there are ways for you to get that output image and technically speaking as far as their guide language concern those were anonymized biomedical images therefore be really that's something I could look into that would be very useful to know you know it's um you know I've won one of my I don't have the answer to this but one of the things I am interested in is comparing the deep learning methods Alex with for image recognition you know with both the passport you transform men because there's a lot of similarities you know I mean basically you're just selecting on different spatial frequencies and the question that guess is when would there be enough spatial frequency your cutoff to satisfy you know that field of pH I which is medically imaging oriented you know that there wouldn't be an identifiability is probably a literature so it'd be something to something to look into so I I got this deck from Jeff Dean who is some did you look at the torch at all there there's other other things besides tensor flow out there um and you know arguable which is better which is you know a lot of a matter of choice the reason I would push tensor flow is again just the Google name it does carry some weight but it's not I mean there are other alternatives are these puts a pretty big name yeah yeah as much as deep learning is a hot topic these days there's some hot topics of that or tensors will have more generative adversarial work yeah I don't I think so right yeah I mean there was somebody I was I was listening to a couple of months ago who's talking about some of those advantages and pythor it would think that this point yeah at this point and I mean for anyone wants to learn more about why torture is just another library from Facebook we have a Harvard deep learning event coming up on November 18 and we will have a core developer of by George given the keynote visiting from Facebook where he will be talking about I've been to justify torture with tons of yeah do you think we got up in the mind inside to because we put money into it should be ya know it's really good there's been a kind of a discussion between this fellow Jeff Dean you know and it's been so I had this DAC which you know it's useful you know I was trying to come up with some kind of bone discussion for a company in Boston who had asked me to come in and Monday in there you know and just everybody wants to know what do you think about it intelligence so I was just kind of like dragging through and you know frankly it's something that's coming up you know kind of at the Health System level so you know some chair sends an email to me and doctor wrongdoing says well what do you want to do about artificial intelligence so you know and so yeah it's just collecting aback various backs decks and trying to come up with some kind of story and there's a tensorflow piece in the stack so that you know I wanted to give the attribution you know and we receive this into the lab June timeframe so it's a little dated in the first part of it you know deals with you know this slide here I had to think about for a long time actually you know and we talked about it in our lab meeting back just to kind of get through the philosophy of what these difference might be between machine learning which is a method that you just specialize the deep learning method might be a specialized version that in the artificial intelligence so that I could figure out how to describe this to you know our administrative leaders you know and actually it's some it's a pretty good thing to think about that the artificial intelligence is involved and you know trying to get a machine to make machine smarter as opposed to having a computer learned and I think that's a Cooper debt you know just kind of to hold that in the back of the mine now what I have to be useful for me and kind of describing this things to people you know and obviously people getting more interested and I'm sure that curve is wrong you know here's your cat I don't know how dogs lost out you know and I thought this so what one little personal story for me was that I was doing a lot of this research myself not for image recognition but for image compression data compression back in the 90s you know when I was just getting started in my career I had these neural nets it was really excited and I get DARPA going on it and so on and I got a call from the engineering college into the I remember vividly the call and this professor over there said I heard you're working with these neuron that you know and you need to stop doing that they're a black box you'll never get promoted it's a disaster don't do it I mean I'd quit I read I was just done stopped cold obviously we didn't have the computing power at the time I probably would died it but I took the advice and there's the point about this computing power and so that's kind of a kind of what's happening and you know there's your spatial there's there's your anonymized cat for your health record you know it's gonna smear them off a little bit you know the question is is a bit of use so now so let's just get through this and then this is I was really interested in learning more about it so I spent some time kind of drilling through and playing with little toy examples and the like on tensorflow because you know I'm part of it was you know this and there's the white paper which is useful to you know I download the data it's really useful to take a look at but you know it was kind of this which is probably a marketing slide right but you know it took off so it's something I'm glad you're bringing you to her attention because it's something we need to know about and I'm sure this Google caches got a lot to it and there's some of the other there's torch for example so I think that's gonna be fun to learn about I'm gonna try to go over to that myself um you know and you know and you I did you I did get a chance to go into this page and looked around you probably went in there too well that's the one thing I'd say another reason to go for tensorflow is that there's so much out there and it's amazing it's not I mean you know it's it's that the target came up with that just from developer from really users there's tons and tons of blogs and people are using this all the time yeah and so this is really was the point that I wanted to bring to our attention here you know I'm a solar power guy so this is a simple example of just trying to figure out you know kind of a look to see how many homes might be good for solar panels on the roof kind of thing you mean this is a simple example that day but the now we're getting into Medical which I thought was fascinating you know this this this was cool because we many of us worked on digital pathology for a long time and I thought this is a really particularly good example because it brings this whole multi scale so think about the idea is that what you'd like to do is ultimately in ecology and ultimately analyze histological images which could be virtual images in the pathology lab to move away from the idea of anatomic pathology including through microscopes all day making calls rare cells or something like that and so I what I thought the neat approach here was this you know kind of multi lens multi magnification approach that you know so you can imagine a new kind of microscope where you're just going all the way from you know water immersion or oil high power all the way to low power so you get your your field of view and then you could put this on a microscope stage moving around next thing you know you got a big virtual slate virtual side but you know what you have here which is neat is that you have the kind of nested inputs of the multi magnification which I think it's going to lend itself to the you know to the processing with the layers you know and so so that then they show the example of you know this is this is not microscope but this is medical imaging and you know the old the old approach the first generation was the pentatonic pathologist is trained the second one would be that you would have some kind of simple training set a lot of bowls of positives and not in false negatives as well and then using this kind of approach it's a needle in the haystack piece in one of the things that's advantageous for this is that there have been a lot of like human factors studies that you know there's you want your biopsy to come in and the pathology lab at 2:00 in the afternoon or 11 o'clock and orange or something like that because there is a fatigue factor that happens with the anatomic pathologist doing the readings this is there's no fatigue factor you know of this and so you know you're in you know and you can see that these numbers are these numbers are you know the American College of pathology which is the you know kind of you know the board that oversees the CLIA labs and everything like that you know you can't ignore these kind of numbers and the days of the anatomic pathologist are number you know the thing that's making the big difference is that it's a company called inspirati that has worked with Phillips to get microscope imaging machines into like anatomic pathology processing centers and so the FDA stamp of approval would come through the Machine and they would reach back into the software so we're going to see in the next five years or so all of this coming into the pathology labs in a big way okay this one here was I had a chance it's worthwhile I can leave leave the material with you this is a decent decent one to look at this has been you know this is next-gen first jet second gen was you know telemedicine take a picture of the skin you know send it to the dermatologist well this is now you have an image library trained it up send it through this you know neural deep neural network scheme and you know and read out the stages of the skin cancer you know take back this one I thought was really cool I hadn't had a chance to show show you guys this longer this is actually something that is it could be a dream for many of us who are trying to get three three-dimensional images of cells but are troubled by the fact that you have to do the fluorescent labeling and sometimes when you do multi labels you get into problems with the chemistry you know you one label works nearly all works you bring them together you do two or three labels they don't work so well together so here you could the other bright field stack that was unstained and related to the stained images say from 3d confocal but then impute the data back to the unstained specimens so in the end of the day you don't have to you don't have to stain them so you could use like a 3d face contrast or something like that and then move labels so you know here the nuclear you know and this is related to Alex's thesis and you know it's kind of makes you sick to your son I mean because we were having so much trouble getting these pictures and these guys are doing you know and these are the same kind of experiments we're doing in our own lab for reasons that are thought illogical development and proving out something and you know these during Google guys they're you know and if you look at that that's like day 14 of your we've got an experiment right now where we got day 1 day 2 all the way to day 14 we're looking at controls versus treated and we're turning terminal differentiated cells back in the stem cells and then over the terminally differentiated cells and looking at chromatin and everything everything inside of it you know we're doing all this labeling it's time-consuming it's expensive because the day if we could have a training set with labels and Gotha on stain and then do the mapping something like that now are there genomics big area lots of buried colors out there you know in this one I looked at I have maybe Tallinn or some of you experts know about some of these tools this is one that Manolos talents listen to all then you know him for you L&L katralla lanskaya is an old friend she was von Braun's mentor so these people are well known to us and this is a really pretty good either different paper so that trails flat paper would probably be deep sea would be my gas the Manolis Kellis paper I think we know that one pretty well too so there's there's a lot alex has got a brand new review article it's just about ready for submission where he's done a deep dive on machine learning and deep learning in in our area of pharmacogenomics and there's a whole table one in there deep learning applications and bioinformatics damn thing is two pages long and a lot of those are in here so this is this variant caller now part of this is really going to be pretty important for us why because Google has made this incredible investment into bioinformatics they wrapped it all off they put it into chrome and they're sending it out everywhere and we could pretend to ignore it if we want to but we probably don't want to ignore it and so we got to be aware of it and you know they've got the guy data they're winning prizes they've been I think you know that Burleigh is an alphabet company associated with Google so you got the broke the broad capability the barelly capability and you know what they're trying to show you you know so you know 98 vs. 99 you got to make a decision there too but these Google tools are taking taking on the taking on the best best-in-class and it's important to know because they they will conduct the good news is many of you could go work for them they pay good you know but I think you know the the point that I wanted to drive in on with the tensorflow is that we know if we know our peril because you know the west coast is coming and strong on us with brand new capabilities that are going to be part of our workflows for the future and so you know integration this is something that I think it's been out there for a while but it's happening that is in the old days you know think of the next-gen sequencing core and bioinformatics core two separate places well you know well you know Illumina and others are gonna fix that for you you know and I've been spending time down Abbey shiites and Jen it's the same story you know the the the company would like to like disintermediate the bioinformatics analysis by bundling the software with the in with the sequencer it's selling that as a wrap service offering you know because the the trend in the sequencing business is called the race to the bottom so you know the best the price of the genome you know approaches $100 say in the next few years it becomes mass commodity and so the private think of the profit differential and the sequencers are going to be in the analytics and not in the sequencing itself and so you're going to see all these big companies are gonna like merge their capabilities tightly in with the sequencers and they're gonna be sold as products together and that's going to be outputting analytics and you know already analyzed data into our hands instead of the data that we would analyze something to think about I believe that of course if you disagree with me I'm happy to disagree because I don't I'm just making this all up but I think it's true and then of course the bigger thing in healthcare I just had a very interesting conversation with this guy that about an hour and a half ago was over in learning and Simon TV's over learning on Sciences and he's working with people over and Malakar the new curriculum Kairat the deep in the model I grew from so anyway they're and they're trying to figure out what data science should they put into the medical curriculum and really should they draw the line and you know and there's all kinds of things now having to do with there's there's issue for example machine learning tools are coming into you know devices and you know are putting out output in driving clinical decision support so the question is what does the physician and training of the physician have to know about any of this and you know there's gonna be a big blur between you know as we try to bring in more phenotypic information from you know EMR and other sources and linking with the bioinformatics this is going to be ground zero for the next wave of innovation with you know machine learning and data science biomedical data science is what I want to call it right sitting in the middle of it so it's an extension of what we do and of course this is being driven by the outside because they see that's where the money is the vendors see that's where the money is there's extreme market pressure to develop this kind of stuff right now to answer authentic questions having to do with basic stock that would enhance clinical decision support like what dose of warfarin should I give this patient you know something that you would do in the clinic or you know outside like for example the guy was telling me that you know there's a big problem with high-risk patients being discharged from the hospital only to find their way back and readmitted in the hospital and that costs a fortune because with the current laws in hospital like us would be liable for that remittance charge and so what he told me about was because there's an algorithm that is it's called lace and it's run on everybody in the hospital to be a patient setting they just switch to that and so they switch on a learning algorithm it gives all your hospital patients and it alerts the docs and the nurses and the caregivers in every single room in the hospital who might be readmitted based on risk factors coming it's exactly what it is and what they want it until they might say you know you're a lot of cardiovascular medication but we're gonna send the pharmacist down and give you these pills because we don't trust it you're gonna go to the pharmacy and buy them and you know so it's a resource allocation mechanism to prevent the specificity you're absolutely right so everything from very basic all the way out to the border of the hospital and then beyond like for example in Livingston in Washington County you know emergency room utilizers are on a plus on distribution and you know a lot of the emergency room resources are taken up by a simple fraction small fraction of the repeat offenders they keep going back into the emergency room every day of the week for various reasons so you could run an algorithm against that data which we have and you know machine learning against that and identify it I'll need you know how much machine learning you me identify all those patients and inner being and try to figure out send us caseworker out there and try to figure out why they're going back in there and prevent them this is the kind of stuff that's happening right now either losing health care coverage yeah well I don't know so this so so you know this this learning to learn thing is you know something to think about in terms of artificial intelligence those are just a fraction of the some of the medical imaging pathology radiology bury cowards bioinformatics PHR out of the community everywhere you go I mean there is one there's one more thing that I think is really worth looking at let me see you think just to give you a feel yes I don't know how many people were tracking this personalized medicine World Congress people pmw see which is coming to Ann Arbor it's a couple things that are worth knowing in 2019 we're funding the artificial machine learning and medicine artificial intelligence and medicine conference that was in Boston it's moving to Stanford in 2018 in 2019 we're bringing it to an arm that is the number one conference for machine learning and health and medical research and health care in the country we're bringing that to Ann Arbor in 2019 August and we're gonna have a workshop at that point so that'll be good you know what I want to show you what the personalized medicine for Congress they are coming we're having a an event that started in Silicon Valley in San Jose years ago many of us go to that then they decided they wanted to settle there was one in Israel they open it up in Israel looks like franchise so then I stand so it was Stanford was associated with the first one then Duke brought into it now they're making the round stay in Arbor we're bringing them here in June they just sent out a you notice on this yesterday and I counted in the email approximately 200 companies that are involved in machine learning and in artificial intelligence having to do with you know all the way from basic all the way up to quite applied into translational new community companies that are involved in the space I mean it's huge and there's a little diagram and then I'm done and I didn't plan on doing any of this but I think it's maybe it was okay before so we're at that one thing I should have said when Tenterfield first came out a lot of buzz about it you know GPU use it's it's it's gotten to the point now that you can use it on mobile devices oh there was enters that is fantastic yeah look at this view this is blew me away I almost put that these tents are processing units has a hardware I mean this has gotta be some kind of like next-gen GPU or something like that but you know I think it's important to know that they are building thank you they're building boxes for this so what kind of concerns are there I know and specifically in the finance in the world of finance machine learning is very horn strong because the security conditions or whatever they require that the financial institutions are able to explain what is happening with their algorithms to their clients for transparency how does that translate in biomedical I really appreciate you asking this question it is absolutely the fundamental question I asked you know I certainly asked sarin deep who came in to meet with me a couple hours ago about this it's the right question you know I think the answer is that we would only go with the supervised learning and there has to be some way to look and see it's like yesterday sooner you know what are the feature vectors how do they relate back to you know something in the sour or something in the patient population that I can like interpret I mean this idea of this pill you pull up blinded hidden layer model or you push a button and out pops up Felix a cat you know I don't think it's gonna fly in this but it is that is the discussion that we have to have right now and there might be it's it's you know it's easy to kind of up with the answers and do policy guidance and kind of draw lines but I think in the end of the day if people are using a tool that are giving you answers the way we discussed it a couple hours ago it's like you're getting in a car and you're driving down the street you know you can you can drive down the street and you know you don't have to know anything about the car I mean you might know that it runs on gas or electricity or something because you might have to plug it into whatever but you don't really have to know anything about it so you know so as people get more and more you know used to using certain recommendation technologies in their work they did say something was pretty interesting listen this so there was this test where they would take the human there is it just a standard practice if you get blood to some buttons you would take a hemoglobin measurement before you gave a blood and after good you give them what a standard of care and it goes in your racks okay well there's a paper that's Justin's published that shows that you know with the hospital recommendation systems you know you'll have the phlebotomist and the physicians and the nurses and everybody and you know you take the blood and you do anemic right you know you send it down a lab you get in here and then the standard of care is that there's a box that you checked in the EMR you know do a lab test and everybody does a lab test select 100% compliance then somebody goes in this is the experiment that's the control the experiment is over you the computer room checks off the box so you've trained these doctors that the best thing to do is do the hemoglobin measurement after you you know do it before and after you've trained them and you've got it all doing it and they're looking at it and then you go to the back room and you come a box what do you think happens so the doctors continue to do the hemoglobin measurement after or not what do you think it looks like I'll tell you how it looks it looks like this sure it when they are told to measure it when they're not told to measure it they don't measure and so that's just one example so you got to think of the healthcare provision in the hospital say is a series of recommendations coming from a system and by and large what's happening is they're following the recommendations we're seeing this change yeah so that's why I'd say that you know on one hand you get in these policy discussions I had these like high-priced lawyers that were actually working in with security Exchange Commission and they were trying to like talk to the FDA this as well you think about that I was on the phone with these guys a couple months ago they were asking these questions you can come up with simplistic answers but what I'm saying is let's elect the automated cars I mean at some point you're gonna get like for me I got this big truck so if I could push a button and like get it to park this truck I mean I really would I mean am i ready to like get rid of this brakes in the steering wheel I don't think so but you know am I willing to take the first step yeah you know if it doesn't work yeah back up a little bit but I think as we get more and more into this we are going we get used to it we're gonna start trusting it so my sense is that our understanding of what's actually happening with lightly you know as consumers of things it's likely gonna decrease no matter what our policy directives might be so I think it's it's a very kind of freaky time for us is you know earthbound humans who have not had to deal with them that's this our job here is to learn it up about it so that we can contribute to its appropriate and ethical uses all right that's Mitch I came in to help did you know this was not plain but I hope that some of this additional information gives us an idea
