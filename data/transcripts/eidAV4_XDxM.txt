so thanks everyone for joining us for today's dcmb seminar um good afternoon it's a nice sunny day although a little bit chilly um here in michigan so today i am extremely pleased to be able to introduce our speaker dr kevin ward keviness from the environmental protection agency uh and unc uh so dr ward cavinus received his undergrad degree from tulane university in louisiana and his phd in computational biology and bioinformatics from duke university studying gene environment interactions and cardiovascular disease after graduating in 2014 he then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the helmholtz institute in munich germany studying the molecular mechanisms and environmental risks of cardiovascular disease and accelerated aging his folks postdoc work uh was very interesting and includes some very highly cited publications on meta-analyses of the dna methylation and transcriptional landscapes of aging currently his lab uses molecular specifically genomics epigenomics and metabolomics data and electronic health record data to understand molecular mechanisms of environmental exposures so these exposures include both chemical and social neighborhood factor type exposures and his work has been had a special focus on vulnerable populations he's currently pi of the epa cares research resource care stands for the clinical and archive records research for environmental studies and in this role he helps epa work with health health care providers to study air pollution and heart disease risk and other clinical endpoints using ehr data so without any further delay let's give him a warm welcome to today's speaker and again thank you for coming at least virtually to ann arbor to be with us today all right thank you for the excellent introduction and thank you all uh for the invitation to speak with you um pierre so as i said i'm currently a principal investigator at the environmental protection agency where i've began this research program although it's a continuation of many years of research that i've been doing up until now and i think it's really a continuation of the arc that environmental health is going where you're moving towards a more personalized and precision medicine world that really reflects the goals of genomics and public health in general so i'm going to begin by discussing electronic health records um in air pollution epidemiology and how electronic health records in general are really changing the way um that we do a lot of environmental studies or changing how we can perceive environmental effects on uh various vulnerable populations in particular um so to start off the talk i'd like to um orient a little bit to sort of one of the central ideas of environmental health that doesn't get discussed as much details i think it should be which is the idea that there are both a range of exposures and a range of vulnerabilities to any given environmental exposure much of my work centers around air pollution um specifically particulate matter where certainly where i do the bulk of my work these days however i think this is actually an applicable scenario to a wide variety of both chemical as well as non-chemical exposures such as social determinants of health and it really applies any time where you have um an exposure which perhaps for young healthy individuals who are going to prize the majority of an affected population you see fairly mild effects so in the case of air pollution the widest subset of the population is affected which are the generally healthy individuals i'm only going to experience you know fairly mild subclinical effects we call them such as lung function decrements inflammation and cardiac effects for that and the magnitude of impacts in terms of individuals be millions um but the overall magnitude of impacts to our public health or our health systems for there might not be as you know large as for other individuals um but as you move up the pyramid um and you get to smaller proportions of the population affected um in there um but you get to more severe health effects for it um then you start to move into things that we actually are studying in our mom that interests us in our typical manuscripts things like doctor visits um loss of productivity or school work and then moving up to er visits hospital admissions heart attacks and even death for there and death is responsible for about 90 90 of the monetized benefits from federal regulations like the clean air act and the cleaner act is you know widely known as one of the most economically beneficial federal regulations that exist in terms of its monetized benefit to the population however the discrepancy comes or describes the other see it when we know that death is generally only occurring for the most vulnerable individuals those with pre-existing disease or some environmental sensitivity to their particularly in areas of the country um such as north carolina where i do a lot of my studies where the air quality is generally very good um and below you know current national um standards for there but our studies generally are mostly composed of the bottom of the pyramid and so we aren't targeting our studies we actually quantify you know the health effects in the population that is experiencing those health effects for there and this may mean that we're both underestimating on the health effects within these vulnerable populations and we also may be missing very important health effects that simply aren't going to be seen in the general population but will be of great magnitude and a more selected more vulnerable population for there and of course this is you know of global interest not just united states interests um given that air pollution alone as an environmental exposure um is responsible about 3.3 million premature deaths um a number that's rising mostly due to uh continued poor air quality um in some developing countries um but um also rising due to the changing demographics of our population uh with the aging population we expect to be moving more people up the rungs of this pyramid and thus have a greater need to study the health effects in these specific smaller populations by the ones that experience the health effects that are of greatest interest to us from a public health sense so with that in mind um i think it's worth to understand exactly what it is we're going to i'm going to be talking about for the next few slides here for it and so now air pollution is a very heterogeneous mixture of both gases and particulate matter for there the common gases that we'll see in air pollution are going to be so2 co2 greenhouse gases and our sort of traffic byproducts um smog precursors um for their the gases that gave los angeles this sort of characteristic yellow haze um back in its early days um for there and has been prevalent throughout the hollywood movie scene ever since for it but then on the other side beyond the gases we also have the particular matter itself for there and this is a bit of a scaled image for you to understand just what we mean when we say find particular matter we were talking about very fine top scales whereas beach sand is about 90 micrometers and the human hair might be 50 to 70 50 on the low end there pn 2.5 is particular matter is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter for there and so at that size studies have shown that it's able to actually penetrate the nasal and upper airway defenses diffuse down into the lung from inhalation and from there set off a host of systemic effects mostly german by oxidative stress um a lot of it triggered by um some of the metals and chemical compounds that get adsorbed to the surfaces of these particles um and from they were able to observe effects not just on the lung but we now see particulate matter effects on everything from the brain to the heart um the kidneys even the gastrointestinal systems so there's really no aspect of human health that is not touched on by these fine particulates um so for the first study that i want to talk about it's an investigation that we did linking health electronic health records from heart failure patients with pm 2.5 exposure throughout the state of north carolina we did this to try and understand mortality and morbidity i mean them we did it in collaboration um with the carolina data warehouse for health which is an electronic health record resource that is centered at the university of north carolina and chapel hill uh for there so um we worked together with the carolina data warehouse um to gather electronic health records on about 40 000 um individuals who were diagnosed with heart failure between 2004 and 2016 um and then we combined that um we turned that into an actual ongoing resource now that we call epa cares um by linking those with a host of environmental exposures we began with pn 2.5 both from our epa ground-based regulatory monitoring system but also from some machine learning models um through some collaborators that we have that incorporate things like meteorology um satellite monitoring or aerial optical depth um which is the actual depth that a beam of light from orbiting satellites is able to penetrate um through the upwards upper atmosphere and it gives us a measure of the amount of particulate matter in a column of air for there and even land use regression variables like the street and roadway networks and the location of industries for their bomb and combine those into a high resolution um about one kilometer resolution spatial map of air pollution exposure data um now for those of you who are not familiar with cardiovascular diseases you may be wondering why we chose heart failure for there we chose that simply because it is one of the most growing and prevalent forms of cardiovascular disease in the united states unlike some other ones like coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease the prevalence of heart failure is actually increasing within the united states for there it is now the most common diagnosis in individuals that are 65 years or older representing about 1 out of 8 deaths and expected to affect about 1 in 33 total individuals not just 1 in 33 adults but a complete prevalence of about 3 in the u.s by 2030 and of course the health care costs are enormous uh for this disease costing about 30.7 billion dollars annually um projected to almost double over the next few dom or the next decade or so and so this is what our data looked like when we mapped our patients geographically for there now this is an electronic health record cohort meaning that all of our observations came through hospital systems um so naturally most of our density of individuals is going to come from the places where there are hospitals and generally they place hospitals in cities and so there's a you know over representation of urbanized areas although we do have good representation of some very rural areas i'm out here in eastern north carolina as well in the yellow triangles is the epa air monitoring network which we used in conjunction with our satellite monitoring our modeled air pollution data and you see there's a pretty good correlation between the two of those um simply because the epa also puts monitors where people are but so they happen to oftentimes be co-located in urban centers along with hospital systems and this is what the air quality looked like for north carolina now the top graph has a lot of bright red spots um throughout it we're looking at the annual average of pm 2.5 that fine particulate that's less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter for the year 2004 and then on bottom graph the year 2016 so the sort of bookend years um for our study there um and i mentioned the bright red areas because you know those are the areas of elevated um air pollution i'm in here but they are still very very much um near to the current epa standards so the most current epa national ambient air quality standards for annual average pm 2.5 um uh went into effect in 2012 um even back in 2014 the maximum uh air quality um 2.5 exposure that we saw in north carolina um on an annual basis was about 19 micrograms per cubic meter for there and in 2016 there are almost no areas that are above the 12 microgram per cubic meter standard so this is a wonderful state of study but because we do have some exposure heterogeneity across the state but we also are generally right around the border or below the epa's current national air ambient quality standards allowing us to study exposures that are at that level or below it which have some of the greatest public health relevance as we think about you know how to generate evidence under standards are both working or perhaps need to be revised so our first study was actually a study of mortality which came out back in 2020 just last year for it we began this work in 2017 when i joined the epa for there and you know if you've done any work with electronic health records it takes a little bit of time to get them together into where they're in an analytic ready frame and so we're really starting to hit the ground now with these studies our second study looked at hospital visits and readmissions and actually is the first study of long-term exposures and hospital readmissions for air pollution that i'm aware of um at least and so we decided on this for our second study our first study we just wanted something that we could understand validate you know what have been seen before for our second one we really wanted to push the envelope a little bit for there and because most current studies of hospitalizations are short-term exposures um we wanted to post books on a long-term exposure as well as bring into account some of the readmission time frames which are hard to capture if you don't have that continual electronic health record going on um so in the end we had about 440 000 visits from about 20 000 or 20 920 heart failure patients um for there we use a fairly standard actually a quasi-poisson regression model um adjusting for a range of confounders age race sex distance to the nearest air pollution monitor which is also a very good measure of urbanism um are there urbanicity itself that such as block group level um but year of heart failure diagnosis and some neighborhood levels socioeconomic status and county level variables um that capture things like access to health care um crime rates actual healthy foods other social determinants of health that might be important um as they co-vary both with marijuana exposure and with the likelihood of you know either being able to go to a hospital um in this you know have a visit recorded or have a readmission and we used inverse probability weights to try and add some causal interpretations for there as well as adjust for the competing risk of death in our models and this is what our study court looked like so our mean age is about 70 years old for their our entire study cohort as well as our inpatient admission cohort which also comprises a code of individuals that are eligible for our readmissions study we're both very similar in their demographics for their people who had at least one inpatient readmission did seem to be a little bit sicker than the entire study cohort have a few more total visits on there had a slightly but not really relevantly higher pm 2.5 exposure there and otherwise we're fairly similar not demographically and this is what we saw in our study for there um this is actually a ancient one so i use the term hospital visits uh most of the time in the literature when you see people studying hospitalizations you know in a lot of response to whether it be a molecular factor or you know a particular policy change or an environmental factor for their what they are talking about are inpatient hospital admissions um and the reason for this is that those are historically been a bit better recorded accessing the data has been more relevant for them and they're relevant for both short-term and long-term exposures as i said before most of the previous studies have been short-term on there but the vast majority of hospital visits are actually just outpatient admissions and i think outpatient admissions are particularly relevant because they give you an idea of how much is the hospital usage increasing how much is a person having to go to a hospital not necessarily for um something that results in an inpatient admission but just for general health concerns that come up in there and so this has been one of the first studies that really looked at the entire spectrum of hospital admissions including outpatient inpatient and emergency room visits and what we observed was you know not wholly unexpected um substantial increases in our overall cohort um our various subsets of our cohort are particular in the bottom so for everybody uh we deserve about a percent nine and a half percent increase in hospital visits per one microgram increase in pm 2.5 um for there um this went down slightly but was still elevated um even in areas that were below the current national ambient air quality standards um for there um we did note that visits were higher amongst higher income communities likely reflecting their greater access um to healthcare resources but were higher in people that had an earlier age of heart failure diagnosis um and we'll touch a little bit more on that a bit later in there we noted higher associations among african-american participants for their slightly higher um associations amongst the non-rural participants or individuals as opposed to our rural participants there um and a very strong difference since bisex uh which you're still working to understand um a bit more um now when we look to 30 day readmissions we notice a similar story at least with our overall associations a very significant increase there for it for the associations and about the 13 percent increase 13 increase per one microgram per cubic increase in annual average pm 2.5 um for it um if those numbers sound large to you um you know the average pm 2.5 in our area was about 10 um for it so one represents about 10 change um in there um it's also you know about one half of the iqr uh for our region um those numbers are large they are larger than honestly what we expected um for there and so what we did within our study which has been accepted for publication um it should come out soon um is we started to look at okay well you know what if we simply tried to recapitulate you know the study design that other studies have done that have looked at sort of pn 2.5 exposure and inpatient emissions on there we actually when we did that we saw exactly the same result maureen is uh you know maybe we ought to just email do you want to email him and just see if he can restart her yeah yeah maybe i wasn't sure if if i was frozen or if he was i know i oh my do you see it happening on like cnn you know or these guys but he just got frozen well it happens in uh meetings often yeah oh looks like he got kicked off so maybe i'll start up again interesting talk so far you know it's just um it's i really want to know more about that that difference between males and females was pretty pretty big yeah uh apollo there he is all right i am back i'm not sure how long i was gone there's a heavy thunderstorm going on outside my house oh no it's okay no problem if you're kicked off just come right back again and then uh good slides again the talk's going great keep going yeah i wasn't sure if if i was frozen or you were frozen so it happens to all of us yup all right let's begin again i think i was around the 30-day readmissions when i got kicked off yeah yeah you're on that slide on that slide okay so i will start the sharing again from there and i i think you you had presented a lot of it already i present a lot of it okay um so in that case the final thing i want to say about this this slide is that the one of the reasons why we were so interested in examining um this particular outcome is that hospital systems are penalized based on the number of access day readmissions for there this is something that's been part of the affordable care act um and has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in penalties applied to hospitals um based on the number of access 30-day readmissions so we view this as a way of really getting a broad body interested in environmental health whereby this is not just relevant for patients because nobody wants to be going to the hospital less than a month after they were just discharged but also hospital systems um who don't want to be facing millions or tens of million dollars in penalties um due to excess 30 day readmissions due to poor air quality in their areas and so we think this is going to be a really great means to give a broader cohort engaged on this very important topic so we looked at emissions beyond 30 days 30 day readmissions are relatively arbitrary cutoff choice um well although one that stuck around much like p less than .05 um has for there um but we see very similar patterns of associations the magnitude certainly changes um for there and i think most of that has to do with the baseline prevalence um seven day readmissions are fairly rare um for there um and we're where we sort of note the largest increase but also the largest standard error within there for it um 30 days look very similar to both 60 and 90 day readmissions uh in terms of overall magnitude so we think this is probably a fairly general phenomena for their not simply dependent on the 30-day cut off and for all of them we simply don't see associations below that 12 microgram per cubic meter standard so now having latest stage for that i want to you know talk a little bit about you know the power of electronic health records so i mean we can clearly see that we can for the first time study at scale you know vulnerable patient populations and you know i think that's you know worth highlighting again is that this is really the first study um that didn't simply examine heart failure patients as a subset of the general population um which is hard to do because with even with only two percent prevalence you can imagine the sample size you need to collect to have 40 000 heart failure patients show up for a cohort study in there and then given their general you know more severe health state it's oftentimes harder to get them in um into these studies but the electronic health records i think can go a lot further beyond that um it can even start to touch on some of things like gene environment interactions um so these interactions are actually quite prevalent um throughout the literature although there aren't you know very many studies of them um on there um generally if you look at you know major environmental exposure um and some cardiovascular disease there is oftentimes going to be at least some hint that there might be some genetic stratification to risk of exposure for there and i think we've seen hints of that you know even in the data we presented um here as i mentioned you know our associations were generally stronger for people who have a earlier onset heart failure for that that's oftentimes seen um as an indicator for genetic risk um in there generally the earlier onset of cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease in particular um the greater the genetic risk for it um and i think we see that also with our general sex differences i mean these can be you know differences that we saw between males and females which is our largest difference um certainly could be driven by you know patterns of activity at home versus you know being away for it or differences in exposure but it might also be driven by clearly underlying genomic differences be those you know genetic epigenetic or other factors that we need to understand uh for there um and i think some of the common challenges of gender vibe interactions are limited by you know the power you can tap into with electronic health records um the expense of genotyping complexity of the studies sample size out there i mean the studies don't get any less complex for there but i think there are ways to cover overcome some of the other two for there and while direct genomic information is being added to ehrs on the michigan genomics initiative being one of the premier sources of that for there it's not entirely common which is why we've now turned to family history because it's both commonly assessed in electronic health records and is a known useful indicator of genomic risk so for this study we looked at you know family history as an indicator for genetic risk for various chronic diseases we looked at cancer history cardiovascular disease metabolic respiratory and a few others um we examined both the binary indicator uh say whether there was a affected family member or not um as well as a family history score um created by summing the coefficient relationship for each affected family member um for that um and we used something a multiplicative interaction model that was layered on top of our existing approach needs a better uh more because it's essentially repeating can you mute yourself please sorry about that no problem um so we laid a multiplicative interaction model on top of our existing epidemiological model for third day readmissions and hospital visits um in order to understand if there was actually a statistical difference between people who had a family history of a disease versus did not in terms of their associate the association between pm 2.5 exposure and hospital utilization for these individuals um and so this is what our histogram of our sort of family relationships look like um up on the top here we have the frequency distribution of the coefficient relationship which measures the identity by descent for there so identity how identical um two genomes are in terms of their identity with a common ancestor for it sort of the formal definition also simply can be thought of as a degree of shared genetic um sequence between two individuals um four you know different family diseases here cardiovascular disease um and over your cancer for it and most people um so you recall we had 12 000 uh we had 20 000 individuals in there most people actually do not um have a fairly low family history of disease so 0.5 um which would be a parent or a child or a sister or brother i'm having it um but we do have people who seem to have a fairly substantial affected family history some coefficient of 2.5 um in there which would you know be equivalent of having you know two parents and perhaps a couple of siblings um and a grandparent or an aunt or uncle um who was affected um for their um cardiovascular disease was by far our most reported family history of disease in terms of the total you know the maximum coefficient relationship as well as the you know total people um simply reflecting that you know cardiovascular disease is a major risk factor for uh heart failure which is the population we continue to study here so this is a bit of our breakdown of our diseases uh you see 27 percent of individuals had a history of cardiovascular disease which replicates what we know based on the sort of family history of disease statistics that we see for heart failure patients but we see a variety of diseases of you know clinical conditions being reported in the family history um up there and this is what we see when we ran our interaction models for it so we looked at for total visits outpatient inpatient and emergency visits in this particular analysis of their the y-axis represents the actual interaction term um so this is the percent increase or potentially decrease that we've seen that but the percent increase uh for somebody who has a family history um as compared to somebody who does not um in their association with pm 2.5 so um recall that our baseline association was already relatively high at about 10 um to 11 um for their now we're adding an extra 10 relative not absolute magnitude um but still um highly relevant um for these populations um and very suggestive of the idea that you know this both that gene environment interactions can be uncovered using electronic health records and point in the directions that we expected greater risk with greater um genetic risk greater environmental risk with greater genetic background risk for these various diseases um and also can be seen across multiple health outcomes or multiple types of hospital utilization um there we really expected to see cardiovascular disease um we weren't sure we see we looked at other diseases cancer if anything was about as strong if not even stronger than cardiovascular disease i'm in there at least for total visits and really i think starts to speak towards the um sort of multimorbidity the interconnected systems that are at play here um now obviously if you're looking at this the first thought we should have is you know probably some type of linkage under the inflammatory system as inflammation is known to drive both cardiovascular disease and cancer and that's exactly what we hope to do by targeting some of these family history disease family history is a very crude genetic tool to use to uncover gene environment interactions although very useful as it's much easier to ask somebody what their family history disease is um than to do a sequencing project or even you know the latest illumina dino chip but it doesn't give us a lot of genomic region specificity or any at all for there and so the hope is by layering these and you know a lot of these have very very well mapped genetic risks loci we can start to understand potentially some of the genomic regions that overlap between cardiovascular disease cancer and some of the other ones that show associations and then use that to do follow-up targeted studies that may be more both economically and logistically feasible than trying to do whole genome wide association studies on uh hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of uh hospital patients um we also see these with our readmissions uh we didn't see it as strongly or at least not statistically significant if we're gonna uh use these p-val arbitrary p-value cut-offs um for it but we do see it you know fairly strongly uh with well with good precision for 90-day um as well as seven-day readmissions for it now percent changes here are huge um for there and i think it more reflects a bit more of the rarity of our outcome um when it comes to there um you start layering on family history of the ischemic disease um along with 90 day and seven-day or seven-day or 30-year 60-day readmissions um some of your cell counts get low um that gets reflected in our wide you know confidence intervals you know particularly if you look at the seven-day readmissions which ranges from like 20 to 100 in there um as well as you know perhaps a slight elevation um in there and the hope is that you know if we can we're working with other hospital systems now where we might be able to replicate some of these um and get a little bit more targeting and hopefully come a little bit closer um to uh under the the actual generalizable association effect estimate here um now i only have a few more minutes um for it about 20 more minutes um so the last sort of half of my talk um i want to go through epigenetic biomarkers which comprise a large part of my research as well and talk about them specifically relationship to their belt environment and health so we're going to switch tracks a little bit from thinking about air pollution and now consider the built environment which is very much connected to social determinants of health um as well which has become a growing aspect of my research program and a thankfully increasing recognized factor in environmental health in general so for me this research really picked up back in 2017 later in the year i came across a study of a life expectancy in los angeles county um for their um the first thing that jumped out to me is that los angeles county has really great life expectancy um at 82.1 years um for it to put that in perspective there are various states lifted here north carolina where i live down here at 78.3 so i might need to consider a change of address at the very least and if it la county were considered his own country it would have like the 11th highest life expectancy in the world for it um but then we juxtaposed that with the map on the right-hand side which shows that there's a pretty large discrepancy in life expectancy across what's a fairly small geographic area um you know l.a county is not the tiny city but when you're talking about something like life expectancy for there you don't expect necessarily to see such strong differences you know across these various areas um and you can even see it you know even more detailed if you look at you know very nearby areas um this is walnut park um in a neighborhood called kudahi uh walnut park actually has the highest life expectancy in all of la county at 90.5 years um so really a great place to live uh cootie has amongst you know the lowest or at least in the bottom you know quartile at least at 79.2 years and these neighborhoods are located only a 15-minute walk from each other there they have actually very similar demographics heavily latino neighborhoods similar age distribution uh similar incomes similar education um for there um the main difference is there's a bit higher home ownership in walnut park i suppose kudihi and then there's some environmental differences walnut park is named for a large park that exists that's sort of just off the screen here um kurihi meanwhile is boarded by the los angeles river which i believe is still used for some uh shipping for there and then this very large uh highway pier that borders just over the city um and it's opposed to a park uh cootie has a hudahi mall um which is located there which contributes both to traffic um as well as you know a certain lack of potential green space within there but then finally the city noted back in 2010 uh this assessment was done in 2017 um that illegal and hazardous material waste dumping was a concern within the city for there which to me points towards you know potentially environmental factors now even i as an environmental scientist could not expect that environmental factors could account for this larger discrepancy um but it can cause parts of it and my question is you know how can we study this you know at the time point at which you know it occurs it's a little bit too late um right now to start to fix it but can we start detecting it earlier um and if we start making interventions if we bulldoze kudahi maul and put in a giant part you know how can we say that those interventions are working on a time scale that matters to the people um that are living in the neighborhood and one of the areas i think that it's you know particularly useful for this is epigenetic aging so epigenetic aging is a means for determining the biological age of an individual or cell or tissue because you're really measuring at the cellular scale for their um using dna methylation specifically some of the alumina arrays the 27k the 450k and their newest their epic array which assesses 850 000 um dna methylation loci for their um it's been strongly linked with environmental exposures and health risks and thus may explain some of these links and importantly it changes on time scales that are particularly relevant and studyable on time scales of years months um potentially even days depending on the severity of the exposure that we're talking about and so it's a very useful quantitative biomarker that's more correlated with age than some of our historical ones like teal building and also more strongly associated with some of the health outcomes we're most interested when studying aging like the incidence of chronic disease and mortality um so for my investigation into this area i looked at the detroit neighborhood health study for it um my purpose was to understand if there was a link between neighborhood quality and some of these epigenetic aging biomarkers for there we looked at 157 individuals um compared you know a couple of models for their one with our sort of standard epidemiological you know adjustment looking at our standard confounders there and then another one that additionally adjusted for the perception of the neighborhood because this might be a very important confounder that's not present in other studies most people don't have a intrinsic perception of air quality they would like the air to be as clean as possible but if the sky is blue they're generally okay with it um even if the air quality might not might be you know worse or better for them on that day as it was the day before but with neighborhood quality we definitely have a perception uh variable that's important to capture and understand um and we looked at three epigenetic aging biomarkers and stratified on sex and then some neighborhood indicators of green space because green space has been projected of a very big salutogenic or beneficial effect on neighborhoods and so these are the biomarkers that we looked at one was the age acceleration difference sort of the original epigenetic biomarker aging biomarker the most commonly used certainly it's tissue agnostic which makes it very useful so it's composed of 353 epigenetic loci each of which has a weight um and you sum those up you multiply the weight by the percent methylation sum those up you get a measure that can be expressed in years and actually is valid whether you're looking at blood whether you're looking at brain or whether you're looking at skin or other factors there making it very useful for aging factor aging studies uh and then we have extrinsic genetic age difference this is particularly targeted towards the blood immune system so it correlates very well with some like naive cd8 t cells and other immune cell populations and then phenotypic age acceleration difference this one is constructed to correlate well with clinical parameters that historically been associated with aging things like glycemic control through glycated hemoglobin uh things like seer active protein which assesses inflammation um in there and some of the other lipid biomarkers that change fairly consistently with aging um to assess the neighborhoods we turned them we looked at 19 different neighborhood indicators which were assessed by trained assessors um on there so these people did not live in the neighborhood they were just recruited by the study um staff and then given a set of things so go look at everything from the abandoned cars fuel being on the street the presence of large mature trees um and then say you know what prevalence those were in these different neighborhoods um two of them went out and did each neighborhood and then those were averaged to create them we took them and did a principal components analysis because we know there's a high correlation amongst them and that's what you see on the x-axis of this graph here uh from pc1 through pc9 pc1 capturing the majority of the variation uh pc9 you know capturing a relatively small percentage of the variation um and we kept it at nine so because that captured ninety percent of the overall variation within the data uh which is a fairly common cutoff for principal components analysis and we did observe very strong association with pc7 uh interestingly so not our strongest one but actually uh association that we've now replicated using other epigenetic biomarkers it seems to be quite consistent for there um and the association was quite consistent across our three epigenetic aging biomarkers suggesting that um a standard deviation increase in this principle component was associated with two or more years of accelerated aging a quite substantial aging amount um and the primary drivers of this principal component were factors that are associated with neighborhood disadvantage abandoned cars people being on the street there was an inverse associated with alcohol advertising which you believe might simply point to the cheap land available to be able to put near there it might also reflect the fact that major highways are often built through disadvantaged neighborhoods and that's often times where you'll see highway advertising um is nearby you know some of these disadvantaged neighborhoods have cheap land and major highways cutting through them we saw positive associations with graffiti and the street being poor condition which overall points to a general socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhood that seems to be associated with accelerated aging across multiple biomarkers these associations do not differ by sex and we're not affected by the perception of the neighborhood so interestingly enough in the study most people liked the neighborhood that they lived in um for it um which is you know very very uh uh interesting phenomenon that we necessarily did not expect you know this is a study of detroit post economic collapse and still about 80 percent of the people both like their neighborhood and found it to be socially cohesive um these are also a long-term residence which also might obviously would clearly seem to correlate with that if you're a resident of a neighborhood for 20 years you're more likely to like your neighborhood but whether you liked or disliked your neighborhood did not seem to correlate or it seemed to affect our association on there and as i said our station was consistent across the sexes but much more precise amongst the females which is a phenomenon we're seeing a lot within here which we think might have something to do both with the epigenetic risk itself as well as potentially the relationship between neighborhood conditions um and women within these neighborhoods um in particular as opposed to the men within these neighborhoods um something that we're still working to understand in terms of social cohesion um and some of these other factors that might be playing a role now when we stratified on green space um phenotypic age acceleration difference was the only one who showed that showed a difference um as you see here and the difference was in the direction that we might expect um where for neighborhoods that had large mature trees um which was uncorrelated with pc7 um being a principal component it contains all the uh waiting for every um feature of the neighborhood within there but we assess the correlation between um large mature trees and pc7 as a principal component itself the correlation was fairly low so we weren't um worried about multi collinearity when doing this uh and if neighborhood had more mature trees the association seemed to be eliminated indicating a potential protective effect uh whereas hill stage was enhanced in neighborhoods that seem to have a low or below median is what i mean by low here amounts of large mature trees is an indicator of green space we also saw this similar direction of association with community gardens um we did a study of mortality biomarker um in here indicating that this green space effect might be prevalent no not just for large mature trees but for other aspects of green space um and i've got 10 minutes so the last two or three minutes i'll quickly walk you through what sort of flip side of the study so what i just showed you was that the built environment or the neighborhood conditions might accelerate aging within individuals who live in a neighborhood now we're going to ask the question well does accelerated aging make somebody more sensitive to air pollution or chemical environmental exposures for their this question we asked because chronological age has long been proposed and actually seen to be i'm an indicator of individual sensitivity to chocolate air pollution uh but chronological age is a you can't intervene on it you can't simply stop somebody um from aging um but biological age epigenetic age is potentially intervenable um they might be able to reverse it with either dietary or exercise or other healthy lifestyle changes for there and it also seems to be affected by other environmental factors potentially introducing a sort of vicious cycle where the built environment accelerates your aging which makes you more sensitive to future environmental exposures leading to health complications that might in turn accelerate your aging again making you more and more sensitive as it goes along um so for this we used a study cohort we jumped back to north carolina we had some really good environmental assessment data um available as well as some methylation data from um the caption cohort which is a cardiac catheterization cohort we used 12 by 12 kilometer model so we could attribute air pollution to different sources such as traffic um or secondary organic carbons we looked at various vascular outcomes peripheral arterial disease and blood pressure we selected these based on their prior associations with um near roadways which was the association i chose to study um in here both because it has strong implications for um neighborhoods as we said there's been a long history in america of cutting um through some of these uh minority neighborhoods with highways which overall tends to degrade the neighborhood um and increase the amount of pollution there for it and because in urban areas traffic light air pollution is one of the most prevalent forms of air pollution that we see our study cohort was sort of as you expected interestingly most of them had a negative phenotypic age acceleration as i said before this is the one that's based on clinical parameters um for there um but thinking you know here potentially is that because these people had a cardiac catheterization um a lot of them are going to be medicated um for things like you know glycemic control blood lipids um you know i want to say 85 of them are probably on a statin if not more um for that um which might artificially or not artificially which might serve to lower um some of these clinical parameters and that's the epigenetic loci associated with them and thus their phenotypic age um for the horvath age acceleration the sort of tissue agnostic one um we saw the acceleration that we sort of expected uh within there um averages to a highway is about one kilometer but gets much much closer um in urban areas um for it and these people had a little bit higher blood pressure than we might want um for there which is perfectly to be expected um these are what our maps of air pollution look like uh we focus mostly on the traffic sources diesel and gasoline um as well as our you know near roadways for there the road network is sort of shown in the black squiggly lines um here we also had a couple of what we call sort of negative controls biomass burning which you expect to be fairly low um in there um as well as um we want to see if this was a specific association for traffic air pollutants and this is what we saw when we looked at our study so we started very strong associations with peripheral arterial disease and age acceleration difference we saw by a slightly limit uh sorry we additionally saw associations with diastolic consistent blood pressure um for their uh diastolic blood pressure was the only one we saw um at the p less than .05 cut off at least uh that was consistent for our age acceleration difference and our phenotypic age evaluation difference when looking at interactions between near roadways um and accelerated aging on there all these associations are positive um indicating that for people um with accelerated aging their responses um to living near a roadway in terms of the increased prevalence of pertiful arduino disease um or increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure um are all positive which is sort of what we expected to see we could visualize this a little bit for age acceleration um difference release and peripheral arterial disease and it very nicely shows how individuals in our first tertile who actually had a slightly negative age acceleration difference and again they were slightly younger than their chronological age um seem to have no association or potentially even a protective effect um an odds ratio less than one at least um for there was our third tertile which has very large confidence intervals due to our you know pretty reduced sample size i'm in it we started with only 560 individuals uh but we still see a very strong positive association there um indicating that you know being the having the highest tier of accelerated aging um seems to make you the most responsive to traffic air pollution um and this is why we think that we might be on track here with uncovering um a potential individual level epigenetic biomarker um that can allow us to determine you know potentially you know as we develop these studies um you know individuals you know environmental health risk uh which is sort of you know one of the holy grails of environmental health research right now so with that i'll conclude um simply saying that you know electronic health records really have the sample size and clinical phenotyping um to empower novel studies and environmental health they can provide insights into gene environment interactions which we hope to leverage and utilize long into the future um and these epigenetic biomarkers really provide a unique window into understanding aging and mortality effects of the built environment and social determinants of health and accelerated aging biomarkers themselves might also serve as environmental sensitivity factors that we can assess at the individual level and that might lead us towards a more personalized or precision environmental health regime um and i'd like to acknowledge all the many many people who contributed to this work here and i'd also be happy to take any questions with the time that remains thank you that was a really great talk i have heard of the you know the studies with um epigenetic aging but i hadn't heard of these large cohort studies that are being done now to assess the relationship between that and all these um neighborhood environmental scores is that the detroit study that you discussed is that just an example of several studies that you're aware of that are being done using the epigenetic aging or do you think that's a fairly unique study oh no certainly not unique um you know it might be unique in the particular approach we took most people don't have you know trained assessors looking at a neighborhood quality for it but in terms of looking at the effects of environmental exposures on epigenetic age certainly not unique um and not the largest i've published you know several others on air pollution and other factors and there's a very rapidly growing web of research that's interested in the environmental drivers of epigenetic age and the sort of you know what i think of as the emerging tide of epigenetic biomarkers as we get these large cohorts where we can develop you know biomarkers for things like obesity or mortality risk or for even things like you know diet that might be environmentally driven yeah so maybe um maybe the michigan genomics initiative should be adding the the uh epic rates their list of assets the nice thing is is that you don't need the epic array you can be done with the 450 or the 27k array depending on what you want to look at so it's a quite flexible biomarker that's proven you know really useful for aging research in particular yeah um so if anyone else has questions you're free to unmute and ask or you can type them in the chat okay i have a question skill thank you very really terrific combination of studies you've presented today appreciate you speaking with us um i'm interested to know whether your own work or your colleagues work has identified any particular molecular sites for these many methylations like 300 that are quantitated in this epigenetic aging parameter is there parallel work or complementary work that's uh identified some of these in sort of the name of pollutant specific signatures yeah there actually there is work that's been done on that um for there i mean all the sites are you know listed so you can go and you can look up all of them um they seem to be mostly related to phosphorylation and cell clock regulators as we might expect for an aging biomarker interestingly i've done this and i assume others have also if you break it apart the associations get very very much diminished for there and so you see very strong associations in aggregate with the aggregate marker but not as strong with some of the individual loci i think there's only been one study i've done where we actually saw associations down to the individual locus level um for there so it really seems to be a holistic quantitative biomarker um in itself that's not you know necessarily strongly driven um by one side of loci or the other for at least the space of exposures that you know we've examined here um now i think there's you know potentially very good reasons for that um i don't think it's a causal biomarker i don't think that changing somebody's dna methylation age as we're currently assessing it would cause them to age faster or slower so i think it's reflective of other cellular processes and that those cellular processes are what we actually need to use this as a biomarker to target and investigate and there's a lot of research going on in that um as well for it but certainly you know it can be decomposed and look at its component parts and they will show association but generally much weaker than the overall biomarker will and probably lack reflecting the fact that you're looking at something that's only slightly correlated with a more causal cellular process that's actually you know the causal aging process involved in whatever outcome or exposure you want to study thank you thank you so we have a question on chat very interesting talk i wonder how family history variable was modeled it ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 was it treated as continuous uh yes good question in the slides i presented that was our binary model where we simply modeled whether they had one family member or not um the family relationship only went down as deep as cousins so um you know we didn't have like second cousins or third but you know those are fairly low sharing for it we also looked at it continuous and saw pretty concordant associations not identical there were some differences there but from some of our primary you know outcomes like cardiovascular disease family history the associations both pointed in the same direction um for it um and so we see similar stories whether we treated binary or continuous so you've talked about um you know kind of two types of studies like linking the environmental exposures to epigenetic aging and then epigenetic aging to to outcome have you considered doing like a mediation analysis to test for the mediating effect of epigenetics linking those two yeah we have considered that we're actually working on a couple of studies that approach that um exactly um the first set looks at you know the mediation of um epigenetics by various intermediate uh clinical phenotypes you know epigenetic aging is associated with mortality but it's not like that's what's killing the people so understanding the intermediate pathways through which it might um go and then using those intermediate pathways to determine which environmental exposures might then be some of the primary mediators um for that um and so we're at the first stage of that now but that is um certainly a direction that we're going and i imagine that other labs are going to it um as well yeah that the life expectancy difference between those two l.a counties was was really striking yeah will you get the chance to look at that in the detroit study or do you just not have that information um i hope so um you know i would love it if the city of detroit would do a sort of life expectancy or map like l.a county did because then we could connect that with our participants and look at who lives in the highest life expectancy areas versus not and then you know get a more direct tie-in for it in general i think you will see a similar story in almost every major city um across the united states maybe almost any you know decently populated area um even where there are going to be life cycles hopefully not as stark as we saw there but some and so my hope is that we can get some of that data generate a similar map for an area where we have really good data like north carolina and some of our other cohort centers and then use that in the future but it is something i would like to greatly explore since it was so startled i would guess that somebody would have that information we'd our um emily center does some work in detroit but also wayne state university their peers center i don't know if you're familiar with that they're in detroit so someone if you contact someone in their care center they might be able to connect you with someone with that information okay great yeah no i um not familiar with that center but i will certainly uh look into it in the data they might have i uh i really enjoyed your talk and you you were bringing up that the the epigenetic mark is sort of like a summary score of multiple ones which you can't untangle i wonder this if there is a same situation about air pollution i mean you're talking about pollution as a very general term so any way you can untangle let's say pollution from traffic versus pollution from uh production facilities or from all things nearby and i assume you would need to compare across country cities you know some places have a lot more traffic and less uh pollution from from production facilities and other fast places may have a lot of uh production so is there any idea that we know what what it could be in the air pollution um yes actually you can look at that so um so this is an expanded slide that i showed before you know where we're looking at the interaction between um various types of pollution um and uh accelerated aging and their effects on you know peripheral arterial disease here in this slide that i included and we can see that we can you know see associations with things like diesel generated pm gasoline that are stronger than our proximity to roadways indicating we're getting closer to the lycle acting pollutant there for it um but not as much with biomass or second organic carbon what you need is a really good model for the air pollution sources which is very hard to do and you need a very large population to try and actually decompose that because they are generally so highly correlated with any one area that requires large sample sizes and really good um quality assessments so it's something we're starting to get to be able to do and we have a couple of studies now that are doing that with some of our newer air pollution models but in general it has not been possible in the past wow and having lived in china it feels like this needs to be done there because i think what you gave as average like 17 of the pm 22.5 it's like two orders of magnitude lower than what they i mean they they have generally anything below 100 is very very rare and so yeah i i have been in 950 as is the highest i've experienced so it must be a horrible thing the question is whether they can actually get at that yeah yeah well i mean yeah those sort of scenarios are things you only see in wildfires here um you know we never see above the hundreds 900 is a lot of monitors don't even go that high um that we have here so well i i don't think i'm not saying 900 as average oh no just like i've i've looked at some of the data out of the you know it's on the china monitors and they are very very high on you know some days and um you know i think that's made it an interesting place to study particularly in these times we had effectively a global pandemic pollution control that shut down traffic and factories and so there's been a lot of interesting studies on you know pollution reversal that have come out of there because they had the greatest magnitude possible almost on the planet where you went from extremely high to very very low um particularly for something like the noxious gases from traffic pollution yeah i was wondering this goes back to the very beginning of your talk do you know what led to the great decrease in pm 2.5 levels from 2004 to 2016. and are those changes true across the country or are they specific to north carolina oh no those are across the country for it and it really was the epa's new national standard that came into effect um for there so the epa instituted a new national standard um and the national standard isn't exactly tied to the annual average there's a lot of caveats in there but in general it forced you know states and regions to sharply reduce the air pollution so the north carolina changes aren't even as great as they you know were seen in other areas because north carolina generally had pretty good air quality even beforehand for it so you saw some areas that went had even more drastic changes in air pollution than north carolina did driven by you know the fact that epa would have been handing out potentially large fines for areas that were out of compliance um after 2012. that's good so they're making a difference well thank you very much for your talk um we really enjoyed it and um sorry you weren't able to to come in person maybe some other time yeah perhaps another year but uh thank you for the invitation it was a pleasure to speak with all of you yeah me too look forward to continuing the conversation have a good one it was fun bye-bye thanks maureen for getting it set up
