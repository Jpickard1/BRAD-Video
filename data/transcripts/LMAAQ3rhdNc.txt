about transcriptomes replication and de novo CNB's and how they all tied together and very interesting story so take away all right thank you very much so yes I agree with the sunlight and I didn't touch Ryan because he tells me he's sick so I'm not so this is my long title integrating transcription replication and de novo CMV data which is meant to sound like bioinformatics hopefully we'll get to something y'all can sink your teeth into and mechanisms of genome instability so that's a very long title so here's my short title when worlds collide and my high-impact visual for you to appreciate why we were waiting so so what do I mean by when worlds collide so this is what you were taught in school and for example if you take Human Genetics 5:41 which I now direct you had one day that you came in and we told you all about this process of transcription which starts at a promoter engages in possessive synthesis of RNA copying one of two strands and then you took an exam and then you came back in another session and you learned all about replication and the bi-directional spawning of helicase is moving in opposite directions and leading and lagging strands and all these wonderful things about and then you took the exam and everybody was happy but what we were afraid to tell you is that these things all have to happen in the same nucleus on the same template okay and that that creates problems for the cell and that it has to be able to deal with and that I think you can appreciate entitled and when worlds collide now I have to recognize that there was a pretend marine biologist who was actually the first person to recognize the problem of world colliding and he had the famous line and George divided itself cannot stand if we simply change that to genome I think you can appreciate the the problems a very prescient analysis and then I need so ok so with that as a way of introduction to the general topic we're going to be getting at I'm going to tell you the following stories today first I'm going to tell you a story which is a replication story about copy number variant formation in the human and mouse genome then we're going to switch for a time period which is unfortunately to be too short in the talk I'm not going to have time to do justice to the Bruce seek nascent RNA sequencing project but a transcription dependent story and then we're gonna have these world collide in the description of genome research paper which came out online at the end of last year and impress sometime in the last month and this is gonna be the lion's share of what we'll be talking about to lead you through the mobile informatica galaxies in that paper and then ultimately think about what we've learned in this for and its implications for human disease and cancer so okay with that outline let's have a little bit of introduction on copy number variants and in this audience especially with Brian president I imagine that you've heard a lot about copy number variants but nonetheless let's try to set the stage for specifically how we think about for certain parts of this problem so what is a copy number variant well in the golden era when microarrays were enabling the first passes of genomic genome-wide analysis of for example two randomly selected human individual Thuringian Watson we could realize that there were regions of the genome in which they didn't have the same copy number and that in fact this proves to be very common in the human genome so that we see these kilobase to mega base gains and losses at high rates and there's tens of thousands and I started putting an X here because I'm tired of trying to keep track of Ryan and how many of these things actually exist in the human you know at this point and sort of commensurate with that as this fact that there's a reasonably high one to three percent mutation rate in meiosis so this is a substantial cause of variance in the human genome and of course because they're large they're affecting a lot of the genome and I'll emphasize in a minute that these are important for human disease biology but to set the stage for that we need to think briefly about the fact that there are two main flavors of copy number variants I'm so called lis current and non-recurrent copy number their answer I want to just briefly explain what we mean by these terminologies because they certainly can get confusing recurrent seeing these are those which a her between two segmental duplications or extended homology repeats within the genome and so by a process typically non-homologous non allelic um a logical combination in meiosis these two large blocks of homology drive a recombination event and the reason we call these recurrence is because when you sequence or look at the final product that occur arose in a series of different individuals the mutation result is exactly the same you could not tell them apart one individual or one mutation to the next because they're occurring through large blocks of homology contrast that with today's focus on non recurrence seeing these which are effectively defined by the fact that the end points of the copy number variants are dispersed that as we look at one or two or three individuals they will each have distinct and distinguishable mutation arising through processes which we'll talk more about in a little bit but because these are non recurrent does not mean that they can't be occurring repeatedly in the same locus of DNA so in fact we do in fact what the taste topic is going to be substantially about is the Racal that Martin's gonna laugh at me it's very hard not to call these recurrent non-recurrent but they're repeated non-recurring seeing these that are arising and here's one example in the oddest two gene which is just a nice review of the myriad of oddest - copy number variants that have had been observed in human individuals and associated with autism spectrum disorder intellectual disability and the like and again just at a glance you can tell that these are all different distinct private if you will mutation that arose but are nonetheless all within this gene and because of the nature of the patient population of course there may be a selective aspect to this so that's in the germline these are all inherited in the germline there's also the acquisition of this category of mutations in the somatic lineage in particular we're going to think about cancer here briefly so this has been an ongoing analysis in cancer for quite some time analyzing this is work from Sally Malik here at Michigan looking at CLL where he characterized what early on were not called copy number variants they were just deletions of genes and all the blue lines here indicates spans of deletion but again you can appreciate that as you go down the line they're all different and non-recurrent deletions that are nonetheless overlapping in certain regions of the genome which are then of course assumed to have functional importance so both in the germline and in the somatic many we can see clear evidence of this process of repeated non-recurrent C and V formation that has clear implications for health so we want to understand something about the mechanisms behind this process so I do this I'm going to tell you these couple of stories and the first story is the one that starts with work from Martin aural he's now a lessor track faculty member working in Tom Glover's laboratory and Martin was the one who really established this cell system I'm going to tell you about on the next slide Irene Park and others in the lab have contributed in ways we'll try to mention it go along so what Martin and Tom developed and had done before I began at this now very long collaboration working with them on this project is to establish a cell system in which normal cells in this case normal human fibroblast so carrier typically normal turd immortalized in most of the studies we're going to be talking about our grown in culture and treated with various agents and allowed to recover and then plated for single single clones which are then expanded and subjected to relatively unbiased genomic analysis when I say relatively unbiased what I mean is we don't believe it's a lot of phenotypic selection going on events are typically going to be heterozygous obviously some things might be deleterious and lot and the agents were going to treat them with are largely going to be replication inhibitors which is where we get the replication link in this story fit a colon as a DNA polymerase inhibitor hydroxyurea is arriving nucleotide reductase inhibitor and so the indirect inhibitor of replication by altering nucleotide pools in the cell so we go through this process and establish clones and we analyze them for their C and B content and the studies I'm going to be telling you today almost all of the data has been generated by snip or array CGH microarrays so this is a slide to just show you what these look like so I've over plotted in magenta a cellphone that was analyzed compared to in blue its parental cell clone so it just makes it very easy to see that there's a de novo C and B that formed in the clone that was not present in its parent one of the main reasons I show this slide is that it's very easy to find that this is a bioinformatics group finding these within the bioinformatics data would not stress even any one of you this is very easy and there's a reason for that and that is that these are fairly large okay I also will just before I make that point I'll just emphasize that this occurred in the gene and if you're thinking about the scale here that's a pretty big gene so keep that in mind as we move along so I said these are easy to find because they're pretty big and this is a slide to help just briefly talk through the issue that indeed where we don't believe that this is a detection bias that this really is the size distribution of these is fairly large with the median size of in this study and this in this slide at the time it was presented 186 KB but generally in most studies hovering around that 200 kilobase mark and the reason I want to just emphasize that we don't think it's a selection bias of course we do have a lower detection limit in the microarrays but first of all we're seeing a clear drop-off in frequency above the threshold of where we actually can detect CMV so that's point number one and also we have analyzed the subset of this clones by next-generation sequencing and we didn't see the appearance of a whole large class of much smaller events in these clones that we analyzed and so we don't really think we're missing that many in in this lower size range and those of you I don't have it plotted here but if I were to plot population C and B they don't show this pattern they show a different pattern where in fact things become more and more frequent as you get to smaller events so this isn't the same as what you see in the germline but again these are these are relatively unselected in the cell experiment system they are however very typical of the size range in what you see with pathogenic scenes which of course is why we're interested all right so what I tell you other things about be seen is the first one that sort of been implicit in what I've been saying but I'll just say it out loud they are induced by these replication stressors so we see a nonzero rate of seeing V formation with untreated cells so if simply growing cells in culture you will see the acquisition of de novo copy number variant but the frequency is clearly increased with both Levitical and hydroxyurea based replication stress and that's a lot of work mostly from Martin on this slide and sorry Martin so the other thing I need to tell you about these is that like essentially all of the Sienese in this non recurrent class what we see at the junctions is little or no micro homology but no extended homology so this for example is a blunt ended junction here are two short micro homology junctions this is a small insertion this is for people you know when we do this this is garden-variety it's sort of a running joke in the lab let me guess what did you see micro homology it's this is so boring after a while this is what you see in human germline variants which we see in pathogenic variants and it's what you see in ours and it establishes this idea that first of all this is part of why they're the non recurrent class but also suggests that they're arising by non-homologous repair magnet so what does that mean we're not going to spend a lot of time thinking about repair mechanisms that's not really the subject for today's talk but let me just first of all tell you that you can imagine that's happening by an end-to-end rejoining process where breaks are being rejoined by mismatching end and just you know as we say in the end joining field sticking the ends back together we don't actually believe this is the predominant thing going on and I'm going to reasons on this light the first here is just to summarize again one of Martin's elegant long studies that we tested this and they don't require EXO CC 4 which is a non homologous anyway gene and so it doesn't appear as though they're going through that pathway the other thing that we can see though is the occasional appearance of what we're going to call complex this is just one example that was analyzed by both micro as well as sequencing here and without going through the details of the slide we can see that this event can be described as a continuity at the genome that precedes in this direction has a junction that jumps here copies that in the reverse direction as the second inversion Junction and then continues on so there are two junctions in a single event in this particular cnv and as a result of that it's hard to describe that by an end joining process but it's relatively easy to describe it by a template switching process in which a strand has moved for example from a replication fork and literally jumped to a different replication fork and if we simply allow that process to repeat we could easily form two junctions within a single cnv their ideas principally described by Jim Leske and colleagues so that's all I'm really going to say about the sort of DNA strand based mechanism the rest of the talk is going to be driven at the question of why would this be happening what are the substrates and how can you describe where these things might be coming from and to get there we're going to have to think about yet one more property of these C and V s and that is where they are in the genome and what their distribution in the genome is so our are seeing V sets by our standards are huge because we work very hard to identify any one of these in our experimental cell system by human genomic standards these are of course small numbers compared to the many thousands that you could study but this is what we've got and when we spray them around we look at where they are in the genome we can see first of all that they occur everywhere there doesn't seem to be a particular chromosomal anything missing and they're out single pin and so on but then there are obviously other Llosa in the genome where they're clearly clustering and I'll show you this in more detail on the next slide now to amita genesis scientists like myself this concept of having of querying mutations and then seeing that they occur in a lot of places but that there are certain hotspots this is what every mutagenesis experiment in the world looks like but the question is what is the basis of that that hotspot now one of the things that's true is that most hotspot type mutagenesis they are looking at a very small and restricted scale often to the base pair that this base and in fact you can see these signatures of non random mutagenesis happening in the human genome at a base pair level but these I want to emphasize are not they're a much much larger scale phenomenon are C&V themselves are hundreds of kilobases right so the clustering of B occurs over the scale of one to two mega bases of the genome so this is a what we are we the words we like to use to describe this is this is a regional hotspot of you know this is a very large chunk of DNA bigger than the chromosomes of many species okay so that's what we're seeing now what might be describing this regional property well my argument has always been we need to look for something that is itself big well the obvious candidate is genes genes can be big so is there a correspondence in these two gene here we're showing one of our hotspots in the oddest to gene which I mentioned earlier so indeed much like the human patients we see a clustering of CNB's would show a very nice correspondence to the oddest two gene so that's very interesting and very exciting but we also see other hotspots like this one at 3 q1 3 which is actually the hottest spot in our fibroblast cell data and it's adjacent to this 600 kilobase gene called lsamp but the bulk of the Seavey's do not appear to occur in that gene and so that was one of the types of datasets that gave us pause as to how much how good this correlation with genes really was now the other thing I need to tell you about is a different kind of different manifestation of this clustering of chromosomal instability events and this is the phenomenon that actually led tom glover to do these studies in the first place was the phenomenon of common fragile sets so what is a fragile state so you take cell you treat them with replication stress is like a bit of colon and what you do is you make metaphase spreads of chromosomes and you can observe if you're Tom or Martin not if you're me you can actually say that's chromosome 3 and in fact I know which band of chromosome 3 that is and you can tell that it happens repeatedly in the same place in the chromosome and for us and 3b are the two of the hottest spots in the lymphoblast cell types and that these are these are typically done in so the idea is that the copy number variants might be associated with these self-same sites of preferred breakage so is that true well cross 16b in jean w wox a large 1.1 mega base gene in fact it is true we do have a CMV hotspot at that locus however brought 3 B in the pit large fit gene is not a site of CMV formation in our studies and if you maybe think maybe paying attention here you'll realize that that's chromosome 3 in that chromosome 3 well this cluster on chromosome 3 is not have not been described at the time that these studies were being initially being presented as a chromosome fragile site so we had clear exceptions to the rule that were really quite bothersome than trying to figure out what these connections were so the secret to that was mods Jungman so here's the second part of the talk is thinking with people studies that I've been doing with mods which initially weren't really executed with any thought process of this other thing I was doing with Tom and this is a part of the sense of world colliding is that we realized one day that we were actually studying the same problem and so what mods has been doing and that I've been helping on the bottom maduk fandom this is looking at Bruce eek technologies for nascent RNA sequencing so what is what is this and again I'm gonna have our too little time to go through the power of these very elegant technique but the concept is this that we're going to take bromo urea which is a rival nucleotide analog which is going to get incorporated into nascent Lea synthesizing RNA and we can do various things to this I'm not going to show you any data we can actually pulse chase this but what I collected I'm going to show it right here so if we pulse chase this we can actually look at RNAs which are now 6 hours old this is somewhat like looking at mature RNAs except they're not mature are not all mature RNA it's six hour old RNAs but they have been processed which is the point so if we look at that signal magenta we see that the signal nicely points all up to the exons of this gene as you would expect if we however harvest that RNA immediately after labeling what we see is a very different pattern the signal is now diffusely distributed throughout the body of the gene without respect for exons and introns because it is nascent RNA and I choose this example gene on purpose because you'll notice that there is no signal at they suppose it's in the annotated first exon of this gene we do see an exotic signal here and we see signal and the introns with the nascent RNA across the entire span so we learn something about the transcription of this gene in the cell type that was understudying this particular incident now it would be nice if we could absolutely definitively establish that there were a motor there so we have another little trick that again all this is sort of matzah baby they figured all this out but that if you take these cells and you via radiate them immediately prior to the bromine exposure what you do is you create blocks for the progression of on it limb erase and if you think about this for long enough and if you've watched matzah strain analogies you'll figure out that what's going to happen is that new initiation keeps pushing into these blocks you will get an accumulation of the signal at the point where transcription is starting and so we get this is the same data from the nascent RNA if we take the nascent RNA with the UV block we see that it accumulates right at that predicted point of transcription initiation so that's the basic suite of techniques and just to give you just a few slides about the flavor of this a couple of which will set the stage for what we're going to see in the C and V studies we can do lots of things with this so one of the things I want to emphasize is that this is a vital process which is to say we're treating live cells we don't have to harvest them we simply take the cell treat them with the agent and harvest the RNA from a cell which is living and doing all of its proper stuff so we can do lots of things like look in induction in this case this is an ionizing radiation treatment and what we can see is the clear and obvious induction and one of the things that's very nice about this is first of all we're looking at transcription not RNA it's a subtle difference but a difference and we see signal across the entire integrated across the entire body of a gene and so we can come to very high degrees of confidence about the changes in the transcription state of a given gene based on that and this is a three-fold change and I hope you can appreciate with replicates looking like this we can see much less than a three-fold change we can easily go below to fold in terms of looking at induction state and I don't think I'm going to show a slide I think I pulled it out but you can imagine that based on a timing basis we could also see how far that transcriptional wave of induction had moved down anything within a certain period of time just as a sort of a reference control you can see this gene I like this combination here because that gene immediately next door is not induced at all so we can expand that to lots of studies and this is sort of echoing what we're gonna see as being important in the cnv studies in just a moment that we can look at the existence of these isoforms so here's the actual annotated refseq annotated version of this gene which I apologize forgot to label here and we can see that there are is evidence for a couple of different isoforms which are being differentially utilized that the long isotherm is present in this screen but is actually much more prominently expressed than the other strand these are the kinds of things that we can do on a genomic basis now that's I think much easier than doing with actual nascent RNA because we look at the transcription so and the last slide I'm going to show here is just a little bit of an advertisement for a study that we have submitted looking at one of the values of this UVA radiation capture technique so what we basically think is happening is that we're capturing these transcribing RNA polymerase is on the DNA by putting this block in front of them and the consequence of that is that the RNAs that they're transcribing becomes stabilized if they were going to be highly labile and one of the really interesting classes for this is enhancer artists so RNA is being transcribed from enhancers it turns out that we see a potent stabilization or detection of the detection of these RNAs and this is the well described boss enhancer you can appreciate bi-directional transcription coming out of this enhancer this is of course a particularly nice looking example but we nonetheless can analyze this data on a genome-wide basis and and have high hopes that you can actually stratify enhancers by their functional utilization by this type so that's just a few little tidbits of what weird what we're seeing in the brew seek data but now we have to get back to today's main topic and get back to this question of worlds colliding alright so what do I mean again come back to this so we have this set of sort of connections between genes that we're seeing copy number variants and common fragile site but it's been a little bit murky and so the answer to this is going to be transcription perhaps not surprisingly because genes are transcribed but nonetheless this is something that has to be demonstrated all right so here's the demonstration and the title of this slide isn't read because if there's one thing you remember from today's talk it's read that the CMV hot spots an uncommon fragile site correspond to large transcribed genes this is our central observation and again it's in some ways it's obvious but it needs to be demonstrated that in fact it is the transcription of these genes that's the critical property so I'm going to give you all sorts of evidence but let's start with anecdotally just a couple of first example some of the hotter spots and mouse and human and also I haven't really told you about our studies in mouse embryonic stem cells but we've done this in more than one species in more than one cell but so if we look at the clustering of seeing bees we're going to and then we look at the transcriptional profile where it mentioned this yet but negative deflections on the curve mean that they are transcribing in the reverse direction and negative deflection on the cnv scale reflects that they are deletions not duplications or amplification and what we see is that there is a nice correspondence of this population of seen bees with that transcription region same thing here and this is actually replication data for now you can look at it or ignore your preference but we'll talk more about the replication part of this in a moment what I want you to think about briefly though it's just the annotations down here and what I can tell you is that when we started these studies a lot of these a lot some of these long spans of transcription and then I say lon you got to understand we're talking about mega bases these are these are two mega base fish sizes of transcription and some of them were not annotated so at the time that we paired this light the ensemble annotation still did not have the annotation of this very much longer paisa form of this otherwise very small gene beta it actually is in the annotation now and the same thing happened here that lsamp a gene I mentioned earlier and I told you it was six hundred kilobases well we discovered as did others apparently since it entered the ensembl annotation that in fact there is an isoform of this gene which adds i forget exactly how big the intron is but it's something like a 1.6 Megabass intron really huge expansions of the range of transcription and will abruzzi we can demonstrate to you it really is transcribing through that entire region ok so that's the general phenomenon that we're talking about so let's make this a little bit more rigorous for a bioinformatics audience so what I'm going to do is to is to lead you through some of the sort of more systematic and global analyses of this data set and to do so we have to just agree on a couple of simple definition when I say transcription unit I'm referring to this contiguous span of transcription that we can detect by Bercy so it's not a hypothetical we know that we see transcription going from here to here and we call that a transcription unit there strand-specific so in fact this particular one we can actually document the existence of transcription on either strand and when i say c and v regions we're talking about this cluster of overlapping or closely adjacent cnvs and this bothers our reviewer this is this was somewhat arbitrary but I can yeah I can tell you it doesn't really matter what we choose that and this might seem like a very large number that CN bees that were closer than 700 that's a long way but remember the regions were querying our mega bases in size so this is this is not really a problem so that's what CNB reagent and transcription units are so here's a simulation analysis which is spotted in a somewhat busy sort of a way so I'm gonna lead you carefully through this slide to think with me about what you can see in this data set so first of all we're going to take our C and B regions and we're going to perform a stratification by the number of C and B's that they contain and the reason we're going to do this is because we're interested in determining whether singleton seeing these versus clusters of seeing these might reflect different kinds of properties at the genome so that's the first thing we're gonna do then we're gonna simply point out that you can count the number of such regions that we have at the top there so there are for example nine possible and I didn't mention that this cluster of greater than equal five was determined by a simulation process which allowed us to assert that five or more CNVs in our data set with the number of CNB's that we had was a non random cluster so we have nine such of those clusters in our dataset on the y-axis we're going to plot all manner of different assessments that we're going to do in trying to compare seeing these in transcription units there are if you don't think I showing up in the top go to the paper you'll see more of these plots than you know what to do with I'm gonna show you just a couple of the key ones here and one of my favorite ways of thinking about this was to look at the overlap between the C and V region and the transcription unit as a function of the percentage or fraction of the C and B region that correspondent to a transcription and just briefly this is actually a more strict criteria than simple binary overlap because that could be to two elements crossing at their edges what we're really asking is that our c NB regions really occupied by transcription units and you'll see that the answer yeah he read it is the actual region average of all of the events and so it's a way of is aggregating all of them we can also plot them all individually and then the last part in the box and whisker is the 10,000 iteration random stimulation where all of these CMV regions were distributed randomly and iteratively about the genome just to see what we would expect by a so-called random chance and what we observe now with all of this is that we clearly see first of all an enrichment of transcription units in DC and they are transcribed at a disproportionately high level and that's true for all of them Singleton's as well as hotspots okay however you can judge by the slope of this that the phenomenon becomes more and more important as you move toward larger and larger transcription they are increasingly occupied by these trance by transcription and transcription units okay so I've given you the hint along the way that large genes is what's really going on here these are big genes and in fact that's part of why we can see this very high degree of occupancy because there's such a strong correspondence between these large CDs and large gene so if I simply take that same plot and now stratify it by how stratified but score as crossing with transcription units in excess of half a mega base 500 KB what you see is that the same phenomenon is existent but the degree of enrichment for the singleton is drifting toward actually the random distribution it's becoming less important whereas with the hotspots it's becoming actually and still more important than the slope is increasing which basically is telling you that the large genes are really what's driving this particular set of hotspots transcription is associated with all of them but large gene transcription is associated with the hotspot so to look at that in a little more detail we're gonna do sort of the reciprocal analysis and rather than randomizing cnv region positions we're gonna randomize the transcription units and keep the CNP region's fixed it's somewhat the same you expect to get some largely the same answer but it allows us to now look and make a plot of the degree of enrichment as a function of transcription unit like same kind of plot and what you can see is that it really is a strongly linked dependent phenomenon in terms of the correspondence transcribed regions of the genome to C and B and I might argue that this is something of an exponential increase which we'll come back to later and the other way of just thinking about this is that at that data point the twelve of transcription units and again this is actual transcribed regions of the DNA greater than one megabyte 11 out of the 12 of them yielded C and our relatively small data set so we think that's fairly fairly strict okay so based on that we said we believe we can predict the locations of where C and E's will occur based on where large genes are being transcribed so isn't that true so to do this we're going to now make new of another normal human fibroblast cell line so the data I've been telling you about have been executed principally on a cell line called bone I know it's alignment we use not that many other people use it h f1 is the fibroblast cell line that machs is used in most of his Bruce seek validation steps so we now have the opportunity to compare two cell lines so we obtained brucey analysis on own I know and now we said having not yet done the cnv analysis can we predict where we might see novel C and V formation in h f1 so let me walk you through this then a lot of busy data on this table but it's relatively easy to digest that when we look at the transcript the Trent the the transcription unit in excess of one mega base that are present in both of the cell life we see cnv and both when we look at the transcript that are only present in the o9o cell line in the long isoform we see very significantly an accumulation of CDs in oh nine only but not in hf one and this is I don't have the numbers up here but that's clearly significant by test now the other one which is what we were really hoping to get after was actually to observe transcripts there were only present in hf one but weren't expressed in onna no and there were two of these no I want to emphasize and I blew this on the next slide as well that they are expressed you know and I know just not in the long isoform alright now we didn't detect any CD's but this was with a relatively small number of HF one raised compared to what we've done with so to be able to ramp this up without breaking our bank we actually turned to a directed set of assays using snip assays so just a simple gel based RFLPs a and the left is simply validating a point that i've already made that it regions that h f1 does not transcribe it does not show c beat but the real kicker on the slide is over here where we have this gene dab 1 which you can see has short and long isoforms oh and I know expresses the short isoform h f1 clearly expresses the long isil and so we put various snip probe within here and we detected 2 C and B that correspond as do they all to the middle of the long isoform transcription and we only detected them in hf1 and not know the p-value is maybe less inspiring and might have liked but the way we like the state this result is that we went into a place in the genome that we have never seen a CMV before and based on the transcriptional profile said we would see seeing you there and we did and so we actually think that p-values on the side this is actually it was a fairly robust demonstration okay so what about fragile sites sure all of these are measured in these cells growing in tissue culture and they are obtained from the exact cells growing in tissue culture so I have a flask of one cell type of plastic of another and I harvested RNA and measurement okay there fiber bus so it's a primary turd immortalized fibroblast actually other than ES cells which I briefly alluded to that's what all of the cells in these studies are all right so fragile sites was one of our other connections we were trying to make here what we've observed if I were to just repeat briefly what we saw on the last slide is that because we see a transcriptional dependence of this type we actually imagine that there could be a very strong cell type specificity to these phenomena and in fact that now becomes a simple way of explaining all of our conundrums previously and in fact it explains the common fragile site could undo them as well so what we realize is that we had to measure fragile sites in the fibroblasts that we were studying in order to make proper comparisons and when we do so I won't lead you through this complicated table but the data are there that we see a very good degree of correspondence you can get a visual impression of this by simply comparing the cnvs and the fragile sites on the top and the bottom and you can just quickly realize that there's a very strong degree of correspondence between them and then when I settled on this three key 1 3 hotspot this was one of those times when the literature helped us we already knew when we read the paper from the day batise group in France that they demonstrated that indeed not in lymphoblasts but in fibroblasts certain fibroblast cell lines will express a fragile site at the 3 key 1 3 locus so indeed these do correspond our prior exception really was not an exception here's another way of looking at the fragile psyche part of the story and that is to ask so we had the very interesting region on chromosome 7 now where we had two genes very close to each other which showed in one case a common long eisah form transcription and in the case of this gene we keep coming back to oddest to a difference in the pattern so oh and I know in this case expressed the long isoform and hf1 expressed it's a little unimpressive in this in way the slide ends up having to appear because we end up having to expand the scales so far this is very clear and unquestionable transcription of would be well described short ISIF form of this gene in h f1 and down here we do just showing this one quick panel to demonstrate fish analysis which allows us to ask pointedly whether fragile site breaks were occurring at this gene or that gene and the bottom line is that in h f1 which did not express the long isoform we did not see chromosome breaks so this once again is just another example of just trying to make sure we're right about this that we do see a nice predictive ability based on the length of the transcription and so this is my slide that you will never forget that length when it comes to transcription units rank matters okay if it's all about how long they are and I'm briefly mentioned now and on the next slide that it kind of bothers people that in fact intensity of transcription is really not a predictor of where these things occur it's actually the length of the transcription that matters so why is that what's what's going on here and now we need to get to the back to the replication Parker remember this is worlds colliding so what does this have to do with replication so let me tell you this part of the story which centers on this technique called repla C which is very much analogous to Brucie in that this is brdu labeling to execute nascent DNA sequencing no one really called it that but that's what it is and so what we're going to then do and as described by Hanson at also this is to take the cells that we've labeled in this way and then fraction ate them so that we can now make plot through stages of s and g2 of where nascent DNA synthesis ie replication was occurring as a function of relative time in the cell cycle and this is not my slide and in fact the data that we're going to be using here is not our data we actually are using and consuming the encode data here we did not actually repeat repla seek studies in our fibroblasts yet and there actually turns out to be that this really wasn't necessary and agreed with it one reason is that replication timing data is much more stable comparing cell lines of a type than is transcription so that's point number one and point number two is some of the critical observations I'm going to make on the next slides I don't need the C and B component at all and I can actually compare nascent RNA and DNA sequencing from the self-same cell types without any difficulty by consuming the encode data so let's show you what I mean so some of this is things that we certainly know prior to our study but we add a couple of things to this one is that we're actually using our brew seek actual spans of transcription what I would argue is a better way of actually measuring transcription than other inferences that can get made and the other thing is that we can obviously add our C and D data to so what we see in the top left is sort of by definition a balanced distribution of replication timing when we consider the whole genome through these different stages because that's how the study is executed but if we stratify it by the transcribed in green and the untranscribed in that red color portions of the genome you can see a very obvious bias that the transcribed genome replicates early the untranscribed we didn't describe this phenomenon but what we can now demonstrate is that when we take the same genome in the same data and stratify it by the number of seen B's we see in this region that these low-intensity wants for example the singleton cnvs and the red color skewed just a little bit toward early replication which makes sense because they're transcribed however these hotspots CNB's even though they're transcribed do something very unusual they still they stay or they exist very late replication profile okay there transcribed but they replicate late and that's unusual on a genome-wide basis alright so why is this it's because they're long now if you're prone to seizures the next part of the slide might be a time to turn away so this is an analysis where what we're plotting is replication of both replication timing on the x axis and transcription intensity on the y axis and as the animation proceeds you're moving to larger and larger transcription so you're seeing what happens to transcription and replication timing as we as genes get longer and what's very obvious is that as genes get longer they transcribed later and later this is two different cell types using perfectly paired replication and transcription data so we have no difficulty with self self you know type comparison problem what I also want you to notice in addition to the obvious later replication timing is that the transcriptional intensity while it's a fairly subtle effect on the slide this is actually a log based access this this state designation is log based and it's slowly drifting downwards and so it's just something in the range of about a fivefold drop in an average transcriptional intensity so long genes are not very highly transcribed this may not surprise you but it actually accounts for this fact when I tell you that our CMV intensities don't correlate with transcriptional intensity it's because long genes aren't really fact that highly transcribed on the grand scheme so how do we explain all of that so here's actually a couple of my favorite plot but there's some of the more difficult to understand so let's just quickly try to see if we can't make sense of it so first pay attention to the blue and the red traces here where were you looking at replication timing on the y axis as a function of transcription unit size and again we are talking about measured transcription and what you can see is that the I'm sorry I need to explain this the then we're gonna plot data from three points in genes the ends of the genes and the middle and so it can now just look at the ends of the gene and what I want you to see is that the end the genes transcribed later and later as such as gene size gets bigger and this is important because we're trying to understand why it is that large genes replicate lay one of the reasons is that their actual transcript their actual replication timing starts later at the end is there still a beneficial effect of being transcribed toward earlier replication indeed there is and this is a little bit subtle but if you just look here this is comparing large genes between two cell lines that of which only one of them expresses the gene and what I want you to just quickly notice is that there's no overlap and the reason for that is that I am r9t this particular fibroblast line that expresses the genes labeled in red has pulled them towards slightly earlier replication and the same thing is happening in reciprocal on the other side what that basically is telling you that even the large genes do have this pulling toward earlier replication timing as a result of being transcribed but it's just much much less obvious than it is with small genes small genes get pulled all the way up to the earliest replication okay so that's what's happening at the end of the gene but then another thing I need you to notice is that the middle of the genes as gene size increases the Middle's of the genes become disproportionately later relative to their ends and this is sort of not obvious maybe the first time you think about it but it's all depicted right here if we simply make the assumption that all of the origins that are replicating these regions flank the genes then the spot in the middle of the gene necessarily becomes farther and farther away from its origin as gene length increases that's a perfectly simple way of explaining that observation it also can be seen in this slide so I do something fairly standard analysis we take all these transcription units line them up and look at their disposition of the relative replication timing and we see this obvious u-shape to the relative replication timing which again is that result of the fact that transfers that replication is proceeding inward from the ends all right now the punchline of this is we're always going to keep trying to connect this back to C and V and this is what we see when we do that same type of a alignment plot with the CNB's when we look at the position of deletion copy number variants they correspond precisely to the center point of that latest replication timing what would actually be then the termination zone of replication at the centers of the large gene duplication CNVs don't do that in fact they have this tendency to show a reciprocal sort of alignment where they actually are accumulating on the planks of these large transcription units okay a picture's worth a thousand words so that's a lot of graphs and a lot of stuff let's just tie all this together and and help you understand what we're talking about all right so replication is proceeding inward from to end towards some central region of the genome and because what we do to these cells is stress them with replication stressors we see blocks in replication progression that's the hypothesis at untranscribed regions of the genome it's welded understood that we can get the firing of late or sometimes called dormant origin which will rescue the replication of this region our hypothesis is that large transcription units change this reality from the genome and that what's going to happen now is that when these same replication failures occur that transcription of this very large gene has necessarily proceeded into S phase and the core hypothesis is that they then evict the pre-replication complexes which may have been bound they're preventing any possibility pre firing of these late origins within these large transcription units and enforcing that reality that replication has to percieve inward through these mega base scale replicas of the genome as a result if this happens and there's fork failures on both sides we have to jump one way or another and if we jump over this unreplicated gap we get a deletion and so they accumulate in the middle of the whereas if we dump backwards andrey replicate the region we actually jump away from the ends of the gene and that's exactly what i showed you we see in the day [Music] we're getting we're getting at the end here so I'm going to skip that little bit of math just two more quick slides to demonstrate for human disease biology I've mentioned Rs 2 this is a much longer list of these long genes which are clearly associated with human syndromic and and often times neurological disorders and lastly in terms of the cancer genome what what do we see in the cancer genome so we're being on a collaboration with Lamine Baruch Eamon the Broad Institute we've been feeding us his CMV analyses of the TCGA data and here's a couple of plots showing you cancer data and our cell line data to show you the clear correspondence of hotspots of C and V formation or copy number alteration formation in cancer and ourselves and you can see that a different site the coloring here is reflecting two different cancers uterine and colon and just at a glance you can now tell that this is a cell type or a cancer type specific phenomenon that not all cancers show the same large gene clustering and a hypothesis then is that this is predicted by description because of the story I've been telling you it also means that we predict that these cells are in the replication stress which is actually a described aspect of cancer cells and then the last thing I'm just going to quickly show you here is that cdkn2a over here is also a deletion hotspot it's though but this is one this is the p19 timorous opportunity so you would actually exhume that this is the reason for this deletion hotspot is actually functional selection and that gets to this last issue because really the underlying importance of this for genomics which is that we have to come to a better grips of understanding when hyper mutagenicity is a function of selection for mutations and their functional properties versus when it is simply a passenger effect reflecting the fact that certain regions are hyper mutable alright so the conclusions are stated here the replication stress induces these they don't require any writing they correspond to large transcribed genes and fragile sites and that we can basic make a predictive model on this that clearly works in vivo and that we're studying in these other scenarios here are the people who did the work and I'd mentioned most of them and at the end of my time so I'll stop there open this up for questions yep so if you go back and I could go back there my slide of replication template switching my first one clearly invokes the concept of looping exactly that I I think that when we talk about this to this you know Megabass IC and V the jump almost certainly was much closer in physical proximity and and clearly there's data that is continuing data to elaborate the idea yeah that replication domains represent what's that what's the letters that people are using to refer to these these yeah the pads the tags thank you yes topologically is that they're that they're actually our correspondent to each other so in indeed there's there's every reason to think that these that these even though we think of them as coming in from long distances they're part of something that's said here in the nucleus can we get more precise than that it's not clear to me but but I certainly yeah I would be interesting to go through the data I haven't done this but we interesting to go through and see whether that holds true for the longest gene so so I got a quick question and maybe you covered this I missed it did you so so looking at the different cell lines and seeing the different long four short isoforms you know it's pretty pretty convincing evidence did you actually try to induce perhaps the longer eisah form in a particular cell line and then see after a treet minute that is so yes very acutely ask the question that what we have not done is within a given everything is correlated between cell yeah what we want to do and others want to do and we're cold arguing it is to actually go the other way which is to silence the long isoform by probably easier to take out oh yeah because it's we know we actually know pretty well where this neck start it's not like this is this is not an ambiguous phenomena it really has a decline start site from the defining promoter and we just need to use modern genome engineering technologies and knock it out and one of the we've talked a lot about how we could go about doing this and we have actually the ability throughout deletions to actually know the complete snip haplotype of these regions you know so I don't actually even need to do this on both alleles we can just take out order and it's actually really powerful than what we predict if you'd only CC information on one remain transcribed yeah we need to get that done well thank you for excellent calm
