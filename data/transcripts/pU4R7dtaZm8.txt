oh can people hear me hi gee yeah we can hear you good okay okay i think it's already two past hour so let's get started so hello everyone welcome to dcmp seminar series today we are pleased to welcome dr xiao tinjang a very special guest from our own medical school uh dr xiao tinjang received his phd from baylor college of medicine with his phd thesis focus on the role of dna methylation synergy in leukemia development he was previously the lando special postdoc fellow working on the 3d genome in leukemia is now a research research fact track faculty in pathology department dr john's research focused on the epigenetic regulation of key pathogenic genes in leukemia particularly on the high order complex structure in disease it has a number of high profile publication on nature genetic molecular cell and blood so with that i ask you to give your full attention to dr zhang and help me welcome him to the virtual stage dr jung you are up okay thank you so uh so it's a great honor to be here and then to get invited by you know my friend jie and also we're actually doing collaboration now but uh but anyway so i'll just get started and uh can everyone see my slides yeah so it looks good okay thank you so okay so uh so thank you forgive all the invitation in the first light and then i will just try to talk about our recent work uh on the 3d organization of human genome in the normal and the malignant hematopoiesis but by saying this hematopoiesis i mean i'm really i'm actually meaning that is the production of the blood so uh okay so then i will just uh start from a broader a broader view of the non-coding genome so as we know from the finish of the uh human draft genome we know that most of our genome is actually non-coding and then these non-coding elements actually in the decades of research has been proved to be very functional in regulating the important gene expression and is having a lot of genetic virus and associated and associated with the disease so um so in that case you know to study this non-choline genome and and we know that a lot of the time these non-coding genomes lies pretty far away uh from the protein coding genes and you know if with the traditional reverse or forward genetics method i will take very a very long time to actually discover these elements and luckily actually in the decades of epigenomic research we know now and these non-coding these like long-range laboratory elements or the non-coding uh non-coding genome elements actually can be fined by the labeling of the uh by certain marks in the in the ip genetic marks uh like histone marks and also some electron insulators while looking for the cdcf sites so that's why uh nih actually initiated encore projects and to look for the uh transcription as well as all this uh um all these uh ip genomic genomic modifications uh in the human tissues and cells so today i'm mostly going to talk about uh is the three-dimensional chromatin structure as well as the histone multiplication and dna methylation and the correlation between them so and here is all the all the type of the sequence next generation sequencing technologies and and it's highlighted by encode i think in this audience probably i don't need much time uh you know to introduce this so uh and so firstly i'll start to uh and i'll start on the method on how to start these really genomic structures of chromatin structures but we know that actually in the linear genome and then and if we want to know us uh the distribution of certain ib genomic genomic mark so we simply align uh the signaling data and then just it's uh somehow like a b's on the screen model and we know where it's distributed however for these 3d genome essentially has been folded and into the very small nucleus so what is the principle for such a fossage folding and people have developed a master and pioneer by you dagger about two decades ago called chromatin conformation capture so this uh the idea about this semester is basically assume that a two locus which actually um a distance from each other in the linear genome will actually come together in this uh in this three-dimensional chromatin structure and then maybe hold by certain protein the way we do it is actually we take the cells and fix the cells to preserve such organization and after we preserve this organization we perform the restriction enzyme digestion and then to leave the uh close by locus in the 3d genome together and then we perform the approximately proximity ligation and then in that case the uh the locus close up in the 3d space uh will form these chimeric molecules then we will be identified in the next generation sequencing so um and to visualize such interactions and about and about implementations i've been using something that's called correlation matrix and to and to show the relationship between the uh the uh between the four interactions between different locus you can imagine if there's only the linear dna and so uh when we perform this kind of like a adapter ligation so mo sorry there's a proximity ligation so most of the uh locals will associate with themselves and sometimes by chance you will have some interactions and with this neighboring regions and however if you perform this kind of like a approximately ligated chromatin um chromatin structure and then you will find like like the locus like amd will have significantly higher frequency to interact in compare with the random interaction by chance so this is how we actually um uh and this doesn't matter how we're going to use and to study and to visualize the um the interaction between the locus and the genome y and in the real in the real data sets however we don't have we don't do this kind of like restriction fragments so there's no such perfect illusion fragments can do and can be aligned perfectly so the bioinformatics about my researchers has been doing is actually they take the genome and then they chop the genome into very small beings so containing several locusts but in that case and then they also use this correlation matrix to visualize such a correlation between the different locus of the genome and so as you can expect so most of the interaction comes from the interaction between the locus and this nearby locus in this case it was generating this kind of like a diagonal signal mainly however sometimes uh for example unlike the genes from like the locus from c to f you actually form this correlation between each other and then this kind of car uh closely correlated region is called uh a compartment in the uh unit in this 3d chromatin structure so this kind of compartments and then when we when uh when researchers are looking at this kind of components in the genome whole genome level what they find out is actually but the genomic cycle organized into this mutually exclusive compartments but it means actually follow the region from a to i they may forms like in two compartments which actually uh separate uh separate from each other and then from here we can have two compartments and containing the locus a to b and i to i and then in in the middle is something we call insulators so this particular insulator is separate within the two compartments so then depending on how how you bend the genome so if you bring the genome in really large scale then you can get something called a b compartments so a compartment is something is active and then it's in reach and it's re is a g reach region but the b compartment is silent and g input region and and if you further do me you can get this topological social domain which spans from point one to one minor base but still you can see and they are actually mutually exclusive and sometimes you will see essentially this kind of insulator this insulator of elements will form a very strong interactions on top of the topological social domain in greece and then this particular this particular interaction is something called chromosome books so uh and so this is a this is basically you know the types of interactions in our genome and people has been widely uh started it's actually topological sort of domains and also the chromosome loops showing here so all all i have been showing you is all based on the sequencing and chromatin confirmation they uh capture data and what is the uh what is about our physical force about chemical form of media uh to mediate such formation of the domains and loops so it turned out to be uh people find out this uh we need a two complex molecular complex here to form this topological social domain which is actually cohesion complex and then ctcf sites so what it does is actually we know that cohesion is a molecular motor so and here comes a cohesion and cohesion will actually extrude the chromatin fibers and uh and what and what ccf do is actually will stop uh it will stop the cohesion extrusion process and then uh and interestingly and to ccf sites have to be in a certain orientation and so and it's how to begin this kind of convergence back to head orientation and then this extruded part and here is actually the top logical social domain and then and then uh and then the city cf which stopped the cohesion intrusion lies on the border of tax and also and also the loops is called the title loop anchors and which actually is ctcf binding sites so this is basically uh people's idea now of how uh you know these tags and loops uh forms so um we know okay so these type of loops forms and what and what the what what what's this function uh in regulating the gene expression so we fi and so and so there's multiple um literatures about this and then what people have been find out is actually uh these tags actually enhance and the interact language interaction between an enhancer and a gene inside of the test so some people is also arguing that actually the test is preventing the enhancers and to assess another gene and other tests there is several literature recently argued against this model resulting heartly and debated um and so uh so um what i'm going to talk about today is actually about the generation of the blood cells in in our body every day so basically uh you know we're really interested essentially the normal hematopoiesis uh process is called and you can see in this what's a hematophiesis mean is the production of blood so as you can see here in this chart of the normal hematopoiesis is actually on the top here is the stem cells it's going to always maintain itself and then gave rise to the precursor and progenitors it will later turns into all these mature blood cells let's say you know the red blood cell carries oxygen and then platelets stop the bleeding and also you know all the granulocyte and monocyte five-fold bacterias and also the lymphocytes that generate antibodies and so um as you can see here and this is actually uh the process in our body is happening every day and you can see here this normal process is coupled and and from the stem cell to the mature cell is called differentiation as you can see from the differentiation process so the nucleus of the cells actually undergoes a huge alteration in the morphology so and in our in in the as so i was trained as a hematologist so we're always wondering okay so in this process so what exactly has uh what exactly has been changed uh and during this process to promote this kind of like the proper differentiation so uh bearing that in mind so which what we choose the model we choose is actually regular cell differentiation so uh in the high school biology we know that you know the mammal the mammal red blood cell is without a nucleus and then and during this differentiation and first you know the red blood cell precursor progenitors they still have a nucleus but during this process you know nucleus become very small and then condensate and then uh non-condensate and so there and so it's it it's actually really interesting to see so what during this content nuclear condensation process so what's the um pattern loop level is changed so based on this idea so then we isolate the chemotherapy stem cells and also the regular cell precursors and and and then perform this uh high resolution in cyto high semester try to dissect you know the uh 3d chromatin architecture change during this red blood cell differentiation process um okay so and here i'll show you some of the data i mean a very uh that's very very very raw data and so as you can see it's actually showing here up in upper triangular is the stem cell high c contact map and then the lower triangle here is the red blood cell precursor uh high c contact map so you know globally what we find out is actually the task level doesn't change that much as you can see in this plot is also the same thing so uh the task precision also doesn't change much as well and also we all we find a very interesting part is actually in the regular cell precursors the loops uh the root number has been decreased significantly as you can also see in this plot is here is uh the the one arrow pointing is the two chromosome loops however after differentiation these loops is uh disappears and uh but uh but we do have some difficulty you know incorrelating of this kind of like loop disappearance with the gene expression and also this is the same thing happens on the task and then so um you know make us you know a little bit disappointing as at the first time all right when we first looked at the data and and also uh the something we discovered all people has discovered before however i mean uh the tether loops are not the only uh structures you can find in this high c heat map and then so today i'm going to talk about the uh two things so first thing is actually we have discovered that actually um one kind of one kind of epigenetic elements called d-e-musculation k-ns they actually are interacting with each other uh form a very distinct 3d genome interactions in the hematopoietic stem cells and also if our time i'll talk about briefly about our collaboration program was here on the uh iml 3d genomics so okay so our first uh i'll just uh started from the our part one on the discovery about the demonstration k interactions in stem cells so um as we i mean if some of you work on dna methylation you probably know the dna methylation is the modifications occurs on the cpg size which actually is this primary role i believe to be repressed the transcription and so most of our genome has been musculated so every cpg average cpg size in our genome it's almost a muscular a hundred percent so this in this whole you know by software track and then these sites are all like very heavily methylated to 90 or 80 percentage so here is the dip so this kind of dip in the whole genome biosulfide sequencing it's actually the cpg islands and which is the cluster of cpg sites it's not getting musculated and then if and and this is a this is a part of the part of the genome and if you actually scroll around and into to look for the uh to look for the different uh different regions you will see actually sometimes you will encounter this really wide region actually is the way of any dna methylation so this type of this type of the uh this type of the uh dip in the whole genome bisulfide sequencing is what we call demonstration kenyans and then uh here's a lot of example of the biggest demonstration kenyans in the most immature politics stem cells as you can see and this actually spans around 60 sorry 40k kilobase pair and then base and we defined the imagination canyon as the unmusculated region so span over 3.5 kb and then that's actually reached and we find out is it's important and it's also enriched for the developmental homo box genes so um okay so and then just by serendipity then we actually um we will load the demonstration canyon onto the high c map what we find out is actually now this dn maximization canyons are actually uh from this very long-range interactions alzheimer's like topological social domains as you can see in this example is actually the mutual interactions between drx1 locus sp9 locus and also huxley locus as you can see they they each fall and they and this form is mutual interactions so suggesting all these three cl all these three locus actually clustered together and you can also see that this is the interactions between these three methylation canyons are actually stem cell specific and offer a differentiation into the y blocks of precursors these interactions has been gone and if you take a look at um if you take a look at the fish data and then to further validate this you can also see that um you know in the stem cell the two locus are clustered together and in the regular cell however it's just it's getting separated so um so when we find this you know we thought okay this is something very exciting because this is something people uh haven't been described before rather and because because our uh uh you know our uh emphasis has been mostly on the tags and boost during this differentiation process however um we at that time we already know is actually the dmacc nation canyon is not fully um it's actually not um it's a it's a mixture or let's in other words like a hydro genius in the chromatin state so it means it's actually it's a mixture of active enhancer promoter and also the polycom binding sites as you can see here it's active in promoter and then here is the polycom binding types because these are the two chromatin modification history marks for antagonizing the dna musculation in our genome so then the the here pops up the question so what specific dna maximization k changes are interacting so you know you may guess this actually is the active part you know because the active enhancer promoter may form this kind of like you know very strong interactions promoting the gene expressions so we decided to use a method called the aggregation peak analysis to look for such interactions so how this uh method works is basically take your regional interest and then it's flanking regions and then i'll tile up this interactions in this 2d contact matrix if you have the uh the your region of interest is actually interacting then you can see this type of and then you will have a peak uh and also in this kind of heat map and you and uh and it's over and you can see there's significantly a signal increase over the background so if it's not interacting you know the center will be roughly the same as the background so this is how we actually uh tease out such significant interactions between your region of interest so here's one example of the chromosome loops so as you can see here for the chromosome loops uh i mean the number here is just indicating how far away the two loop bunkers are getting separated but first you can see that in the if the two loops the bunkers are separated by around 200 kilo base pairs so there's a significant interactions between the two loop anchors as you can see it's come that the signal comes from in the center and then is significantly higher over the background and also you can see here is that so the uh the sizable loop means you know the distance between the two loop bunkers so seldom exceed two megabase so because you know the genome in our genome we have many cdcf and cohesion binding sites so making this kind of loop size uh you know smaller than two megabytes and then when we first perform this interact analysis on dna methylation kenyans so what we find out is actually most of the dna methylation kenya's are not interaction so this represents 80 of all the methylation kenyans so separate is uh categorized by the lens of the canyons and that's and how interesting is actually we find out it's only longest 20 of kns is actually having the uh uh having the lungs over 7.3 kb uh interacting with each other so this just indicating that okay so and also you can see that it's actually no matter how distance the two kenyan locus are separated from each other you can always see such strong interactions and and in one extreme case we even find that the two dimension canyons are interacting um and interacting each with each other and then these two locals are actually separated by around 130 megabytes so this is almost the entire uh lung arm of the chromosome of human chromosome 2. so this this this is suggests that okay so the dna and the dna masturbation canyons interaction is distinct from you know chromosome loop interactions and also as i said uh previously so the loop interactions have a feature about the ctcf orientation where it's formless convergent interactions so as you can see here for the loop hunkers so they will have a lot of this hard to add convergence gcf interaction however for the long long time interactions actually does not favor any types of the cdcf orientations further suggests that actually these long-term interactions are independent of the cohesion loop uh cohesion multiplicity model we have other data to show that upon the degradation of cohesion and there is no change in the k interaction as well so further it is showing that uh the long kind interactions and cohesion interactions are very two independent uh two independent uh 3d genomics features in the in the human genome so um so then then what will make this longest 20 kenyan special so and i showed you before essentially uh these canyons are actually enriched for k27 trimethylation and also for the active uh caveman style simulation but then we take a look at whether these long canyons are in reach for the k-27 trim oscillations all the k-27 accelerations so what we find out is that these regions are actually in the genome are the strongest regions for the k27 trimestylation enrichment and while at the same time it does not have any overlap with the enhancer emphasis with the active marks so i mean then i think you know this make us uh very very confident to name this special long canyons uh grand canyons so okay so um then because uh the k-27 trimethylation levels in these uh grand canyons are so high so then let's come to a question so whether these are the forces driving a deformation of these grand canyon interactions so we know that this k-27 trim oscillation is deposited by something called polychrome repressive complex two and to be specific this k-27 trimestylation is methylated by easyh2 and then now we have a very good easy2 inhibitors in clinical trial then so our idea is actually we treat the cells with eg2 inhibitors and then see whether that will change the 3d genome uh these 3d interactions of these grand canyon interactions so as you can see here if we treat with each issue inhibitors it's very effectively eradicate the k27 triangulation globally and then in grand canyon regions as well and uh and and when we perform the uh when we perform the uh aggregation peak analysis we find is actually the treatment of these two inhibitors has reduced the uh grand canyon interactions from 73 to 22 and then at the same time the loop level is not affected so suggesting that the uh decay high calculation trim methylation level in grand canyons are indeed required for such interactions um so uh here is uh uh here is uh our mod our model so we think is actually so the dn methylation uh the unmusculated uh uh so the uh the unisonated region just serve as a reservoir to actually uh allow the k27 trimestylation nucleosomes and and to and to be deposit so in a certain stage i mean if it hits a certain level let's just say grand canyon level and then you have enough k27 trimestylation nucleosomes it will probably segregate by themselves or recruit a poly prc1 protein called human b and they may form these punctures and apparently is your true treatment so you lost the k-27 trimestylation so they may uh they may lose this self-segregated property or they may lose you know the um uh recruitment of the ring one b and then they would and you can see here after treatment the human being you know all goes out of the nucleus so suggesting that uh i mean showing that is made it also lost maybe lost the recruitment human being to form this kind of clusters in the 3d genomes so um so without without that i'll just summarize my first part so we have been shown that actually the musculation kenyans only the longest 20 percent of kenyans are interacting and these are exclusively polycom targets with the highest k27 translation level and it's also cohesion ccf dependent uh independent and then uh we publish this thing on molecular cell uh in may uh in may and we as a cover article and as we depict the grand canyons as the uh glacier here holding a lot of interlinked pigmented salmon trim oscillation nucleus so here okay so uh here's my first part so uh i mean i would like to stop here and then just to see whether you guys have any questions okay so any questions no can people hear me it was very good uh you know i uh you know one thing i thought i don't know if this is a question or observation the canyons i think indicate a place where you might have not so many uh transcription factor proteins that bind into the chromatin and so you know it's uh so probably allowing the chromatin to close down to a heterochromatin state and be more more more repressed so you know it's just um i i think it's really good i mean the talk so far is great i mean you know we're learning from you it's really good and it does lend itself to the idea that likely we're going to be able to machine learn against the uh you know the chromatin capture you know data especially if we have uh you know collections of that data to look for these subtleties and these different lengths of loops and some of the transitions that would occur in that space it's more thinking more of it as a phase diagram than something uh you know the way we do in physical chemistry so you know i just think it's really good what you're doing is great so far so i don't want to like monopolize it but we are alive and paying attention oh okay okay thank you thank you yeah all right okay yeah okay okay okay then uh yeah i think that i definitely agree with you so you know we probably just you know this subtle interactions sometimes will vary you know in the tabs and the loops and then this is also something you know when jia helped me to analyze the data and this is something can be better you know another thing is just in terms of the timing of these different things i mean you know how when you know the sequence and how fast certain uh transitions are like the extrusion of the loops and you know that kind of thing i mean there's a whole there's a time series evolution here that i think you know we lose sometimes when we look at an averaging over you know the uh you know because the chromatid capture that one of the problems of course is that the chromatid capture itself is an average of a lot of different chromosome chromatin states uh you know there are different chromatin states and different nuclei and they're it's not a single cell technique averaging population technique so we have to you know so they're so we have to be aware of that too so there's uh that limits uh you know somewhat what we can do but you know with gia on one side of you and josh on the other you're probably gonna be able to figure that out too okay yeah yeah that's very good okay thank you okay so i'll just uh you know keep going keep going so okay so uh i'll show you you all all this grand canyon interactions so um but so what what's the function of this thing uh in regulating gene expressions well as you know that is you know for the enhancer promoter interactions it's actually really straightforward mechanism where you have enhancer and then promotes the gene expression in this case is the grs enhancer controlling the epson hydraulic logos locus so what will happen is actually if you have if you don't have the rtrs locus then the sonic hedgehog will not express and after it's not expressed you know the mouse will not have a lag um so you know it would turns into this snake-like mouse according to this altering of the papers so for the grand canyon interaction it's a little bit different right so because we are talking about the repressive to repressive kind of interactions and interesting thing is um most of the grand canyons are actually enriched for the developmental uh important homeobox genes but if we use crispr carcinoid to remove some of these kenyans you also you always impact the gene so then it makes you know such entire interrogation of the non-coding sequence you know very difficult so then what about you know if you have a canyon with all the gene in there so then you can easily dissect this canyon by using crispr cosmetic technology some of that so uh actually we are very lucky is actually we do uh it's also by serendipity we actually find a locus like that so we name this thing called genius canyon because it does not have a gene in there so this particular canyon is actually forming uh interactions with the important developmental and stem cell gene the hoxie cluster genes as you can see here uh the canyons are forming this kind of like interactions and and and also they're both in reach for high k 27 trim oscillations and you can also see that this kind of interactions uh it disappears after differentiation suggesting it's a stem cell specific interaction and also interesting thing is actually in um between the posterior hawks say and also the genus canyon is the active as the um is there three classical tasks domain and then also three chromosome loops that connecting the active hawks a with these upstream enhancers so then you can actually uh thinking is that uh so this is a tone to show this thing where the um repressive canyons are interacting with each other on on outside while the uh enhancer promoter interaction and chromosome moves are nested inside and uh and and within here is that with active hawks agents are both the important transcriptional factors for the stem cell genes and also the repressive one and also important developmental regulators so then uh because the genus kenya has no gene in there so makes this gene editing very straightforward so then we just design two guides and then to directly call you know this region and then um and then after that then we'll just assess um you know how much a stem cell and how much stem cell activity is there and uh how much differentiation is there so here we're using a to flow cytometry to census so we're using cities 30 ce38 as a differentiation marker and the cd34 as a self-renewal marker so means it's small stem cell like so as you can see here uh in in the control guide you create a group so there is a 40 percentage of cells is still maintained as stem cell stem cell a marker and however if we delete the genus kenya there's only 15 percentage so and also for differentiated cells and after the deletion so and now we have two forward increase and in the differentiations differentiate the cells and also when we test the stem cell activity by colony forming essay of the genus k and deleted cells and also the control uh control cells you can see that the uh colony forming activities in these genus k and deleted cells has also been greatly reduced then what about the g the g expression but as uh as i said before the hog the active oxygens are all the important uh stem cell uh these stem cell genes and then the repressive the refractive hox engines are actually expressing very low level and then when we you may think it's actually because this is actually repressor so after you remove repressor you make the factories replace the gene for them to highly express however uh when we take a little bit to the qrt pcr uh we find out is actually this repressed the hawk c11 and hawks has 13 engines has not changed in our x-ray expression that much so what what has been really impacted is actually these active uh hox genes which actually driving these uh stem cells suffering new so that actually just means so the genius kenya is actually not a repressor to repress these genes but also it maintains the active hawk say expression so um then we also perform the 3d 3d genomic analysis after the deletion of genus kenya's as you can see here previously we have really good uh you know interactions between genus kenya and also the posterior hox agents after a deletion this uh this interaction has been uh apparently lost and the other then we also take a look at these enhancer promoters between the active hawks a region and then we find out is actually for these enhancement promoter groups and then after deletion of the generous canyon this interaction has also been significantly reduced so um so in that case and in that case we propose a model is actually the repressive interactions between the genus canyon and the hawk city regions are actually forming as a stable scaffold to allow the proper enhancer promoter interactions so when you lock such interactions the answer promoters are not be not be able to form these interactions uh and very well so in that case the active hox aging expression will be impacted so um this is actually very similar you know to the uh to people thinking in the test model where the the structure is actually the test structure is allowing uh the proper uh interactions between this enhancer and promoters to enforcing these interactions so we're thinking maybe you know in this scenario in this hawk sale locus uh this genius kenya and hawk say also forming this type of structure to maintain the active gene uh transcription so okay so uh i think this is my second part and then i think we still have a little bit time so now i'll just uh switch gear a little bit trying to talk about the um the 3d genomics or iq myelo leukemia so as i showed you before so this is the normal hematopoiesis where you know it's characterized by the it's actually also characterized by the hydrogen energy because you know in a normal cell in a normal condition our body is trying to produce all kinds of you know diverse cells to maintain our body uh or in the leukemia case and this is something called leukemia blast or leukemia cells you can see these leukemia cells just looks like each other and then they are actually um a very resemble the early the early undifferentiated cells so this is the feature of our leukemia because the uncom control proliferation and it was also the differentiation block and then um and then and then these kind of uncontrolled proliferation and differentiation differentiation block and can be promoted by the old expression of these hawks clustered genes and many other genes that actually can promote such transformation so one interesting very interesting thing about the iq myeloma leukemia is actually um the icu mylar leukemias are highly rich for the dna musculation associated mutations so you can see therefore mutations in dmt3a which is actually the enzyme directly add the muscle group onto the dna and then tattoo and idh12 when they are mutated they will they will also cause the hypermusculation you will see that um these these mutations are actually very significantly uh more frequent you know in aml in comparison with all the other cancers as you can see the other cancer does not have like very frequent mutations in these skin masturbation associated genes uh associated mutations so so why we're going why we're thinking of this de-methylation mutation is important because actually we are starting the dna methylation k so i i've been towing so far as all the functions about kenyans and also the histone modifications in the canyons are important for interactions so what about the dna methylation so whether the methylation you know a change you know in the leukemia process they also alter these 3d genomic interactions about these grand canyons now so um well and here's some introduction about ideation tag mutations so as i told you as i said a little bit so it's actually ideation tab mutation will cause a dna hyper methylation so how does the idh and tab mutation will cause that so this is the pathway actually has developed has been discovered about 10 years ago so what uh what the ideation and adh in the wild type condition do is is actually it's produced a compound called alpha ketone glutamate in tca cycle and then and then alpha ketone glutamate is an important substrate for the tad and and the the dna d-methylase and also the histone d muscularis to get rid of the uh the muscle mark from the dna um however when the idh gets mutated and then this mutation will overproduce something called the 2-hydroxy glutamate which actually looks very like alpha ketone glutamate and then we'll compete with alpha ketone glutamate and inhibit the function of types and then kdms then that in that case will cause the failure of the methylation and then causing the hypermethylation globally and also it will cause the histone of histone hypermethylation globally as well so basically speaking when the cell with ideation attached so it will cause the global dna hypermethylation will increase the hyper musculation in the in the cpg sites so i would wonder whether we can mimic the situation by treating the normal stem cells with two hydroxyl glutamate so after we treated two hydroxyl groups we find out is actually it also eradicates the grand canyon interactions now it's down to twelve percent so it's even more and then the humidity in in the uh than the easiest two treatments so suggesting that okay uh maybe the hyper methylation caused by d2 d2hg also cause the loss of interactions so um now how this thing can happen so we showed that actually before so the demasculation kenyan is modulated by dmt3a so the enzyme that's actually adding the methylation and all and after you knock out the dna muscle dmh ray so your kenya actually getting expanded and then if you knock out tattoo now you'll get hyper musculature in the canyon mono canyon has been really become very small so it may be actually this region after you know you get hyper musculation you squeeze out you know the k27 trim oscillation and then making the interaction a lot weaker so um so also and also because uh uh things are mentioned about the adhesion tag mutant so then we decide whether we want to look at uh in the primary patient sample uh carrying at each time notation whether there is some 3d genomic change so then uh we actually profile we begin to profile uh the primary iq mylar leukemia and some cell lines at the same time and then um and then and then we have this ima carver's mlv arrangement leukemia and pm1 mutated leukemia and also runs one leukemia at the year mpm mutated leukemia and we have idh mutation and time mutation here and then here is the 3d clustering of these uh these cells based on their 3d genomic profile as you can see these cell lines are all the kind of like outliers in comparison with this primary cells and we decide to look all like all ihd primary cells so um then uh then the next thing we uh next thing we do is just to compare the top logical solid domain structures in this aml when we find out is actually this uh these uh these topological sulfur domains in the in the leukemias and also in the normal stem cells are pretty much alike so you as you can see you know that first of all the test number doesn't change much and also the precision of tests doesn't change much as well and sometimes you can get this uh you know detect alteration events uh sometimes one pads in the stem cell can become two and in the leukemia and also vice versa and then we are also like investigating how that can contribute to the gene expression and the interesting thing we find and and then here come to the 3d genomic analysis on the kanyon interactions so we and then we take out the region about the uh of the grand canyons in the city 34 stem cells then uh then we just see okay whether this are still there in these leukemias what we find is actually for this kind for this leukemia is not involved in any type of the epigenetic mutations the kind of interactions are pretty much maintained the same or even stronger and then when we take a look at the um and in this again this i'm already in rhythm and leukemia it's becoming decrease uh sorry the interaction uh decrease a little bit and then in the ideation tag mutation however uh the uh the ground k interaction just further goes down so this may suggest that actually ideation tag mutations may do cause uh may cause a hyperventilation in this grand canyon region and then cause the loss of such interactions so here's the example and you can see that in ml reinventment leukemia you still have some hawksd and then drx1 interactions uh as you uh suggested here that in the um in the idh1 mutated leukemia uh uh then this interaction these interactions between the grand canyons has been clearly eradicated so there's a further just to show you guys exactly ideation tag mutations may cause the dna hypermusculation and then all that can also eradicate these three uh the 3d interactions between these grand canyons okay so um and so um we also find out it's actually um for the important genes the driving leukemia formation and and they they also have this leukemia specifically hyper acetyl-related region and these hyper acid related regions uh somehow form its own chromosome domain in comparison with the uh normal stem cells as you can see in pbx3 locus here and also the two locus where you can clearly see a new domain has been popped out in the leukemia and then importantly these are all the genes actually directly promoting leukemia development and so uh i will just skip one slide here and then here's our summary of what we find in the iq milo leukemia exactly in the normal chemotherapeutic stem cells we have very strong interactions between the particle mediated grand canyons the grandin methylation kenyans and then there is maybe some you know enhancer promoting interactions in some of the key oncological oncogenic genes however in the leukemia case now we have to loss such interactions between the polycommunicated dna musculation canyons and uh and at the same time so the enhancer and promoters has formed their own domains and then draw and driving a high expression of leukemia of the key oncogenic genes like zab2 pbx3 and hexa which actually don't have time to show you so it's solid like you know the seesaw not just like has been tilted okay so with all that you know i would like to uh acknowledge my former team and uh especially uh haiti who perform all this uh lecture and vision sequencing and library construction and also our wonderful collaborator uh dr dr julio slap and then all right and also fun and the xinjiang child who have promised analysis and also our my character live hacks and also with my funding cells and here's the qr code for you guys to assess the aml 3d genomics data okay so that that's all for for my talk today so i'll just uh stop and then uh take questions thank you yeah okay thank you so much and that's the fabulous talk so first let's see whether we have questions from the audience so if you have a question you can unmute yourself you know it's been said that cancer is a disease of the dna i think you're suggesting that maybe we it's a disease of the chromatin i mean did you want to comment on that uh yes i'm sorry i think uh yeah it's a i think in leukemia case actually um the chromatin definitely you know involved a lot uh you know in developing leukemia so like a classical case like ml rearrangement leukemia uh you know it's something definitely uh people has been used a lot to study the um you know the transformation and um i i mean i don't know why but uh i think in the solid tumors this chromatin associated mutation is not that frequent and then um and then you can only find like mlml3 in some of the in some of the cancers but it's not like uh chromatin associated mutations are not as frequent as you know the uh like tp53 or rash mutations in all this tumors so i mean it's definitely i think you might you might feel leukemia seems like a very unique uh case where you know the chromatins and it's very it's definitely a very important and also a demasculation is something like also very very important because it is the case where you know you can see um this a lot of the musculation associated mutations yes so i'd like to follow up it's gilman a very nice talk first is are you aware of the aml work under the cp tech proteogenomics program of the national cast ii uh rural chennai and alexandria and others of us are involved in those uh cancer-specific studies are you seeing that relevant to your work no i actually i'm not quite sure about this work uh you know um it's i'll be mostly on working on genomics so the proteomics is pretty uh i mean we haven't heard much about this yeah that's okay but here's the reason i'm telling you about it there's a new strategy about all this which is to bring the genomics and the proteomics people together call it proteogenomics oh that's great so i would encourage you when you have the chance yeah uh you know at least look up the papers from uh nazriski and and uh chennai okay we're in your department okay and uh some of them i'm on also it's it's very interesting about various kinds of cancers and it's we've not been so much involved about aml but other groups around the country have including brian druker in in sciences and i'm sure you know that name yes yes that's true yeah the other is about the tads yes so there's a lot of interest here on the tads in um and dica roger poxie's group do you know indica and his students like stephen linsley and scott ronquist did you know these folks no i haven't actually yes that's why we like to have these seminars to try to connect people okay you're in michigan and other places of course also but especially here and in our department so if you could take those names of indica i-n-d-i-k-a okay r-a-j-a-s-p-i-j r-a-j-a-p-a-k-s-e and stephen linsley l-i-n-d-s-l-y we're doing some really nice projects there and they're deep into tads um i think you find it very interesting there's also a whole seminar series just starting with a famous mathematician who's interested in sma and tads oh that's great and that's steven schmale that's a name worth knowing he has four degrees from university of michigan wow medalist wonderful man just celebrated his 90th birthday in july with a big symposium wow okay and we are part of the schmale research institute here in michigan okay right which has a meeting tomorrow between one and five kills so we shouldn't forget that well i thought it was at four o'clock tomorrow it's all afternoon i think it's all afternoon so check that out so so uh you know this is uh really good so have you maintained your contacts with the panhandle institute yeah i do have some contact with them right i think that should be maintained you know that's uh good and that they have some participation in the cp tech also cpa type arizona i think it's a good thing to do and you know we build up a lot of collaborations with those guys early on and then you know fellow i'm trying to remember his name you know who's the dean over there so i went to school with them so we've got a good connection so uh you know so the so my my next question i guess would be you know that the chroma didn't capture and some of the methodology that you know throughout your talk that you really um showed some nice work with you know hasn't i think been able to you know be used kind of as in in a clinical in a clinical validation setting it's a basic tool you know it's a tool for basic research but it isn't a tool for you know kind of diagnostic or this this is this is i wonder how you can like what you have to do to like move this into the uh translate it into a something that could be directly applied yeah exactly so i think this is something like you know i um uh so i for i have a slide but i think you know it's too much so i'll take it out so i think uh you know high c has been validated to be a very good tool to dissect the structural variations but this is something uh you know i also try to collaborate here with because when the uh structural variation is generated you would generate something like very distinct from this uh uh like tags and groups so um and then it's and when this thing generated is actually you can immediately catch that so that's why i think you know this is a very good truth to actually identify uh different types of structural variations and then um you know and also what uh my some of my work is actually show is that right if you actually can dance somehow these things uh just to maybe 10 million or 20 million reads and then do this high c you can see these translocations you know super easily and then maybe some of the deletions and and also some inversions as well so so i think there's definitely something uh you know from this high c uh technologies we can make this thing you know into um to starting like the new structural variations actually in my case you know we do find actually in some of the um some of the aml samples there is a very unknowable deletion that three people haven't been discovered before and that's apparently covering important tumor suppressant tumor suppressor genes so you know this is some definitely something uh you know if we want to go that route uh we still need some computation uh uh assistance so i think you know you guys probably you know it's a know this thing better than me but but apparently i think this is the direction we can go to clinical part yeah yeah okay uh it's already three minutes past hour i think we should stop here thank you for tuning in for this wonderful talk and uh thank you for attending our seminar i remind you next week we will have another 4dn talk from gemma from cmu so hope to see you again thank you uh okay thank you that was really good talk i i think it was incredible i hope you can work with us and collaborate with our department okay all these things that dr owen was saying i think there's really a lot of opportunity i know you will with the gia who you're working with already so it's really a good thing thank you so much okay thank you so much thank you
