welcome everyone happy Halloween it's great to see that a few people uh got into the Halloween spirit including our speaker so this is gon to be a very fun presentation um as a reminder we have an online audience in addition to everybody in the room so uh if you are online and you have questions please put those in the Q&A box and we will be monitoring that and can pass those along to our speaker if you're in the room and you have a question of course just raise your hand like you nor would but if you can try to speak up a little bit that would be helpful to make sure that our online audience actually hears the question in addition to the answer um I think that's actually all I have in terms of announcements I'm pleased to present uh or introduce today's speaker we have our construction worker here uh Leo sha who is a PhD student in dcmb um hi everyone and and Isa or you and just coming the today I'm presenting um our of my project recently published it's called analysis and visualization of quantive data Us in this and I currently B year PD student from yeah and I I feel like people might wonder why I dress up here probably like construction worker or like minan but I feel like that's kind of around the um Spirit of our to so this is our labs to to c p and this is me like right now presenting our l tool I feel like a general like construction scene or like pip scene but anyways like happy Halloween I hope people can enjoy the presentation and let me know if you have any question I think I'm pretty okay if you want to interrupt me any time to figure out any kind of not clear parts so just a a step back that overall goal of lab is focused on mes base analysis tool at the same time we perform many large scale proom analys project one particular example I involve is this clinical pomis tumor analysist consulant and another step back is I I figure people might not understand part A M but B foring name much you might hear transcri lot but protom is a kind of om Mi data like closer to the fenal type so it's also G much more interest and they are more than one way to do a protom but the topic I'm going to focus here will still like a mass bestest based protom I think this uh an even older technique compared to some people can do like uh single cell and cont and use antibody to to kind of profile the protein compation but in strategy I think right right now the super still like 2,000 3,000 protein in one time but M generally we can get like 10,000 in general and it's like a lower nameing you can get but the general principle is when you have a protein sample you will digest it into a pep type because it's a kind of a unit we can quantify and then go into iron source and this iron sour will put SP into like mass and we use like more than one m u analyzer um um to really get protein quantification those pepti will go to a meth analer one and further fragmented and put into like second meth analizer and then we get a detect and that's why we call the mass Metro and generally we will also coule with liquid CH graphy to do the sample separation so we can only get um small number of a protein in one window and this will be collecting the ms1 ms1 is a pepti ion and then go to MS2 this pepti will get further sequence as you can see in the low lower panel here and well oner point I feel like might be easier to see here I'm pointing yeah yeah and recent year there are many break SU in this area I think if you start probably like 20 years ago I think you will know like datab have not missing value but we have more and more either from the instrument or algorism part we we we are able to do a communication better but generally just as an introduction and background since this one of the platform and we'll talk about later in presentation in this uh TNT or tendon Mass tag is of the technique that can help us to like do the protein identification and quantification at the same time and also like since it's a technique uh like mix many sample together and you can get a conation in one so you also reduce a little bit of the battery but if you want to like run sample separately so by the general principle is you have a kind of label things so in general this kind of technique call label base compared to the earlier version probably original version we call it like a label fre and what's kind of label being add to uh into a sample is kind of like this chemical structure and then since this chemical structure is well designed when you go into ms1 MS2 they will kind of uh separate aart and you can use one of a good as a quantification uh value to to to Ty refer how much protein you have so but just it's just a general introduction of this technique the other technique I want to talk about is when you thinking about how we do a protein conation usually we talk about old conc data dependent acquisition but that means in in the ms1 we only select part part of a spectrum that with really high intensity and then go to MS2 but since the instrument breaks through and also like lots of different technique and instrument design overall I think right now another way of doing this is reallying a small window and higher Peak we can use all the window all the on one Peak they cause some problem for example you might have more than one protein contain in this isolation window but overall this technique also have a better but identification and quantification and no matter which technique you are using on computers still kind of play an important role here since you can see the complex data structure you have ms1 and every ms1 you will derise several MS2 and you need to have lots of a different algorithm by information mics tool the doal analysis so f as I introduced in the beginning we have been work on this for several year and this uh software also been used by many many people I think we can kind of company say um we take probably around like 20 or 30% of the user in this field like using our tool and generally we we have this repi ecosystem but when we reviewing our current strategy and what we are missing we realize that most of the user will find it's a bit difficult to use some of us thing because uh as a academic lab U we develop to one by one and some of them like developing by several different people so one of the key step is the quantification uh part and this actually come from like four different projects so various of outut for M on the conations that become a part that many user will get confused when they switch a platform they feel like it's not user friendly and and as I mentioned TNT is another strategy it reduce effect but generally the statistical property of the TNT data will become different from like lfq free quantification or the is still free but but generally the statistical prity are Al also different so if you are a beginner you might make some mistake in the beginning uh probably the most important part by informatics students is I find lots of the paper uh when they report something even I want to reproduce is a bit hard so generally in my mindset it's still good to have like kind of tool can address this issue and so we are missing a one um puzzle here that can put all of the P pipeline together and being really useful and at the same time during my kind of like four to five years uh here I also involve lot many large SK can project for example this non cccc published last year in the sale report medicine is actually based on another sale paper published several years ago by our lab we have extend the cohort and do includ more um different kind of a tumor and perform like different kinds of a ptn together to do a quantitive analysis the other project I have is like L cinoma is an intentional collaboration project with Taiwan team so overall this kind of a collaboration usually involves more than like at least like 20 or 30 30 people a time I feel like it's really hard to even like communicate saying that I want to do this we can s of like more than three way or four ways to do analysis so if we can have a common language in in a sense of a software then probably we are more possible to reproduce our result those paper are pretty big but when you want to reproduce it you you send an email to a corresponding Al you realize now this every pan probably come from different Au that's just really hard to reproduce all all the stuff so we investigate a little bit like how many different software out there and what's the existing software and for publication and also probably just general academic thing is we want to find some amending um needs that we can improve so we realize lots of people still use like old technique like labor fortification but other software only supportless and we want to support other like TNT and Dia as I mentioned earlier and the field also U since prom is a technique kind of um different from like experiment design really depend some like what kind of readout you want you probably want to focus on some of a residue of a protein or even a peptide so some of a reent CH is are we able to do a peptide level conic and also like do analysis at P because um when you use ms1 MS2 to do like protein quantification this are actually a step called protein protein inference that will take a pep type but those pep type might not um just only map to one protein so the assignment of the protein is actually ambiguous thing and sometimes we know it might make some mistakes so some people will feel like probably go back to P label and design any kind of AC at a paper label might be of the interest so P label communication is something we want to incover it another kind of A change is lots of a protein will goes through post transational modification they are really size specific we want to look into like different mechanism for example fation is one particular make is and only particular M residue will be the focus and every protein they have many residue can be fast uh F Rel so we want want to do some um analysis at a size specific lbel so here is a kind of R Casing but they just summarize what we observe and being the objective of our project so overall um from this publication that we recently published we come out two different tool since this is to tag uh seminar I want to um mention this in the beginning we have a two different tool out of the publication one is the faers is the major thing I will discuss today is wave interface and other by informatic student you might have much more programming experience than forr is a more advanced tool is our package you can use it I think that's generally our recommendation and both project are open open source and we are still active developing so if you have any request you can Conta us and we can fix about those things together even hyper collaboration so another thing I want to highlight before jump into the research detail I really like to the this kind of things since the kind of followup uh with like my learning experience in the dcmb is a tool that we kind of build and test across many different dcmb class and now is with much more um attention originally it's kind of like C I just notice list one paper I like kind I kind of like how they are doing but I want to improve that and later I present those things in the lab and we find well it's actually an interest in the lab that we probably want to incorporate so I start doing some prototype and then even like since we have some student taking our class on on prois part so we we release this prototype to student then student can test and then further since as a by informatic student I also want to do more coding a little bit so in the class like in sh by Le instructure before is like 576 is Opex development so I put this project into it and then further even like this semester as a GSI I also like release another kind of a new feature and can be tested in the in the homework and these two are kind of been highlight in several different way in the field we kind of get one probably un most popular U unofficial blog post on this one and also from the journal is the most read article in the past 30 days yeah so back to a topic F just as overview of of f it only takes two inut it's not really okay but um we want to make it as accessible as possible because when people are looking at data they might in field for example my collaborator some of are doctor some of P pathologist if find they they find it really hard to just work on the Excel table they might have like some knowledge but if you have a interactive platform then it's easier for them to go through a thing so generally they have two inutes so report and the other is annotation and here is like General fixy over of over higho view we take those thing together and since Poma have lots of a missing value so we sometimes want to do missing value filtering only keep some of the feature you have confident and you can do anization even like do imputation imputation is a kind of I I always say it's a double Ed sometime it gives you good result sometimes is just you introduce some arual thing into a data so you need to very very careful but in terms of I have a just a straightforward pl we still put in there is optional and then those things after doing those thing we can do a differential expression analysis and then further enrichment analysis and not not specific like a sequential role here quality contr and H also being applied together and generally this kind of prep Anis is Implement in our shiny app so it's web accessible and we can host it if you have a web server and we are actually kind of expanding this infrastructure to see we are able to help as many user as possible and so here is another of the condision table division table if you are more familiar with the trans data it's not pretty different it's just a protein um multiply by sample matric so the your Jour will have some header like or some additional metadata like a different database ID and The exper annotation is something more important since sometimes like programming tool l or like doing D analysis you you want to name the sample differently we have a sample and column and we also have a condition that's a major comparison since lots of a project I involve like C mentioned earlier like caner project we focus on like what's the difference between the tumor versus like a layer normal adjacent tissue or even like compared to different Ty of tumor so we want to set that the different condition and replicate col is another way um to like in for example some people will kind of have a replicate in the cohort but in this sample I didn't have many replicate on only only one here but generally this kind of another column when you kind of do a visualization you wanton let the user to switch back and forth to see if they have like B course replicate and to demonstrate the um like a functionality of a F this we kind of find several high profile journal and find their data interesting and we putting together and they rely on a little bit different exper design and so we see it's also a good introduction to people even like a beginner of a p fi they might learn some a little bit more about like M can also being used to prop a different biological question uh here is a overview of L set it can basically divide into a five part I will introduce every part later but the general idea here I want to mention is that many kinds of a consideration in our tool design we we've been covered in this example and I will start with the CC CC1 this is a first sale one of the sale manuscript we publish and they they have three different example here but I will go through two of them first but just general idea this is a cancer cohor so is we are studying one major K cancer type called CLE cell renal cell carcinoma and in this cohor we have some tumor and also normal adjacent tissue and other kind of like Quality quality control SC we incorporate QC sample into it and then um the data wastified by TNT and Dia together they have a pretty complex workflow so so it could what I can collect part of a sample in the beginning using theia and the rest of a sample will be used to have a higher depth of a protein coverage using tnd data and we in this workflow we also able to uh profile some of a p and here is a fastor relation so I will start with a basic example is still doing the global proteon quantification and collect tndt uh in collecting in the tndt data so we just choose a subset as a demonstration we take a subset that's around like four out of 23 templex experience and we put it together do a search and after get report we bit of The experim annotation and we can submit to a fist and then in in the f anal we will able to see some of the um analysis being part one of example is a PCA P so in the PCA part we are able to like is a principal component analysis usually we will use this to to kind of investigate if you have a b f or you have a expect separation um on the on your like prot quantification result but one drawback is in this principal component analysis you expect your Matrix need to be like complete so you cannot really have any missing value so that's one of a drawback so but at the same time if you doing like a correlation he you can use a pairwise u correlation so if the sample still measure particular feature between the two different sample you can still try to calculate layer calculation together so it's another way to do quality control so as as a result here you can see like QC sample and tumor and N or I can just simply call it as a normal have a well separate result even like a correlation key map that could consider almost all feature you have in the match still shows that they are separate together so generally it looks pretty good say as a demonstration over data quality of the experience and a further investigation we one particular example we can demon is in this kidy cancer coh um we actually accidentally collect some of us KY cancer not cell but is other sub type so clle people they have their own usage of a biomarker probably they they really well known so they will investigate a bit to kind of rual B to see if they are kind of like being like anything wrong in the beginning so here we also have a availability you can just choose several bi markers like well known while defining the field and looking into it so here is a example like P we finally one uh one sample in this um um four PL they have like one example that is since not like clear cell and you can also visualize this through the H map you will notice this is one example here like shows like a bit different pattern so we are able to demonstrate in this procedure U you are able to find some outlier and they can support some of the C anales you want to perform on your data set and and and after removing those QC and potentially not p r cell Casa simple then people the first STP of biological question you ask is how much different between the tumor and so if you annotate those samples correctly the this P will also been show up so you are able to see some of the U things difference comes out comes out between tumor versus comparison and so this um differential expression analysis we can also perform the enrichment analysis based on like AR regul gen or down reg and do and perer the over representation test and overall we the the message we want to say is if you go back check the cell manuscript they report several findings for example tumor that have a well separation they have a particular biological PA W kind like difference or some of the mar they from of the interest all this we can use a subset of the sample and we provide like tutorials thing people can reproduce just use the subset of the data and generally speaking they are really consistent and we are able to show that you you can use this tool to generate some of the thought that been published in the U the earlier self manuscript and U since I mentioned tnd earlier um and on this cohort we also have a Dia data so we also try a bit to see if this Dia data is useful or we the same SC and we perform the same analysis and here is just example P the PC Plus and the coration they are generally generally pretty SAR to a TNT but just as a reminder D and TNT they are different um playform so people generally think that quantification doing by the DIA is much relable compared to a TNT TNT will have like ratio comparion if you have a further question we can discuss uh later and but here is another uh slides showing like those thing we are able to reproduce so right now I cover the first two example here I need to like jump a little bit far away from the CLE cell cell cinoma Cort I I'm going to introduce a different kinds of a m technique so apms apms is a f purification Mass special machine it's a common strategy to profile the prot protein interaction and how that works is you will have a immobilized B protein in like like like lock on on a surface and then you will use your prot mixture Matrix to FL through this um like like colon thing and then you can are able to capture some of the interaction will be um stay in the column and you can take those samples and go to uh for the digest and do the M experience and so experience experience so um this way is another is kind of a to profile Pro P interaction and they have many statistical procedure to been proposed to study this question even for our lab we have we have kind of further tool to do apms analysis but we are also interested to see if this fre is able to reproduce some of our result so we choose this um um paper publishing U I think in science is a labor forication PMS in data and look into head and neck cancer and and looking at one particular driver in this disease so we take subset of this driver um exper and do a reanalysis so uh go through a similar procedure you upload PR conation table and also exal design we are able to generate those and those up regul par means they have more interaction between bait and and those your sample of putting in the sample show are in the upper right part and this result is kind of consistent with if I apply a well established tool publish by our lab earlier they they they are pretty consistent C they you can see like CK one b or one c l c CD ck2 they will go com out and you you go back to find like near original science publication this example also Illustrated so generally speaking even like by simple um procedure we are able to reproduce some another this uh inms iser and one consideration when you use this apms protocol is this apms protocol usually is label free so they have lot more missing value and people in one way like the the just here we use imputation data but some people will also feel like it's not safe and generally and and I will also say you need to investigate a a bit to see your imputation doesn't in like influence your conclusion on the data so as a way to support this kind of need in development another modu in this forness to look into just look into the prot compation and they will only relies on identify data so so this kind of L PL or like filter and P diagram we are able to reproduce some of the candidate can only been found in the ccnd D1 b 14 sample and this 24 so kind of overlay with early candidate so this is just another way for people to do analysis so here is um so now I also need to switch the topic to the other one this Li Ms Li Ms is a example of a paper label analysis this is the general procedure and the kind the kind of course uh concept of this part is when you use Li Ms we want to understand some PR t if they are influenced by pupation for example if if you have a drug add into a sample if they can cause some structural change of the protein so um the reason this kind of thing work is we will use one kind of a partise this partise is not really specific to um U like trip triptic or enzy since they are unspecific but they only cut the um peptide out of a protein because they are accessible so we are able to see if those accessible and fible region will be changing before the treatment and control samples so here is a sample we got it from our cator and and pre previous application so we in this work they are interesting one of a um drug called reprising This is an inhibitor and they wonder if there are some Target will been changed due to this pation so in the exper they will have a reing treatment group and also the control group and then they will independently go through the lims protocol so after you suming again like after you summon the protein conation T pation table in this case since we want to understand if ler particular region on one per Target being influenced by this peration so we will use the peptide label quantification uh quantification table and annotation together submit to a f and this and then we can get similar get a result similarly and then here is the thing we uh show in the in the left hand side in the original study they also show kind of SAR panel one thing we want to um kind of improve is um you might interest in one on pep typ since they are up reg but you want to see like how much changes been being introduced in other ptip conf from the same protein since they are the same protein Target so we actually make this functionality like intive one you click one of a um pep feature then they will highlight other feature come from SLE together kind of replicate the analysis they perform in the origal manuscript and we look into a part a particular protein Target called f kb18 that's one of the target protein of Interest So based on off result this protein sequence changes between the treatment versus control is kind of similar to what reported in the original study unfortunately we are not bble to like do this like side by side so it's kind of you need to visually to see like some of a region is a same they use a different prot um protein search engine so so it's kind of it's you see some discording some region PR on this part of the prot sequence so now we are finally here U the the final example for showing the F this or more for the analy are so when we develop the f anal I think the general mindset is we want to help the user result programming background but as by informatic student I find lots of thing I want to put into a publication need to be report several times so if we are able to generate a uh kind of like more like a mature software product like a package that might be better so let's the way um that I further after I develop the web interface I focus on PR analy are is our package and one benefit that if you can program you can actually change some of the order of this procedure since for different application you might have other interest and you might apply like additional filtering so we makeing this plug a modular so you can switch back and forth uh just programming but in the original F balance you are only able to define a fixy pipeline that probably most people will do but in your application probably doesn't work and one of the interesting things is doing the size PDM analysis it's kind of increasing um got attention so we want to incover some of the analysis so here we take SI specific pulation as a example in this part we kind of design for the module we can take a size specific um prot vation result and join together with a goal as diation together to do analysis you can still perform a differential expression analysis but further since they are size specific we can take particular fosil side and they F change and submit those to enrichment analysis and then get a result that if there are some kindness of Interest shows are because we Abol solution site and the reason we want to apply this kind of a putting data together is um since we notice that if you just do analysis on Origin without any normalization against the abundance the full change will basic follow uh the full change of size B relation will kind of follow goal prot is kind of expected because if you have more protein even though they don't have much vation they still have a higher chance get to a m analyzer and get analyze so parent protein abundance will largely bias your quantification result of a velation so here we we'll do a simple regression to kind of Corr those correlation between the protein and vas relation and normaliz you can see the full Trend between tumor versus normal they are no longer no longer correlate so we think that it might be better to capture some of theological synal but generally I think doing this such analysis will will suggest you need to do both since some of them although is kind of generated by the protein parent protein aeration is still might have a biological effect so here is like a overview if you Sr we can still do like um e analysis we compare before and after normalization they are really still like well separate even we remove those prot abundance changes so they suggest they are really active protein filation and my influence on cell signal in the in the cancer versus normal in this case and um similar functionality as I Dem earlier but now you can do it like in in in a script that you can pull some of a marker previous propose and see if they are really um differentially expressed between the conditions so as you can see on the left hand side box spot so some of the um for bation marker report in the earlier s manuscript seems to like have a differential expression uh result in in original analysis but if you remove those protein abundant CH some of the some of the sites will no longer become the differential Express but some of the side still over interest since after remove the protein abundance they they still really differential Express within there might indicate some of a different regulation on those sites and might be of the interest to further l through it and as uh last part after we get the differential expression analysis result on the filation we can submit into a sfic enrichement tool for now we only focus on filation since not many other DM have this SI enrichement tool we can use but here we demonstrate we can use two different tool and then they have a pretty similar result and really comparable result but I show here we incorporate some ofation but some of the candidate like at2 um shows are consistent across the two different software um they have a different enrichment um procedure but overall we find this ak2 is of interest and when we go back to a literature is really interesting this akt2 is also reported in other um renal cell cinoma study so we kind of see that it's kind of of interest and we might have further other project to look into this detail so until now I kind of demonstrate all the five example we incorporate in the manuscript and I want to make a summary here that we S A analysis to for the pr user Community to S perform down analysis after running effect by F support all vure quation workflow including DDA and Dia label reification and also TNT and over a range of functionality includ including like exp varation and even like prep level analysis and in addition to PR I also Dev application called are they could in basically cover all the functionality of F and support specific PDN enrichment analysis we are still active working on it but I think we are really getting there and there are many future work for example like feature as a um a good we are also having a whole facility we have we have lots of request for generally acir control report so I'm still working on Jour some modu like can gener lo secury report like concisely and more P level analysis since we noticed that K feel also have much moreel analysis we want to achieve and including the imun pep analysis and more refined PD analysis for PDN other fation also of interest and and in addition to pomis some of the project I mention earlier like non cccc or Nona is it generally speaking is also a prot genomics project all that means is it has a genomic andic data so we want to have some integration together with L data and in the operation site we we also get a request from the Galaxy GOP that we might incorporate our software to in the Galaxy a server is another big bi informa suit and scouting the server for more request is also one of the top pror item in my list since after the publication I I I think user crash server a lot like I need to face every week yeah but um so in the last I want to acknowledge all the people not only dcnb but also the DC uh my dissertation committee lab and umage Bri Tech group and also many CB Tech group we focus on many different cancer at the same time and every working group we have so many carees I not L see here and but since thanks everyone for helping on this project and so here is all my presentation thank you for listening I'm feel free to ask any question and I also put my prance to link here and happy Halloween thank you for your next talk um I'm just curious about um the potential of the analysis for identifying iforms for you mean like in this publication or or general um so well I mean we we we did identify different pepti isop form possibly so the prom data but it really depends on how much you think that's real and and if you want to identify isopor then you need to pull isopor into the database but for in this sample we we use the database like reduce a lot of B so generally speaking we can find Lo things and Ne anen is based like I think I mentioned here if you want to find a NE antigen in the promis part we will use like imum experience and in that part the quantification or database building is also different since General Global prote om data showing here no matter it's goal proteon or filation they will will be tributed that Jets but for imun Pon data they are more like dir and Rich and not really cutting by different design so it's specific search so but our B have ability to do that but for down analysis I think it's still actually developing in one of my cancer project I also work on some data so if you have further question we can discuss later like how to use our um tool to do analysis I Gilbert has a question I just can you hear me yeah yeah I can hear you so very very nice presentation and I commend you for staying well within your time too so I hope you stimulate a lot of questions I'm interested you've done so much work on phosphorilation but we do have data sets mostly from our collaborating Labs on glycosilation cellation ubiqutination maybe other things still on the work works so for the PTM analysis where do you see the next most interesting work going next and what are you specifically working on I think your r package is especially suited for PTM studies is that right yeah yeah I think that's a very good question for me I think iation will be the most interesting one since compared to other example you mentioned like isolation or ulation they are another layer of a complexity since not only a size specific PT and gation they will modify on a side but even on a side they have so many different complexity layer you can have a longer guy can or shorter gu can although in this workflow most ofit protocol we are only able to get a composition but even the different composition on the single S I think most of people are not using it for large scale analysis so I think for development I will focus focus on this first since they also kind of explore another layer of complexity compared to other PTM and which Labs have made the most special uses New Uses of uh frag pipe I think you mean like or FR by pipeline yeah yeah I think I mean in my understanding I would say chemal fi so that's why I this some of like P level analysis like 16 label in retive and not still one active region like of interest and some ofation uh work also cont us to do a thing so I think that's a major user but a from the cancer or other disease I think this another big user community and this something we want to end for very good thanks yeah thank you g Li talk and I'm curiously about the post post translation modifications as you the uh transcript dats and data they are sometimes not really correlated because of some translation modations or degraded yeah so in know tools is there any single or some UT off some you could identify some symbol of the uh uh of the of the one theti of their trans oh uh I think that's an interesting idea we have a I think I have a kind of modu but it's a little bit different from you are asking I think you are asking like kind of like discordant between like post CH modification at a prot level compared to like modification but I think there is a fundamental thing is an and protein they are also not correlate for example recently we started doing some analysis in meoma meoma is a cancer that with high tumor Purity ler protein on quation correlation is really good probably 0.67 in terms of appear correlation but if you look at prate cancer the correlation could go down like 0.1 so even go to even before go to the ptn label I think the regulation between the an and prot 14 will goes to like like deg degradation that you will not estimate on level I think this original is already a big difference so I I think we we have a correlation analysis for for Mar for for that but go to a pan side I think that's a little bit far I think I I think I can think about it but but for now I was think like even protein level not even like side level will be something of your Ines but degradation uh the degradation is definitely play a role I think um you might want to like F into it any other questions not seeing or hearing any other questions so let's thank one more time thank you
