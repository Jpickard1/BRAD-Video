Ray do you want to wait just another like minute or so to get started yeah that sounds good okay in um okay I we're probably at steady state cool great um so so my name is Patrick kinan and I'm a fourth year PhD student in the chemical engineering department um I'm in Dr Jennifer Linderman's lab and I'm also very closely advised by DRS Gary and Kathy luer um Ray do you want to introduce yourself and get us started yeah so my name is Raymond darari I'm a third year PhD student same situation as Patrick um advised by Dr Jennifer Linderman in the chemical engineering department but we work really closely with Dr Gary and Dr Kathy lucer in the department of radiology and I think it's safe to say that we're really excited to talk to you today about some of the collaborative work that we've been doing between both of these Labs um focusing on experimental and modeling techniques to understand cell signaling um one thing before we get started if you have any questions since there's two of us we can monitor the chat um and so if you have any clarifying questions please feel free to type them in the chat throughout the talk and there will be plenty of time for questions at the end as well yeah absolutely so I want to broadly talk about heterogenity in the context of cancer because cancer is a heterogeneous disease so tumors are composed of various cell types and environmental structures that create variations in the tumor micro environment so in this cartoon on the right I'm showing you some of these tumor features that they consist not only of these cancer cells that I've highlighted in blue but also stromal cells in yellow and immune cells and uh Vas UL that I've outlined in red and we're curious about how all of these different components interact with each other but we're really specifically interested in understanding cancer cell behaviors but you'll notice that even if we look just at the cancer cells which we're interested in they're not homogeneous in and of themselves so in this schematic although all of the cancer cells are blue genetic differences and things like that really really give these cancer cells different properties so we can think about these variations under a couple of different buck get genetic differences between different types of cancers um epigenetic differences in gene expression and also environmental differences that alter the way a cell is poised to function so instead of having a cluster of cancer cells that look like this you can imagine a group of cells that looks more like this with all sorts of different behaviors depending on the genetic and environmental inputs so just to make this really clear the diversity that we're seeing in these cancer cells um comes from genetically inherited variations and also across environmental plasticity so for example if we follow the trajectory of one of these blue cancer cells we can see an example where it divides into two cells one of which is really similar to the parent in bless and the other which is incredibly different and red and this could be a genetic or epigenetic difference in the regulation of uh gene expression but we can also look at variations from environmental plasticity so let's suppose that both of these cancer cells are all of a sudden placed next to a stromal cell we might see the blue cell shift from a blue to a black color phenotype while the red cell is for whatever reason not disposed to change in the presence of this neighbor and furthermore we can think about different chemicals or biochemical inputs in the cell environment so this could be a drug or a chemokine which we're really particularly interested in um secreted by different cells in the tumor micro environment and in the presence of one of these chema kinds this black cell might die and not be able to contribute to the progression of the tumor but the red one could go on to continue and survive and proliferate and so here hopefully you're beginning to see just how difficult cancer treatment is in these heterogeneous populations of cells because therapies don't affect all of these cells equally so small subpopulations of cancer cells like this red one are the ones that really Drive disease progression so you can think about drug resistance or this red cell being the one that's able to escape the primary tumor survive in the immune system and then colonize a new metastatic site to make can cancer lethal so it's important for us to understand how these single cells and rare populations make decisions that promote cancer survival so one of the ways that cancer cells do this that our lab studies is the way that they respond to gradients of uh chemicals like cxcl12 which are present in the tumor micro environment so here I want to introduce the concept of receptor mediated cell signaling which is how cells take in information about their environment through receptors on their surface and convert that information into behavioral responses like promoting migration so in this case you can see a gradient of cxcl12 in yellow that binds to this cognate ligan cxcr4 on the red cell surface uh which ultimately leads to Downstream oncogenic behaviors that we want to understand and control but this process to control behavioral responses is actually really complicated and just because one ligan binds to a receptor it doesn't mean that we'll see the same oncogenic behavior happen in different groups of cells so that gets us into different cell signaling behaviors so there are numerous signaling Pathways inside of the cell and phosphorilation and different modifications that go on to activate specific signaling Pathways and two of these Pathways that we study are akt and irk which are turned on by kinas activation Downstream of the receptor ligan binding event and these Pathways akt and irk are constitutively active in many cancers and typically they're tied to phenotypes like cancer migration and other metastatic behaviors which you can see on the right so research efforts to control these different behaviors tend to focus on blocking one or both of these signaling Pathways but again they're really intricately connected and not exclusive components that are tied to cancer behaviors so what we're really hoping to do here is understand single cell responses in these Pathways how they're connected to each other um and how they fit into the larger signaling landscape and we think that monitoring these Dynamic signaling responses will help us to control and treat cancer so Central to the work that we'll talk a little bit more about today really is cancer cell signaling so we'll touch more on some of the experimental approaches and modeling tools that we use to study these data uh but ultimately we're interested in looking at these signaling Dynamics linking that to linking that heterogenity to precursors like things differences in genetic inheritance chemokine exposure um and environmental plasticity and we also want to be able to model and use these signaling Dynamics as sort of inputs to final cancer phenotypes such as migration and proliferation and resistance and ultimately answer questions like why do cells respond differently to the same stimulus and um how do these responses change in different environments for example so ultimately we have lots of pieces of information that we want to combine uh to understand sources of heterogeneity and inform mechanistic cancer treatment and so now I'll hand it over to Patrick to talk more about our experimental Pipeline and some of our preliminary modeling efforts thanks Ray um so okay I'm I'm controlling race screens so there's a little bit of a lag so hopefully Rey convinced you that it's really important to measure signaling Dynamics in individual cells so that we can understand heterogeneous behaviors in cancer I want to give a brief rundown of how we do that so the general flow is that we need to in a specific cell line of interest in our case we use several different breast cancer cell lines we need to express fluorescent reporters then we need to be able to do high throughput automated fluorescence micr opy to take fluorescent images of those cells and it really helps in this process to have an automated image processing pipeline which allows us to automatically extract data from these images so I'm going to go through each of these steps in more detail first I want to talk about the reporters that we use they're called kyes translocation reporters or ktrs uh the name stems from the fact that they are responsive to kyes which are proteins that phosphorate are the proteins in the cell akt and irk are both kinases and the translocation refers to the fact that as is shown in this diagram in the top right when the Kines is activated the fluorescent signal will move from the cytoplas or from the nucleus to the cytoplasm so on the left here you've got a cell that has low irk and most of the signal is in the nucleus when IR gets activated by for instance the addition of cf2 uh we we see that signal move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm one major benefit of this reporter strategy is that multiple reporters can be used in a single cell since each reporter only takes up one fluorescent channel so in our cells we have the irk KTR in the yellow channel so it's attached to Yellow fluorescent protein and we have the akt KTR attached to a cyan fluorescent protein so that's in the blue Channel um so in one cell we're able to monitor irk and akt activity at the same time so in this hypothetical cell most of the yellow signal that we would see is in the nucleus but most of the blue signal is in the cytoplasm indicating that this uh this individual cell has high akt activity and low irk activity at this particular time um we express the measurements of Ky activity uh using what we call the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio or the CNR so to do that we take the intensity of signal in the cytoplasm divide it by the intensity of signal in the nucleus and then we take the log base two of that which centers that value around zero we call that the CNR so if you hear me say CNR High means that the chinise is active and low means that the chinise is inactive so when we have these cells that are expressing fluorescent reporters we next do high throughput microscopy on them so we seed cells in 96 well plates um each well might have a different cell type or a different uh condition then in each well we can do time-lapse Imaging before and after a stimulus is applied so we would image cells in media um we might give them a different dose of cxl2 or we might give them an inhibitor um the output of this process is a series of fluorescent time-lapse images so for each well we would have images of the cells in the akt channel the Earth Channel and also a nuclear marker Channel which is red uh the nuclear marker is really important for tracking the cells over time which we'll get to later um I also wanted to talk about the timeline of the experiment so we tend to seed cells around 3 days prior or 72 hours prior to Imaging um over this time they grow we have what we refer to as a precondition which is um just this sort of relative time around 4 hours before we give some stimulus to the cells we might uh give them a different stimulus or an inhibitor um in order to study how they respond to a change in their history and then what we refer to as the zero time is when we actually give the stimulus so there's actually different timelines or different experimental timelines that we use for different questions and so I sort of want to review that here if we want to just measure heterogeneous responses to liant for instance maybe cxl2 uh we would just image the cells right before we give a um a stimulus and right after so maybe for 10 minutes before and maybe for an hour after however we might have a different question which is how does cellular history affect the response to a liant and we would measure that via preconditioning so in this case we might uh measure we might we might image the cells as we give a precondition uh so maybe some inhibitor and then we would uh measure the cell's response for four hours and then we would give a stimulus uh and also measure the response to that now a third experiment that is even a little bit more complex is let's say we wanted to know about how sister cells behave in that case we would track cells for around 24 hours before a stimulus this would allow us to see dividing cells and to know which cells are sisters when we give a stimulus um I do want to point out that as we move down and take more pictures from the top to the bottom the experiments do grow in complexity so it's not like we just want to take pictures of the cells sort of willy-nilly um we try to focus the Imaging that we do to answer a specific question but these are several questions and sort of uh the goal of this is to to give an an intuition of some of the different choices we can make as experimentalists so we do this fluorescence microscopy um what does it actually look like so you can see a still frame of one picture uh this is the irk KTR in mcf7 breast cancer cells so I've uh there's there's maybe a dozen cells in this slide I've indicated five of them with arrows um the ones with red arrows you can see have mostly nuclear signals so you can see this uh this bright Circle in a with with a uh less bright haze around it um so these cells would have low irk however there are a couple other cells over here on the right and on the bottom indicated with blue arrows and you'll notice that in those cells you can't really see the nucleus stick out so they have a uh a more even ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear signal uh this indicates that these cells are more off um or they're sorry they're more on compared to the cells where the nucleus is really bright so we can already see even in still shots that we can start to see some heterogeneity in um in these cells so on the next slide side um I'm going to try a video uh not sure how well it will work for everybody so I've also put still frames on the right so I'm going to walk through the still frames first and then play the video a couple times so in the top right we've got those same cells uh this is their initial signal um again you can see some cells are on uh some cells are off so there's some heterogenity there uh about 3 hours after this picture in the top right was taken we added EGF to the cells um EGF is another uh liant it strongly activates the Earth and akt Pathways uh and it's related to growth and um will make cancer cells divide so when we give EGF we can see all of the signal go from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in almost every cell um so you know these kind of look like donuts um we can see the nucleus is maybe darker in some cells than others so there's still some heterogen there but what's interesting is that if we look at the cells 2 hours after EGF is given we can see this cell on the right uh still looks like a donut its nucleus is still sort of hollowed out meanwhile this cell on the bottom left has a super bright nucleus so this says that the cell in the top right is still really really active in the earth pathway two hours after EGF was applied well this other cell has essentially entirely turned the Earth pathway off um this sort of naturally leads to questions about what causes the Persistence of those signaling of of that signaling pathway um so I'm going to play the video and we'll see some some other behaviors um uh I'm going to okay there it is so I'm going to play this um I'll play it a few times I would suggest just picking out a couple cells to look at and notice the flickering of the kyes activity and then the very concerted um move of the signal from the nucleus into the cytoplasm as um oh I lost it um as EGF is applied okay so you can see um at the end you know a lot of the cells are or a lot of the signal is mostly in the cytoplasm I'll play it again um and you can see some flickering too of uh or some pulses of work activity as the cells are sort of just uh resting they're sort of unperturbed um okay and so just to uh just to to finish this out um so you can see right before the stimulus was applied again lots of the cells have um lots of the cells have nuclear signal and if I just move forward a little bit um right after EGF is applied you can see every cell has all of the signal in the cytoplasm indicating that they are strongly active um so after we're done looking at these really cool videos um as I said we have this automated image processing pipeline um so this pipeline was developed almost entirely by Kathy lcer um selftaught mat lab expert uh it's incredibly I would say it's invaluable it is uh necessary to do this work um so as I said from these videos uh or from this video microscopy we get multiple fluorescent channels and we have time-lapse images so the first step in the image processing pipeline is a process that we call nuclear masking so we create a binary image from the nuclear channel that tells us where the nuclei are uh then we take those nuclei and we expand them a little bit uh this approximates the shape of the cytoplasm remember we need to get signal in the ktrs from both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in order to extract the chinise activity um so that tells us the kyes activity of individual cells at individual times but remember we're interested in the Dynamics of these cells so how they change over time to answer that question we need to connect the nuclei through time so I've Illustrated this process on the right um in the the blue circles would be the nuclei from frame let's say frame 10 and the red circles would be the nuclei from frame 11 and you can see uh the the nuclei will generally overlap and so we use that to track the cells uh there's some other more complex methods that are based on probability in case there is no no overlap U but generally we're able to connect the nuclei through time in order to create dynamic tracks of kyes activity so what does the data actually look like well as I said in this cartoon let's say we've got three cells um we can get their akt and irk activity over time in each individual cell so uh this this first cell maybe has relatively high akt at the start and then its akt and irk turn on over time uh maybe in the second cell it's got lower akt activity at the start but it strongly activates akt meanwhile in a third cell there's just no akt activity at all um so this is just three cells uh in reality we are often times able to get several hundred if not several thousand cells in one experiment and in one condition so uh it's not really feasible to look at uh just line graphs or or or Scatter Plots for for thousands of cells so we represent the data a little bit differently so we do that using what we call color Maps or chog graphs I've also heard them referred to as um they're kind of complicated so I want to break them down step by step on the Y AIS of these color Maps we have individual cells so going from 1 to 840 cells that were gathered in this experiment so each row in this color map is an individual cell now along the x-axis we have time going from zero to around 250 minutes uh and then going from Z to 250 minutes again uh the two columns refer to the akt and irk channels respectively on the left and the right um so what this means is that for an individual cell at an individual time the color corresponds to its akt or irk activity respectively um low CNR or low AK activity is dark blue and high is red and so what this shows us is that there is heterogeneity in the starting state of both irk and akt you can see that some cells have like sort of a yellow um akt value going all the way down to Blue um and in irk cell are generally lower um maybe the strongest cells are sort of light blue and the the um most off cells are are very dark blue um we can also see a concerted rise when we add EGF around 180 minutes so that's over here on the right uh but within this we can also see some heterogen so there's lots of different starting States for Ur AK and also some cells uh activate and are really dark red whereas other cells are um you know right here they're just they they activate but they only make it to sort of green or or yellow um so they're they're clearly degrees of activation that are captured by these uh ktrs and represented in these color Maps so when we get all this data the next question is sort of what do you do with it um the first thing you might try is to just take the average and that's not the worst thing to do it certainly tells you some things but I'm going to tell you it obscures signaling heterogenity so to show you how that kind of works I've plotted the mean and the 25th and 75th percentile of akt and irk activity from the previous graph so this does show us that akt indeed starts higher than irk um in these cells it also shows us that when you give EGF you see a really strong rise in both akt and irk and it's a bigger rise in irk um it also maybe even tells us that the variance decreases I don't know the width between the 25th and 75th percentile maybe gets smaller after you add EGF so certainly not uh no information but it does raise a question um do any cells actually behave like this uh black line and the answer is generally no very few cells do um so here I've superimposed three cells in green red and blue and their actual trajectory and so when you look at these you see um strong fluctuations in both akt and irk some of that is for sure noise from the detector um or from the image processing but the image processing is pretty good so some of these are actually real fluctuations in akt and Ark behavior um and what this shows is that if we want to really understand the the the behaviors that these cells are exhibiting we need to understand each cell individually we can't just sort of lump them together and use um sort of population based statistics or if we do decide to do that we'll be missing a lot of information so one way we can do that is uh for many bioinformatics people in here this this will make sense um if you have a high dimensional data set a first um a great way to make sense of it at first is to do dimensionality reduction so that's what I'm going to talk about on this slide um there's one little wrinkle and that is that whereas something like a gene expression data set might just have you know a 100 or a thousand genes in it um with different observations um in that data set the order that the genes are presented in doesn't really matter uh however in our data set the data is fundamentally ordered um in that there is time you you can't just swap the order of when the observations were were obtained or else you sort of destroy the the time uh dependence in the data so we use a technique called functional principal component analysis it's an extension of PCA um or principal component analysis to temporal data and we applied PCA in this case to a data set where we stimulate cells with uh CX2 now one interesting thing about this data is we were able to segregate the cells based on whether they expressed the receptor cxcr4 or not this is really important because if you don't express CX4 there's no way that the cells could sense cxcl2 so when we do fpca on this data and we color the cells by whether they are X4 positive or X4 negative we see two General populations of data so up here on the left this Red Cloud is uh cxcr4 negative so no receptor and we see this blue cloud stretching down and to the right those are the X4 positive cells one thing that I do want to point out though is that lots of the blue cells overlap with the red cells so just like in PCA we can take all of these individual uh PCA scores and we can see okay what Dynamics led to them so when we do that we see that the center of this blue cloud is a cell that strongly responds in the akt channel whereas the center of the Red Cloud is a cell that doesn't respond at all but remember lots of blue cells that do have the receptor are also in this Red Cloud so they're also not responding this uh has a sort of natural biological interpretation which is that the receptor cxcr4 is necessary but is not sufficient to Signal there's there must be something else in between um CX 4 and irk and akt that is making the cells not signal so we can show the data again on a color map and we can see uh these are the cells in this case they've been segregated by the their X4 status so all of the cells shown here have cxcr4 uh we can see some cells start green up here on the top left and they strongly activate akt uh going up to dark red uh other cells um sort of down here in the bottom uh they barely respond to cxcr4 so again we see this observation that receptor is not just because you have the receptor doesn't mean that you'll respond to CX to CX2 so a previous student in the group Phil Spinosa built an ordinary differential equation model to understand why some cells don't respond and other cells strongly respond so I'm not going to go deep into the the equations in this model but we can see that CX2 and cxcr4 receptor ligant interactions are represented up here at on top and the two species that we have ktrs for akt and irk are down here on the bottom so each arrow on this plot is a uh differential equation representing an interaction between proteins we can see that there's numerous species in between cxcr4 and irk and AK uh three of them that I want to call out are Ras mtor 1 and pi3k they have these uh little bubbles on them and those indicate that those are sources of variation in the model so Phil found that those three parameters are largely responsible for variation in akt and irk responsiveness so what I mean by that is that Phil was able to simulate this model with several different parameter ranges for Ras and for one and p3k he did that and since there were three parameters it creates a three-dimensional space so I'm showing that here um it's so the bottom shows the space in three dimensions where m one is on the uh Y axis pi3k is on the x-axis and Ras sort of goes into the screen and on top I've got two different um two different planes running through that surface so on these planes there's these blue and yellow Contours those Contours indicate regions of the model where there's strong akt or irk signaling respectively with akt strong akt activity in blue and strong irk activity in yellow the gray Contours indicate regions of the model where experimental cells actually exist so if we go back to this example where we just had these two cells one that strongly responds to AK and the other one that doesn't we can place them in this space and we get these Contours by placing not just one or two cells but by placing around a thousand cells we can see sort of the The Contours of the population so Phil was able to extract this cell state that was responsible for heterogeneity and signaling and it allowed us to sort of map out where the cells exist um so on top I have that same Contour plot from the previous slide on the bottom I uh have an example of what happens when you precondition cells so this is when you give FBS for four hours um FBS is fetal bovine serum it contains a bunch of growth factors you actually see cells move to a region of much higher responsiveness uh given that akt and irk are responsible for a bunch of anagenic processes we would imagine that cells that are down here are much more dangerous um so this sort of gives meaning to the heter andity that we see so this is uh at this point I've sort of summarized some of the past work that we've done in the lab um and some of the really interesting observations we were able to make from it so Phil uh Phil was able to model sort of so remember we've got this timeline where we seed cells you know three days prior we give a precondition and then a stimulus um Phil was able to model the range of time right around the stimulus so he was able to understand how heterogeneity um he was he was able to understand that cells are in heterogeneous States before a stimulus is applied and that can cause a different response from one cell to another however there are other things that are not included in Phil's model um so for instance in all of this time before the model um we're not explicitly modeling things like cell division or cell cell communication or perhaps even stochastic transitions between states as uh maybe there's a fitness or a selective pressure for cells in the dish that causes them to move from one state to another so clearly we have made some progress in understanding heterogeneous cell signaling but there's lots of other things that we're really interested in understanding because we know that each of the these things is responsible for generating subpopulations of cancer cells that are extremely dangerous and that we want to Target pharmacologically in order to better treat cancer so Rey is going to talk a little bit more about uh some of the future work that we've planned in the lab yeah so thanks Patrick so again the the ordinary differential equation model that Patrick just described is incredibly valuable to contextualize and place cells on that signaling landscape like the one shown here on the right but one of the questions that we want to address specifically is just how that cell state is assigned so for example the two cells highlighted on this plot are in distinct regions of the landscape and we can ask questions about what happened in the history of either of these two cells that caused them to land in these specific regions questions like are they related to each other and how close are they to each other in the dish and are they receiving different cues from their environment and their cell neighbors so broadly we we would like to understand how these cells behave collectively and over a longer time frame and we have the tools to be able to do that so just bringing up this timeline again um we have this OD model to describe signaling right around the stimulus but we want to be able to look way back in time and and Trace cells lineage wise and how they're interacting with their neighbors and their environment and one way that we can integrate all of the signaling data and lineage data and spatial information is by linking our experimental observations with agent-based modeling and this agent-based modeling framework allows us to pose and understand mechanisms behind cell State assignment and generate hypotheses and make predictions about various populations of cells so I'll talk a little bit more about the modeling in a bit but first I wanted to show you some of the preliminary and and ongoing evidence that we're Gathering about cell relationships and signaling that we can use to inform our modeling so really quickly I want to bring your attention back to the image processing pipeline that we had discussed before so so Patrick mentioned how important it is for us to connect nuclei through time during the signaling part of our experiments so that we can trace KTR values and assign them to given cells and not just have a disjointed distribution of signaling values but one addition that we needed to be aware of as we're beginning to image for longer periods of time and look for specific lineage relationships is connecting nuclei through cell divisions as well so during the 4-Hour time course of signaling cells don't usually divide all that much and even if they do we tend to get rid of them from our analysis because um the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio gets a bit unreliable when the nuclear envelope disappears and a cell divides and that's a fine decision to make in that specific scenario because we'll have fewer dividing cells um that we need to throw away relative to the total number of cells in the population but over 24 or 48 Hours of Imaging we don't want to get rid of any cell that was the product of a cell division because we would end up losing a lot of cells and not have relatedness information about them so an additional piece that we implemented into this image processing pipeline again thanks largely to the efforts of Kathy lcer was identifying characteristics of dividing cells and being able to link them through time so when cells divide their nuclei go through these very distinct and really cool morphological changes so you'll see them shrink get really really bright as they duplicate all of their chromatin and then abruptly produce two daughter cells that sort of push away from each other so I'm showing schematically here in frame i+1 uh where the nuclei condensed from Blue to red and then in i+2 where the cells separate into the green daughters uh before we largely used overlap to connect cells through time uh but now we've also implemented some probabilistic methods based on these characteristics of dividing cells to connect nearby cells and Link them after a cell division so next I wanted to show you what this actually looks like in practice mainly because looking at the cells is is really exciting so I'll let this GIF play for a couple of rounds but I want to draw your attention to any one of the dividing cells so you'll see for example this cell in the right uh has a really beautiful trajectory it decides to move up the right side a little bit and then it starts spinning and all of a sudden really really quickly we see it shrink get right and then split into these two separate nuclei um so I'll let you guys watch this video again and you can look at some specific cells or another dividing nucleus um but this the point of this is just to show you uh some of the experimental intricacies that come into play when we're extracting lineage information from our microscopy images as cells are dividing so now that we can track cells over longer periods of time and know how they're related to each other be they sisters or cousins or what have you we can begin looking at relationships between cells and understand how cell signaling behaviors are passed along Family Lines so one key preliminary Insight that we have into lineage influences on Cell behavior is about the similarity of sister signaling so looking at the response curves alone we can pair groups of cells and calculate their squared residuals over the duration of their signaling and an inter interesting observation that we make is that sisters are more highly correlated in their signaling in that they have lower residuals than pairs of random cells throughout the population and if we're thinking about inheritance like a family tree this is a logical and intuitive finding but one that really sets the basis for us to be on the lookout for mechanisms that make sisters more alike than the rest of the population and to be able to quantify this this relationship and how it decays as we move through a cell lineage tree and we can also take this one step further and look at the correlation of sister signaling over time so if you'll recall I mentioned genetic variation as one of the main drivers of heterogeneity in cancer um now in the previous Slide the data suggest that sisters are similar to each other so for whatever reason we're seeing this blue cell divide into two similar daughters that are also blue now over the lifetime of these sister cells you can imagine two different possible possible trajectories one where that be blue behavior is retained over the course of a lifetime and one where that blue Behavior transitions or decays and displays a lack of durability over time and one thing that we can do here with the data we have is look at sister correlation over time to see if one of these Trends uh or to see Trends and look and see if one of these durability mechanisms is more favored than the other and what we see when we look at the data is that the sister cell coordination and signaling really remains consistent over time so in this plot on the right I'm showing you just how correlation varies with age so we have old sisters on the left and younger sister pairs on the right and the sum of the squared residual calculation between each pair is plotted on the Y AIS and the fact that we don't see a strong correlation between sister age and the residual calculation calculation suggests that the first mechanism is at play otherwise we might see younger sisters signal more similarly than older sisters for example and this opens up the floor for for many more questions that we can ask specifically about what factors are inherited that cause this similarity now when a cell divides it duplicates all of its contents and certain proteins may be distributed evenly or differentially between the sisters uh but we can also connect this back to the ordinary differential equation model and ask which specific signaling pathway components are responsible for this Behavior so if you'll recall there are three values that really determine the cell signaling profile um and various combinations of inheritance between those three components might be responsible for the behaviors that we see and so really understanding these uh types of questions about inheritance are questions that we have along with a a lot more and and we're really excited to explore um explore these questions with experimental and and modeling techniques down the road and we're not only interested in understanding lineage relationships between cells but also environmental impacts as well so it's well documented in the literature that stromal cell interactions are really crucial in regulating cancer cell signaling so stromal cells and cancer Associated fiber Blast for example secrete cxcl12 in the tumor micro environment so it's it's not a coincidence that we also stimulate our cells with cxl2 to see them signal oncogenically it's because cxl2 tends to be a large component of the metastatic Niche um and additionally physical contact with stromal cells might Force cells into having different behaviors um sort of in the way that at a crowded party you might be at heightened alert as opposed to when you're alone in your room during the day so if we go back to this cartoon that I've included with cancer cells in the center and stromal cells outside uh we're hypothesizing that interactions between these groups of cells is going to be different based on on where they're located physically so you can imagine this inner region of blue cells that's completely shielded from the green stromal cells will behave differently than the red region of cells directly in contact with stromal cells and again this brings up a number of different questions like what if there are several layers of cells or what if a single stromal cell gets inside um so these are the questions we have sort of thinking about in the in the back of our mind but I want to show you how we go about approaching this experimentally so in our experimental pipeline we can co-culture cancer cells with stromal cells and here you can see stromal cell nuclei highlighted in green and cancer cell nuclei either highlighted in blue or red and we Define these colors to represent cancer cells that are either exposed to stromal cells or protected from directed stro direct stromal cell contact according according to some thresholds that we set up and as you can see in this plot on the right the mean signaling behavior for each of these groups protected or exposed cancer cells is different in both akt in the blue and in irk in the yellow and orange um and this again lets us begin thinking about teasing apart what exactly is different spatially and in these distinct neighborhoods that promote different signaling behaviors for these groups of cells and and how this ties into the genetic variability that we see between cancer cells alone and and this is where we where where we want to be able to integrate all of these data streams again and bring some more modeling back in so at this point we have Dynamic signaling data information um information about cell lineages location history to look for things like migration and also spatial information about Neighbors which presents a lot of different Avenues to look into and a lot of different relationships that we can explore so agent-based modeling is a really powerful modeling technique that we can use to integrate all of these data streams and really focus on how cancer cells acquire their signaling States and pass them along genetically and also how these states are molded in various environments so agent-based models are especially useful in in these scenarios where individual interactions are important when we care about the spatial organization of our system and also when we have heterogeneous populations that can vary with some stochastic fluctuation and most agent-based models are set up in a way where we have a number of agents in this case our agents are cancer cells and we place them on a grid and allow them to perform some actions so as we run the simulation through time we monitor these five things on the right um namely the properties of the cancer cells where they are what they do and how they decide to do it more specifically as we're looking to track the progression of cell State and interaction of cells through time we're going to focus on this single cancer cell for example in the center that I've highlighted now in the model we were able to track properties like its location and lineage age and cell State uh and these are all things that we can compare with experimental data over time so these cells aren't stagnant they perform many actions like dividing and migrating and under the hood updating their cell state so in the agent-based model we can assign rules to these behaviors that help us mechanistically understand why certain behaviors are occurring so one example of this be that a cancer cell only divides within a certain age range or um that in the presence of a stromal cell a cancer cell updates any one of its signaling parameters by a certain amount so now based on each cell's individual history trajectory and interactions with its environment we can interpret the signaling profiles that we see and explain why the the highlighted Center cancer cell doesn't behave like one of the other curves on this plot for example and we can use this framework to determine mechanistic rules that are consistent with experimental outputs and also use this as a hypothesis generation tool to make predictions about ways to manipulate cancer cell State and test them experimentally so I know we've been talking for a long time um but just to summarize some of the questions and tools that we're using uh briefly cancer is a heterogeneous single cell uh driven signaling dis disease and we're looking at understanding heterogeneity in specific signaling Pathways that are related to oncogenic cell behaviors and we introduced some of the experimental tools that we're using to study cell signaling namely time-lapse microscopy Multiplex kinas translocation reporters and a custom image analysis pipeline that allows us to track cells and record their signaling profiles through time uh we also talked about how we couple these experiments with uh modeling both ordinary differential equation equations and agent based models to interpret the experimental data and mechanistically explore the spatial and cellto cell signaling interactions so I want to bring you back to this flowchart that I showed at the very beginning where our goals are to integrate all of these different data streams the inputs to cell signaling like genetic inheritance and Drug exposure and microenvironmental effects and also tie these to signaling outputs such as migration proliferation and resistance and again Central to all of our work is the idea of self signaling and modeling these behaviors so I want to leave you with one final goal that we that we look towards so if you'll recall we're able to explain heterogeneity in cell behaviors on this signaling landscape with our ordinary differential equation model our broader sort of longer term looking ahead goals are to be able to use this knowledge uh of cell State along with all of these inputs and outputs to Target and manipulate cells in the signaling landscape to affect effect these outputs and treat cancer more effectively so you can imagine mechanistically informed therapies to Target specific subpopulations of cells uh based on signaling State um and also manipulations to push cells to more treatable or less dangerous regions of the signaling landscape and with that I'd like to end the talk and acknowledge um all of the team members who make this work happen because this is truly a collaborative experiment uh experience with a number of different people um and with that I think we'd be happy to field any questions I have a question thank you for the wonderful talk these um these models are uh very detailed in their mechanisms and it's great to see being able to connect the the modeled mechanisms with experimental data I was curious if you could tell a little bit about um where you're seeing the most computationally difficult parts of this I can picture in some cases running the Odes might be stiff and it's difficult to get them to converge or perhaps um uh fitting parameters of agent-based models can be challenging so just you know where are you spending most of your time in the lab you know like person wise and also computational wise where is the most CPU Cycles uh spent um I can I can take that or at least Ry um would love to hear your thoughts on abms but um one huge driver of computational complexity is in fact the image processing um so that is it's definitely fat like it's it is uh I would say it is as fast as we need it to be right now because like uh my brain is only capable of taking in so much information so it doesn't really matter if it can process the data instantly but um that is that is a really huge computational um that that definitely takes a lot of of CPU power the Odes are relatively they they are stiff but they're at least so far we have been you know it takes a manageable amount of time to run them um so we when we when we generate like the signaling landscape we run around 12,000 like very combinations of those three uh species parameters and I mean that that maybe takes 15 minutes so it's there isn't a huge computational burden right now with the Odes I would say right and and sort of piggybacking off with the OD idea so right now I guess connecting our agent-based model to the OD framework is is sort of um one region where we can expect some computational complexity so right now uh like Patrick mentioned we sort of generate a a li library of signaling responses for a given stimulus or cell type things like that um we can think about running the OD model inside of inside of the agent based model sort of at every time step to understand signaling profiles through time which is which may be a direction that we head in later on down the road um but right now I think um being able to sort of look at these look at these cells through a lookup table is is serving the purpose that we have um as we're not looking at like specific kinetic variations uh as cells are dividing and things like that um any does anybody else have any other questions yeah and absolutely um if you're interested in reaching out feel free to reach out to either Patrick or myself we're always interested in in discussing all of these aspects a little bit further with with interested parties yeah I just uh realizing that was a shortcoming of the slides I just put my email in the chat so um I love talking about this stuff so yeah please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or or thoughts one more question if we have a few minutes um are looking primarily at breast cancer cell lines and I was curious if um if you anticipated these mechanisms to be um representable of cross cancers or if you have plans of looking in other other cell lines as well so there are a few ways to answer that question um we study breast cancer cells uh or we we study breast cancer um the the lucer lab has a history of studying cxcr4 cxl2 signaling and uh that is a major driver of breast cancer metastasis although it also affects other cell lines um so that that's sort of the the reason for the or that that is a reason for the focus and breast cancer amongst other obviously it's incredibly clinically important um so generally like the kise networks that we study KK and akt are responsible for oncogenic signaling in just about any cancer you're interested in so we generally expect that there are um like the signaling Network that we described would be at least relevant in other cells although the the copy out there is that since um other cell lines would have other mutations and would have other micro environmental inputs for instance uh different tumors would maybe or like tumors in different parts of the body would be stiffer or softer for instance like gasto and the brain is very soft um so we we you know we believe that like Ras is still going to activate irk in every cell but how that is how that actually plays out in the cell is going to be then affected by other things so we we would expect that this idea that there is a pre-existing cell state that can control how cells respond to different lians or different inputs we think that that's a general idea but I would hesitate to sort of extrapolate too far outside of of breast cancer if we were to get to the point of making like very specific clinical recommendations does that kind of make sense and yeah Ray feel free to add your thoughts yeah no I I agree with everything you said I think main main takeaway is that this is like uh this is a this is a platform that we're using so I think um different cell types different uh different genetic mutation things like that we can sort of plug plug and play once this once the system gets a bit more developed and say okay this is how breast cancer cells behave can we take and adapt our signaling landscape and understand behaviors in different Cancers and make clinical recommendations based on the underlying behaviors that we're seeing from this framework that this is really nice work it's gilomen and I appreciate you're presenting it to our especially computational crowd because we need need to make more and more connections to the biological colleagues I'm particularly interested about breast cancers and I'm curious uh whether of course these are well-known Pathways you've highlighted but whether you've identified any differences specifically between estrogen progesterone receptor positive breast cancer herb2 breast cancer positive and so-called triple negative of many different varieties there's a lot of heterogeneity that's routin ly identified in breast cancer studies I just wonder if those stand out in your analysis also or whether you've looked at it yet so I can say so we we've done a lot of comparisons um in Phil's first paper he used MDA mb231 cells which are triple negative he used sum159 cells which I believe have estrogen receptor although I'm a little bit fuzzy and VAR cells which are patient drive to line um we've been doing a lot of work in 231 cells and mcf7 cells mcf7 cells do Express estrogen receptor so we're starting to sort of pick apart the differences in mutational background and and sort of associated differences in in cell lines um but we haven't I guess I I would say we haven't explicitly looked at like signaling from the estrogen receptor as an experimental variable if that makes sense it's more been um we've been comparing like cell lines with different mutational backgrounds uh does that start to answer your question I'm not sure it's generally relevant yes um U different mutational backgrounds of course one of the things that's a major resource if you're not aware of there's a lot of workbed here from University of Michigan is something called CPAC this is proteogenomics of 13 different kinds of cancers including breast cancers uh here we've been working primarily on head and neck lung adno and lung sis pancreatic and um uh Reno cell carcinoma but there are others in the broad Consortium of the NCI what I was driving at was a little different um and we've had an interest going back number of years on identifying uh splice ISO forms of key uh proteins and transcripts in key Pathways and our Focus was especially with the suum 149 I think that might be a pretty common cell line and um other lines with um isopor analysis both with transcript and mass spectrometry based proteomics level and you can see important differences according to those uh finer details in the pathways and if you have any way of getting such data for your analysis I think would add some depth yeah that that has been a major um that's been a major focus is how do we integrate other streams of data um because again we sort of believe that these the molecular interactions that we're modeling are General uh pi3k is always going to activate akt but if a cell has more or less pi3k um in terms of like transcripts or maybe potentially maybe it's localized in other places in the cell um those those interactions are then going to be sort of modulated at a different scale um and that is something we need to take into account into our in our models although it opens up other sort of difficulties with actually getting the data at a single cell level um but yeah was that cptac variation is from post translational modifications of proteins you cannot predict those from genes and transcripts right World leading analyst of those kinds of changes is right there in your department Alexi Nishi in our department Alexi Nishi is um also responsible for the pathology proteomic service laboratory and he's a spectacular guy in the area of uh proteogenomics and U computational aspects of proteomics gotcha um yeah thank you thank you for the heads up um and did you say cptac was that cptac CP teac yeah CPT right gotcha I will check that out thank you very much sure thank you again I think we are at the hour so I would just like to thank our speakers and I think we can stop the recording
