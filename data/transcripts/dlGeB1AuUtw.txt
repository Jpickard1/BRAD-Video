thank you so much given for that excellent wonderful introduction some of which were you know slightly embellished but that's how most introductions go the part that I take credit for though is be awesome Haley in it you know you don't hear anything else you know I think that a Haley is super awesome and she's been instrumental in a lot of what we're gonna talk about and while I wait for some more people to come in first I want to talk about the emergency department you know this is what it looks like as any one of you been to the emergency department before yeah it it looks like that it looks like that we see patients everywhere in the waiting room in the hallways but never in the bathroom we don't do that and and that's really important because most of the decisions that we make are kind sensitive and and part of the reason I show this picture also is that we're usually faced with information overload so it's not unusual that I am taking care of you know a cardiac arrest patient and then a nurse comes in and sticks on EKG in front of me of court just pain patient because those EKGs have to be reviewed within five minutes of being obtained and so you know I'm running a cardiac arrest someone is sticking an EKG in front of me and then you know I may get a call and almost at the same time about you know transfer patients who is gonna come in or there may be another patient next door who is critically ill and and so you know we typically you know have a ton of information overload and and with every passing year there are new diagnostic tests and and and so you know there's a lot of information coming from all those different sources as well so being able to drill down knowledge and information from all those very data sources it's critically important and I think that that's where you all fit in and and I'm hoping that you know as as I talk you begin to have ideas about how you can help us be more successful in taking care of trim energy patience so I want to tell you about how we take care of traumatic brain injury patients and first of all I'm gonna say that there's a huge burden of traumatic brain injury evaluations in the emergency department but our current evaluation is inefficient and it's also overly optimistic so every year in the United States we see almost 5 million EB visits for traumatic brain injury five million and out of that five million about two and a half million actually diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and these are the the only patients who come to the emergency department from traumatic brain injury there are tons of people with traumatic brain injury who never seek medical care the majority of patients who come in with traumatic brain injury or suspect a traumatic event you get a cat scan and the cat scan is horrible it's a lot of money yes and it doesn't tell you a whole lot so what the cat scan does is it tells you if you're bleeding in the brain period sometimes you can see some science of axonal injury but the brain is made up of a whole lot of cells that are not blood cells and so if you damage you know neurons and axons and exercise you know those usually don't show up on a cat scan and although we get cat scans on 80% of this four-and-a-half or most five million patients only 10% of those cats can produce information that we can use only 10% of those catechins are positive so the majority of cat scans are actually negative and uninformative so you're gonna see these four letters G OS e the gos e is a scale we use for for measuring clinical outcomes in traumatic brain injury and it was developed in Glasgow and one is equivalent to death and eight is that you're back to your functional baseline and so you're gonna see this a whole lot and I just want to orient you in terms of you know what a gos ears and we have a number of different ways for categorizing the US II one of the usual cut-offs is four or less and for a g-ghost USD or four means that you know you are at home and you can exist by yourself at home but you can't get out of the house by yourself you know if you need to go shopping or go out of the house you're gonna need help and typically if someone after TBI is not able to go out and shop independently and do activities of getting even independently then we say they have a bad outcome that's we're hoping that you know we can get people the point where even if they need help with someone around they can at least go out and be independent so you know we did a study called a head smart study where we examine patients who came to the emergency department with traumatic brain injury and about half of the cohort had a gos e of less than eight at three months less than eight means you're not back to your for your baseline mental status and that you know you probably are still having headaches having difficulty concentration with concentration difficulty with sleep and so on and and when the patients came to the emergency department I asked the ER physician you know this person in front of you what are the chances that they are going to still have symptoms at three months how accurate do you think the ER physicians were any guesses so you know someone comes in with head injury and then we ask them on the day of injury do you think the person you're seeing now is gonna keep on having symptoms at three months not very accurate yeah 20% so we our emergency physicians were very optimistic and they pretty much thought that everybody was gonna be fine and they said only 4% of patients were not gonna be fine and part of the issue is that we currently classified traumatic brain injury as mild moderate or severe so bad tell someone who used to be able to go to work but because they are not comatose we're calling them mild but they can't go to work or they can't go to school because they're having headaches and they're having difficulty concentrating and I remember this one patient who said she was a public school of public health student at Hopkins and she said you know I'll go into the bathroom I'll shower shampoo my hair and then forget that I shampooed my hair and do it all over again I'll talk to someone on the phone and don't realize that I just talked to that person but we call those people mild which you know that's a huge disservice you know to those people so essentially my point is you know we do a really bad job of diagnosing traumatic brain injury now and when it comes to clinical trials for traumatic brain injury here's what we do so although we call we have one term traumatic brain injury there are different subtypes of traumatic brain injury you can have a contusion you can have hematoma you can have cerebral swelling you can have diffuse axonal injury there are a number of different subtypes of traumatic brain injury here's what we do when we do clinical trials we put everyone in the same basket and so you know these are you know some studies that have been done in traumatic brain injury and all of them have failed you know all these studies have been negative people come up with a new drug they test it and it shows that it doesn't work in traumatic brain injury why is that it's because we're acting like we're treating cancer can you imagine doing a clinical trial where you say you know I have a drug for cancer and so I'm gonna treat everyone the same I'll treat breast cancer and prostate cancer and lung cancer all the same that's what we're doing to traumatic brain injury and and and no one that the treatments are not working you know it's because you know we're lumping everyone in the same basket and treating them all the same so it's not about equality it's more about equity that that also in these clinical trials you know we treat everyone equally which should not be the case there are some patients who are gonna need more of the dose of a certain drug right you may have someone who has a more severe injury and so they may need 20 milligrams of a particular drug as opposed to someone else you know who has less severe injury or smaller body size you know who needs a smaller dose of that drug but we currently you know treat everyone the same we give the same doses to patients and we do not have a good way for monitoring how well patients are responding the various treatments you give them so we're essentially driving blind and typically I should've been about driving blind but that's essentially what we do that we without paying attention to you know the different subtypes of patients you know we love them all in the same basket we give them the same treatment we have no way of monitoring their treatments to titrate treatment according to the effect of individual patients and then when the child's fail you know we question why this is happening so this is my conceptual framework this is sort of how I view the world of traumatic brain injury that initially there is the primary brain injury we can't do anything about that you know primary brain injury is where you know you damaged some brain cells and sort of is the mechanical impact and the only way that can be prevented will be you know public health campaigns and you know wear helmets and wear seat belts and so on so I can't do a whole lot about primary brain injury then there are the pre injury factors that I can do a whole lot about either we know that the more educated you are the better your outcome is gonna be if you have traumatic brain injuries so stay in school keep on studying we also do know that people with premorbid psychiatric problems tend to have a harder time with recovering from traumatic brain injury and so these are you know premorbid conditions that we can't do anything about here is what I can do something about secondary brain injury so after the primary brain injury there is secondary brain injury and the secondary brain injury is caused by a number of different things one is serb or hypoxia which essentially means low oxygen levels in the brain so you know the brain this is a highly metabolic organ that uses a lot of energy and and if your oxygen levels are low in the brain you're not gonna be able to perform the functions that are necessary the next important thing is decreased cerebral perfusion which means you have no blood flow going to the brain and and these are the two these are the two main areas where you know we try to intervene some of the causes of cerebral hypoxia or decreased oxygen level in the brain are things like poor oxygenation so the traumatic brain injury patient may also have lung injury and so they're not getting enough oxygen who are ventilation which speaks more to the carbon dioxide levels that you know they're not breathing well and exchanging gas as well and if you have a higher co2 level that can cause constriction of the blood vessels and so parts of the brain will not get enough blood flow there's also low hemoglobin if you're you know trauma patients can lose a lot of blood and so the low hemoglobin can also cause you know decreased amount of oxygen in the brain and then you can also have increased metabolic rate and that sometimes can happen when you have a seizure you know some traumatic brain injury patients have seniors and some of they'll also have infections and all that stuff can increase the metabolic demand and lead to several hypoxia there is also decreased blood flow to the brain which is you know cerebral decreased herbal profusion that can happen from systemic hypotension so you know the brain injury patient has a liver liver injury as well and it's bleeding in their belly so their blood pressure is low and so they're not getting enough blood to the brain and that's causing additional brain injury on top of the primary brain eg they already had and and then this other one is also a really important increased intracranial pressure so whenever you have injury to the brain the brain usually swells and the pressure in the brain goes up and if the pressure in the brain is up you need higher blood pressure to be able to get more blood into the brain and and so essentially the equation for cervical fusion pressure is you know your systemic arterial pressure - your cranial pressure and the higher the intracranial pressure goes you know the lower your cervical fusion pressure has and so these are the areas that you know we can intervene on these are the things that we can do to prevent secondary brain injury but how do we measure secondary brain injury we have no tools there's really just no good way to measure secondary brain injury you know there's some new Diagnostics that I will talk about like that allow you to measure things like brain tissue oxygen and that allow you to measure server perfusion pressure but all of those have limitations my hypothesis is that it's all in the blood that we have lots of things that we can measure in the blood you can measure proteins you can measure metabolites we can measure RNA and and by looking at you know these analytes in blood and looking at how they change over time we will be able to better monitor secondary brain injury and so if you don't hear anything else in this lecture you know that's the one thing I want you to remember that you know my main premise is that it is in the blood that by measuring analytes in the blood and by measuring you know how those analytes change over time we can get a good sense of secondary brain injury so I'm not just making this up that we already have evidence that there are some proteins that you can measure in blood that can give you a sense of what's happening in the brain so this year we had two blood tests that were approved by the FDA for traumatic brain injury there are D F a P and ECHL one so g FAPE glial fibula acidic protein it's a structural protein found in astrocytes and essentially is released anytime you have damage to brain cells and you see HL one it's an enzyme that's found in neuronal cell bodies and again anytime you know the cells die they release this enzyme and that's what we've been measuring and so a study was done just this year called the alert TBI trial then looked at a thousand seven hundred eighty patients and I'm gonna walk you through this table and so they there were a hundred us and seven of them had a positive CT scan I told you that majority of the CT scans I usually negative so in this group 1673 patients had negative CT scan and a negative CT scandal doesn't mean they didn't have TBI it just means they were not bleeding the brain now this test is really good in that out of the 107 people who had a positive CT the test was able to pick 104 and missed three and those three that were missed you know what actually one of them you know even though they had a positive CT scan when they did an MRI the MRI was negative and the other two had tiny tiny tiny amounts of bleeding in the brain which you know didn't do anything about anyway so and you know the negative predictive value is actually also pretty good and so there's six hundred and sixty eight people are people who did not have a positive CT scan and they also had a negative test you didn't lose a blood test so these are actually CT scans that can be avoided the 668 people so first point you know that GF AP & echo1 a good blood test for identifying you know those who are gonna have a positive CT scan and then using you know data from one of the studies I've been working on called a track TBI cohort and I won't bother you with all the details but essentially track TBI it's a multicenter study that enrolls TBI patients across the country and follows them for the clinical outcome and and based on this one blood test GF ap and looking at the data we can categorize the GFF p-values into three zones there is a zone of people with super low levels and these are people who do not need a CT scan and they're not gonna need surgery so essentially you know even though they may have TBI their levels are so low that you don't even have to worry about it getting a CT scanning these people and then they are the middle zone people who need a CT scan but they're probably not gonna need surgery and so if for the military for example you know these people in both the green and the red and the yellow zones are people who do not necessarily need to be evacuated from the field because it's really unlikely they're gonna need surgery and then there are people in this red zone who are people with the highest EF ap levels and then those are people who absolutely need a CT scan and most likely I gonna need some sort of surgical intervention so you know the data is unfolding and we're not using these tests clinically yet but we're slowly building the database and the takeaway is that these blood tests are really good they for identifying those who have leads in the brain and then also be for risked ratifying people trying to figure out who is super sick versus who is not that sick so this is another study that I'm hoping to submit for publication either tonight or tomorrow where we're looking at a 900 I'm sorry yeah crudely yes yes you know because and I guess with the next slide I will show you that so the mild moderate and severe is based on the GCS so GCS is the Glasgow Coma Scale and it's socially so yeah it is related but the blood tests do a little bit better than GCS which is what the next slide is going to talk about so we we looked at 946 patients and we looked at five different proteins here okay so that proteins are GF apec HL 1 there are a couple more proteins we looked at s 100 b NS e and high sensitivity CRP so again you know what did I just do okay all right it's back okay just to get everyone oh it's gone again it's back ok all right so we for each protein you know we divided the values into quintiles and and the y-axis is remember the GOS eat and for or less is that you know you can't operate independently outside your home so these are the number of people who didn't do well essentially and as you can see for most of these proteins you know those who were in the highest quintile they did not do well at all compared to those with in the lowest quintile and and especially the first 3 this this and that you know you can really distinguish between those who did well versus those who did not do well these two didn't work out so well now how many of you are familiar with the area another receive operator keV awesome okay so GCS like I said is what we use now it's based on you know whether the patient is talking if their eyes are open and if they are moving you know the extremities so you don't have to do any tests any blood tests you don't the painting money this is based on a clinical exam and how well the clinical exam does right now the AUC is 0.6 T 3 when we added these two proteins to the AIDS to the biomarker or to the GCS the AEC went up to 0.85 3 and typically you know an AAC of 0.9 or greater is like excellent point seven point eight it's good and let on that you know it's probably not quickly useful so this is good this is good and not too many biomarkers are able to do this yes what is the goal planet so that's the gos a that's that's the scale were you know we asked people how well they're doing and see if they're able to operate functionally at home or not the scale of one to eight fitting it yes so this was measured actually six months afterwards so essentially these are people who didn't do well after six months after injury and these blood tests were obtained on the day of injury it's pretty powerful bad on the day coming I can tell you how well you're gonna do in six months so we also and this is sort of where I'm gonna need your help a whole lot is that we also look to see whether we can follow these biomarkers over time and and whether these markers can tell us how well a patient is doing and how well they are responding to treatment and so we worked with dr. Lamas lab McCollum is the chief of trauma surgery and he has some pigs that got a TBI model so he'd be essentially hit the pigs in the head give him TBI and then they monitored them over time and they decided to test a drug called valproic acid and so this is the group that we see the test drug law work acid these are the people who used to receive normal ceiling which is essentially just water and so we measured the levels of GF AP which is the protein I've been talking about over time the time scale is from 0 hours to 10 days who can tell me the difference in the two graphs well BPA versus normal ceiling any takers anyone janitor was a difference in the GAAP levels between those who got water only versus girls who got a experimental drug come on yes yes yes yes essentially that you know the the levels in the biomarkers no in this particular biomarker was a lot lower and those who got VPA compared to those who got normal saline now if I tell you that this biomarker it's measuring cell death because this biomarker it's a structural protein that sits inside in the astrocytes and it only relieves when astrocytes die so if some animals are having lower levels of this marker what does that suggest anyone less salsa dying yes yes oh yeah so these are this is actually an Astra cynic marker and yep and then the lesion size also went down so so the blood is actually showing exactly the same thing and and so we we think that you know we can actually monitor how well people are doing by look at Indian blood and telling how much brain cell death is going on we looked at a second protein called neuro fleming light chain and this is an EXO low protein and we saw the same thing that the levels of this marker were lower in people receiving the animals receiving BPA compared to those not ECB BPA and and essentially this is sort of where we're going with this line of work that that not only are we interested in measuring on the day of injury what's happening but we can follow patients over time and get a sense of if they are doing well or not right now when we do clinical trials what happens is that we have to wait till six months to be able to tell if a drug is working or not but with this you know we should be able to tell over in a shorter time period whether you know your drug is actually causing less brain cell death or not and but it's not just these proteins metabolites can tell us something as well and I just met a bolide but errant RNAs can tell us prognostic information as well and the challenge with monitoring over time is that we start having a whole lot of data and you remember the first picture I showed you about the emergency physician who is taking care of you know a ton of different patients and has this information overload it is gonna be really hard to decipher you know what to do you know with all this continuous data biomarker and and and so we need you know novel techniques to be able to make sense out of these loans you know data and especially you know to see how the different proteins change in relationship to each other remember the slide where should be five different proteins and three of them we're actually a sushi that with the outcome you know the number of different proteins that can be looked at but we have to understand you know how they are changing individually and how they're changing with respect to each other and and that sort of the challenge we have and that's something that you know we could use your help with solving so that's what Alam is doing at the next phase and so they've started a phase 2 trial with BPA and you know for my part you know I'm not as interested in BPA I am more interested in being able to monitor how well patients are responding regardless of the treatment you're receiving yeah yeah which he's actually also tested you know he's looking at some HVAC specific inhibitors as well and yeah yeah no it's it's it's awesome I want to tell you about you know some of ongoing projects you know where we're gonna have a ton of data and we know what to do it one of them is boost free trial so boost we just got funded by the NIH and boost three essentially sends four great oxygen optimization instigate TBI and so what's happening boost 3 is that we're gonna go a little bit of thousand patients and patients are gonna be randomized to either ICP monitoring only what I mean by that is they put a probe in their brain to measure the pressure remember I told you perfusion was important so they put a brain aim to measure the pressure and they direct treatment based on pressure monitoring so you're not going blind you're going based off of what you can measure and then some people are gonna get both ICT monitoring and partial brain tissue oxygen monitoring now this is what Pasha brain tissue oxygen monitoring looks like so they drill a hole through her skull and could a probe in a normal part of the brain and that probe measures the oxygen level at about a two centimeter radius and and gives you a value and usually you don't want anything less than 20 so so the treatment you know will be targeted towards getting that level higher than 20 so some patients are gonna get only ICP monitoring some patients are gonna get ICP and brain tissue oxygen monitoring and then we're gonna see which patients are gonna do better thank you yes yes which is why blood tests are gonna be better and and that's that's my whole point with that that what that probe does is they put it in normal brain tissue so you have traumatic brain injury you have one area of the brain that is like all messed up for lack of a better scientific word and and then you have the good part of your brain and the probe is gonna be placed in the good part of the brain and and the probe is gonna measure a small radius around the tip of the probe and it does so happen that you know if you've had severe traumatic brain injury there's also spasming on blood vessels and so even the good areas can still have decreased blood flow but you can't tell me that for sure you know if the normal brain areas oxygen is fine it doesn't really tell me that the injured brain area area is fine as well and this is why I think that the biomarkers are gonna do even better than this tool because with biomarkers as I've shown you already I can tell you how many brain cells are actually dying and I can sort of measure you know the global amount of brain cell death so we're in the process of submitting an application called bio boost where for patients enrolled in this funded trial you know we're gonna get lot samples and we're gonna get longitudinal sampling we do every three are every eight hours on the first two days and then twice a day for the next seven days and then continue getting samples up to six months out and and so we're gonna have a ton of data and because we have blood you know we should be able to measure all kinds of proteins and you know other analytes it is and yes we'll be doing all of that as well yeah so the boost is gonna use exception from your own consent the parent study is gonna use accept me from your own consent where you know it's it's a whole process where you do community consultations and you know you tell them yes yes so this is but this particular study is exception from your own consent yeah I would say though that for bio boost which is the biomarker portion of the study we are gonna get consent and we're gonna get consent from the legally authorized representatives so we will our current plan is that will go and it will draw the initial sample you will hold it will look for a family member if you can find a family member you know then you will be the additional sampling if we can't find a family member then we will discard a tissue sample you just want to miss that initial sample so we're gonna get it regardless and Polly knows we've done this in other studies yeah this is all severe TBI this is all severe - yeah I also give all GCS 3 to 8 so yes there can't consent and yeah there's all security di patients and and yes there's a whole process for doing exception form in constant studies matter of fact we had gone to the DoD asking for funding for bio boost they didn't fund us because they they don't fund exception from informed consents that yeah so yeah I know I okay there is another study that yeah working on what we're actively enrolling patients now it's called a hyperbaric oxygen in brain injury treatment trial where essentially we put people in a chamber with compressed oxygen as I told you early on hypoxia you know can be one of the causes of secondary brain injury and so the hypothesis here is that if you give you a ton of oxygen under pressure you know we're gonna be able to get a whole lot more oxygen through these brain cells and hopefully people can get better so people are randomized to different doses of this oxygen versus you know standard of care where you know you just get regular oxygen and we're following people to see who is gonna get better and we're looking for funds right now to actually collect blood samples in these patients as well so we can be able to test you know whether this treatment is actually causing a decrease in brain cell death based on blood samples last study that I want to talk about it's a study that Hayley is intimately familiar with and she's involved all 20 subjects that we have in this study right now and we call it Optima TBI pilot one of the things you're gonna notice is data for any clinical trial to be successful you have to have a cool day so if any of you is interested in doing clinical trials you gotta work on the mnemonics in this study what we do is we randomized more of them mouths TBI patients again I hate that word mild but these are the non comatose TBI patients we give them 6 grams of fish oil per day for one month and then 1.2 grams of fish oil per day for two additional month and for you you get randomized to either that or to placebo which is olive oil for three months and you know the pills look pretty similar I guess I problem if you break them away from Burke after taking them and you smell the fish oil we follow these people for we get blood samples when they come in and then that's two weeks at one month and at three months and you know we're gonna look to see if the levels of these biomarkers of brain injury changed over time but we have 20 patients now and we're hoping to add a few more proposed that analyzing the samples that's an exclusion yeah it's a quick link right here you know you can tell them how many times you run to the IDI and we got excited and then patients on fish oil so we could enrolled it yeah the challenge is that yeah you need you need a lot of a lot of people who've been on that let's be able to answer that question so I think yeah that would be a good question to answer down the line one of the things that we're also doing is that we're collecting red blood cells and so you know everyone has like a DHA intake right and so we're gonna get the red blood cell DHA intake and we can know exactly sort of what the baseline is and see whether those with low baseline do better you know than those who are already saturated so great question and and so we were working with some engineers to come up with a way where we can monitor the levels of these blood biomarkers in essentially a continuous fashion and then you know hopefully beam the results to like an iPhone or to a monitor but again you know these are gonna pose analytical challenges because you know the more frequently you measure things and the more values you have the greater the need for advanced analytics that would be able to give clinicians you know some sort of decision support and some sort of binary decision making and there are ton of people you know who helped to make this possible and I thank them all and I'll pause for questions seeing that GF AP was Astra static in nature and yes I understand that blood samples are easier to drop but are you seeing any of these biomarkers in CSF absolutely yeah and and for all the studies yes we are we are collecting CSF as well and a lot of severe TBI patients you know have drains in the brain so they can easier to collect see yourself in them but I'm so-called milder patients you know usually don't have any of those drains and so it limits the applicability you know in an outpatient but for sure in the severe patients and and I do think that at least the initial data suggests that the CSS values more accurate than blood we just expected yes have you um looked at all at variation in where the injury occurs within the brain and whether that affects the GF ap levels in the blood stream yes that is something that we're planning to do but haven't done yet so track TBI unbold a total of 2700 TBI patients we've analyzed samples in the first 1375 to be able to do effectively do seven analyses like that you need more n and actually questions whether we're going to be able to even do that analysis between some hundred patients because the challenge is a lot of people have a lot of different things going on right you don't just have you know one area of the brain damaged usually have three or four areas of the brain damaged so again you know this is the opportunity for for you guys to help out Kayvan has an algorithm for being able to automatically quantify lesion size and vision location and again as you know all these studies and rotations that and I the NIH and other funding agencies are requiring that for all of these major trials that are going on all of the data needs to be put in a particular warehouse and about a year or two after the end of the study everyone can have access to it so you know I see lots of your career going forward I mean these are gonna be databases that are available to you the images the blood test results and a clinical data they all gonna be available to you so just to follow up on that um the reason I was asking about that is recently found that there is a population of astrocytes in the brain that's located in two different regions that actually Express gfa P under normal circumstances it might be really interesting to try to see if maybe the reason why this biomarker shows up in some cases is because the the astrocytes like on the outside of the brain all right so they expressed GF ap in normal yeah it's a we can chat afterwards yeah but basically we found that there's a thin layer of astrocytes expressing GF ap on the outside of on the outside because they all have it in the inside but they may have it on the outside as well yeah which so maybe those with increased to that area may have even higher levels than those without injury to that areas that when you injure the brain you know the astrocytes kind of come in and it'll trait and create that protective layer that's probably what you're talking about I'd be a gold mine yeah yeah [Applause]
