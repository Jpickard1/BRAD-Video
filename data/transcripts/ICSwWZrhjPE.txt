the pizza um as you guys may have noticed your hearing past weeks the pizza has a different crust it actually makes it here rather than previous weeks they've been baking it elsewhere and then bring it over so if anyone has feedback on the crust let me know for those of you have never been here before us the tools and Technology seminar series it's a weekly seminar to discuss tools technologies methodologies either newly developed currently in development maybe previously developed but just be using novel way or an interesting way that is of use to researchers so today I'm pleased to present our speaker we've got Sarah Graham who is a grad student and biophysics and Heather Carlson's lab okay thank you so our lab is kind of broadly interested in computational computational techniques for structure based drug design and then one I'll talk to you about today is mixed solvent molecular dynamics we're kind of half split into more database bioinformatics approaches or half a lab sort of uses these molecular dynamics based approaches so I know everyone's maybe from a broad background so if you're not familiar with the ways that are typically used to screen for potential drugs they're sort of experimental or computational methods so for example you might be familiar with high-throughput screening where you have your target of interest and you'll screen thousands of compounds in a high-throughput format using some assay some of the problems with this or that there's a lot of experimental variability potentially so something that might come up as an inhibitor in one assay might not come up as an inhibitor in other assays or even within the same assay there's sometimes issues with reproduced reproducibility I'll turn me alternatively there's more structure based approaches so for example x-ray crystallography or NMR you can use to understand the structure of your protein or how small molecules might interact with your protein but again you're sort of limited in the number of structures that you can look at because of its potentially time-consuming or expensive alternatively there's been some computational methods that have been developed so for example docking if you know the structure of your your target of interest and you have either a ligand that you know interacts with your structure or ligands that you're interested in screening if they interact with your structure docking methods position the ligands within the protein and they're then scored based on how strong their interactions are so from that you can get an idea of how these interactions are actually occurring or which ligands might actually interact favorably with your protein there's also a fragment based screening approaches so rather than looking at whole ligands and how they dinner after the protein sort of the building blocks of larger ligands and I'll go through kind of one of the fragment based approaches that you might be familiar with ft map as a webserver that's developed that takes either protein DNA or RNA structures they have 16 different small molecule probes so they'll take each of these probes position them across the protein surface these are then energy minimized to identify favorable interaction sites and then they're clustered to identify sites where these probes are making interactions within a region now the reason they do clustering is there's been some initial crystallography studies where they've found that regions on the protein surface that bind multiple small molecule probes correspond to what are called hotspots so these are regions that contribute highly to the interactions between proteins and ligands so from this you can identify binding sites you asking if it can find the binding site is that justify agenda with bindings Lincoln nonspecific binding site yeah so it's it's a method of looking for binding sites if you have a specific ligand that you're trying to figure out how it interacts that would be more docking approaches that you want to use is that yes yeah so some of the strengths of FTA map it's really fast they in their papers they report that it's about an hour to do these calculations for a certain target there is some time that you're sitting in their queue potentially the it's used as a webserver it also has a diverse number of probes so they have 16 different types that they're using to identify a range of different interactions however because we're sort of the trade-off that you get and having the speed is that you're only minimally accounting for flexibility so you can use either ensembles of structures so if you have multiple structures from crystallography or NMR you can use multiple structures uploaded to their server they also have some ability for a limited inclusion of sidechain flexibility what we found in using ft map in our group Fani was a previous spread student in our group that did uploaded a bunch of structures of site of proteins that had both active and allosteric sites 2ft map and we found that ft map tended to miss some of the allosteric sites so this is presumably due to the fact that it's not always sufficiently in accounting for the flexibility as well as potentially a large number of false positives so sites that are shown to have clusters of probe molecules binding their but don't necessarily correspond to ligand binding sites so we kind of brushed over this but just to go into this again we know that oftentimes in your biochem classes you're sort of taught the lock and key model of protein binding where there's a protein and a ligand and they'll interact in sort of a conformation that's already pre arranged but this isn't necessarily true we know that proteins can change confirmations to by and ligands so this could be as simple as sidechain rearrangements where one ligand might interact with a certain conformation the side chains would be in a different orientation in the aprile structure and other ligand bound structures we also know that we can have larger motion such as loops that will change confirmations or even entire domains that'll change how they're oriented relative to each other we also know that in using some of these faster techniques you're not truly accounting for the role of water so prior to a protein in a ligand interacting the proteins engulfed in in a layer of water as well as the ligand and when the protein and the ligand come together these water molecules there have to be displaced and the protein in the ligand can interact directly or some of them can be conserved in what we call bridging interaction so these are going to be waters that mediate interactions from the protein to the ligand through an intermediate water molecule and so our labs been interested in developing what are called Co solvent like many of those techniques so these are techniques where you do molecular dynamic simulations and then rather than having water as the salt you have a mixture of small molecule probes in water so the general procedure I'll go I'll go through this in a little bit more detail but you have some mixture of small molecule probes so slightly little little pieces or building blocks of what you would see in a larger drug like molecule you would then do molecular dynamic simulations and you can look at where the probes in the water interact and the protein surface so this addresses some of the limitations that we saw with some of the initial computational techniques so we're accounting for flexibility in these simulations the molecular dynamics simulations allow for the protein to move as well as the probes in the water to sample different orientations and confirmations on the the protein surface we're also accounting for the role of water explicitly because the probes in the water have to directly compete for binding and from these simulations we can map some of the favorable interactions another drawback of this of course is that there potentially really time-consuming but yeah it becomes pretty computationally expensive to run all of these simulations and so the the method that our group has been interested in developing is or we term mix MB for mixed solvent like euler dynamics there's several groups that have been sort of developing co solvent simulation techniques simultaneously so you take care of your protein of interest you then add a layer of small molecule probes so in this case I have pyrimidine shown just surrounding the protein we then add a layer of water and then you would do simulations so what I'm showing you here are a piece of a trajectory that we did for a mix MD simulation of permitting and water in this case I'm hiding the water molecules it gets kind of tricky to see if there's sort of waters all over the place you can see that we're we're allowing flexibility for the protein you can see that there's some backbone movements obviously the side chains are moving as well but we're not showing those and then the probes in the water are able to sample different positions on the protein surface through the simulation so you can see that there are some sites where a pro molecule might come on and interact for a long time there'll be other sites where the probe molecule or the water I'll just sort of come on and off and make a little bit shorter interactions so once we've done these simulations we take all of the snapshots from the trajectory and we align them we typically use the program amber for simulation so within amber there's actually some utilities that allow you to do this with all of our snapshots we take them and we overlay them with a grid so at each point on this grid you can count up how often either a probe or a water molecule is there so this gives you a time averaged view of the occupancy across the protein surface typically we normalize the occupancy so we take whatever the occupancy is at a grid point subtract the the main occupancy over the entire grid and divide by the standard deviation so this way at each grid point we'll get an occupancy in what we call Sigma units or standard deviations away from the mean and this allows us to look at these these results in a way that's analogous to crystallographic density so you can look at them in Primal or other visualization software and contour them at different occupancy levels yep yeah so there's yes you just align everything yes you would align everything I mean it depends how you want to do it but you can align it at the origin you fix the protein and it aligns usually on the backbone carbons of the protein then you just align the whole trajectory so sort of the overall goals of our mix MD simulations first and foremost we're interested in identifying ligand binding sites so some of the previous grad students in our group have looked at the ability to identify both active and allosteric sites as well as some protein for teen interaction sites once we've identified these binding sites were interested in looking at the specific interactions occurring within the site so how can we turn the maps that were getting into prospective models that we could use to screen for new ligands for these proteins so just to give you an idea of what the results might look like here I have the structure of a bull kinase it has an active site region here that we're showing with the green ligand as well as an allosteric site that's shown with the brown ligand down there I told you that we're gonna take the occupancy over the simulations and we normalize it so what you'll see is that we can contour the density at different Sigma values so high Sigma values are going to be sites that are very very highly occupied and then as you reduce the Sigma values of the I can see that I'm going to show you'll get closer and closer to the mean occupancy and what you'll see is that you'll start to get sort of colored blobs of density so what these colored blobs correspond to is essentially grid points from the grid that we counted up where these probes were binding and they're colored according to the probe type that was binding there so for example if you have this orange density here that's going to be where a pseudo nitrile is binding the magenta is permitting or the blue is isopropyl alcohol and typically the way [Music] typically the way that we look at this is to rank the sites by maximum occupancy so the first site that appears at the highest Sigma value we would call site 1 as you start to get additional sites those will be sites 2 and 3 and what we found is that the top-ranked sites by maximal occupancy correspond to the biologically known ligand binding sites so you can see that the top sites are getting here and here are the active and allosteric sites as you go down to occupancy that's a little bit lower we'll start to pick up some additional sites so for example site 4 here this corresponds to a protein protein interactions so Abel kinase this is actually just the kinase domain there's additional domains in the different conformational state of Abel kinase what's called the closed form there's an sh2 and sh3 domain the sh2 domain binds right here and there's a I believe a tyrosine that interacts at this site so you can see from this that we are mapping sites that correspond to biologically known or Ligon ligand binding sites and again as you get closer to the mean occupancy you can see the full extent of some of these binding sites and so initially we used to do these analyses where we'd have to load everything into pi ball or some other visualization software you can also do it in chimera and manually go through the different Sigma value so we call this contouring the occupancy and that got really tedious it also kind of just gave you more of a qualitative viewpoint of the binding sites so you're interested in identifying an automated way to do this as well as giving you an analysis method that would be more quantitative so we've developed what we call mix md probe you this is a plug-in for primal so you can it's a set of Python scripts that you load into primal and then you can access it and it'll pull up some pop-up menus that do the analysis the first thing we are interested in looking at was ranking single probes so if you have simulations that you've done permitting and you want to see how these sites rank what you might imagine that is that if you were to look at the high occupancy grid points you might have something that looks like this where you'll have each grid point I'll have some associated occupancy typically what you find is that there'll be a central point that has a high occupancy which will be the most favorable probe binding site and then surrounding that you'll have sites that are a little bit less occupied from the the probe sampling different confirmations we needed a way to tell sites that were close together apart and so to automate the analysis of these clusters we've used the mean shift clustering algorithm so this is a clustering algorithm that looks at the the density density gradient of points in space so that sites that are very highly occupied become the cluster centers and then the more sparsely occupied regions correspond to the cluster edges and our sign to a specific cluster one of the good things about the the mean shift algorithm is that it has very few parameters to set so it uses a bandwidth parameter it takes a kernel density estimate of the data this bandwidth is sort of analogous to a bin width of a histogram where large bandwidth parameters or sorry large bandwidth values would give you a smaller number of clusters but they would be overall larger clusters or smaller smaller values would give you a larger number of small clusters it's also beneficial in that it allows for arbitrary shapes or sizes of clusters as well as not having to specify any predefined number of clusters or points per cluster and so what this looks like when you load it into PI ml is something like this so once we've done our simulations we get the grid points back typically we look at them in PDB format so that's just going to be XYZ coordinates with an Associated occupancy what I'm showing you here is able kinase with the the grid points from piramide and shown in this case I'm hiding the low occupancy grid points so I'm only showing the grid points that are 10% of the max of occupancy or higher in Pinal they have this plug-in menu you can select our mix and deep review plugin and it'll bring up a pop-up new asking you what you'd like to analyze the file you'd like to analyze as well as putting in the occupancy cut-offs in the bandwidth we found for our uses that two angstroms seemed to work pretty well for clustering the data then you can just select rank sites and it'll identify clusters of occupancy from your simulations and so what I have shown here are the individual grid points though they're surrounded in this white surface that corresponds to each of these clusters and then the the sphere inside the surface is the highest occupied point so our plugin makes this pop-up menu showing you the the clusters as well as the occupancy in the cluster and then you can step through this so you can either click the show labels button and it'll show you the ranking of all the clusters and you could look at it directly or you can click any of these lines and it'll highlight the different clusters both in the screen and then on here as well as showing you how the occupancy compares to other sites the second thing that we're interested in doing is identifying binding sites composed of multiple probes so typically the way we would do this is to look in Primal for regions on the protein surface that had multiple probe types overlapping at high occupancy and so to do this we have a second clustering algorithm so you can imagine that you have grid points the different colors would correspond to grid points arising from different probe occupancies we wanted a way to to identify these so in this case we've used DB scan clustering which is a density based clustering algorithm essentially it's going to look for any points that are reachable within a specified cutoff distance so you can imagine that if you have this point in this point here if you can connect the dots between these points never taking a step that's greater than this cutoff that would be the same cluster closer points that are separated by greater than this distance which they call epsilon or eps would become separate clusters you can also specify the minimum number of points so that small clusters are removed so for example these small clusters moved and this would become its its own cluster here because it's separated from other points by greater than some cutoff distance again DB scan allows for clusters of any shape or size there's no predefined number of clusters or number of points per cluster so the parameters that you have to set we've chosen the minimum number of points to be ten so that small clusters are removed for the epsilon distance we've used three angstroms so when you're looking at the probe occupancy and identifying binding sites you want to identify sites that are reachable within a few bond links so the width of a prim adine is about 2.8 X drums or a carbon-carbon bond is about one and a half Inc stones so using this value for a cut off is going to identify sites that are connected all within one to two on links we're also using center of mass occupancy for the maps that we're getting so we're only counting each of these probes over the simulation ones and so what I'm showing you here if you take all the good points that you've got from your simulation and you load them into primal we have each color would correspond to a different probe type again you would do the plug-in menu and primal it'll make our mix MD probe you plug in brings a pop up menu you can set your parameters and select the the files that you'd like to analyze again it'll assign the grid points into clusters this then brings up a menu showing the a table of all of the data for each of these clusters so you'll see that within this cluster there's an occupancy from each of the different probe types that you're running and so it calculates the maximum as well as the total occupancy by summing across the grid points it also give you for each cluster the maximum occupancy within the cluster or the total occupancy within the cluster so that you can rank them in the same way that we have before you can click on any of these and it'll highlight the clusters as well as show you the distribution of your clusters in either maximal or total occupancy you can also sort by any of these so if you're interested in say the highest map permitting sites you can sort by that and identify those clusters that way so what we were interested in using this this application that we've developed for was comparing different setup methods so our lab typically in our setup procedure we run each probe individually so this would be if you're interested in doing a single simulation of primitive you would do primitive in water and that would form a set of simulations if you wanted to do another probe we would do a different probe in water and that would be its own set of simulations other groups have done it for reasons of efficiency they'll run multiple probes at once so some of the other groups might do up to seven probes at once but it's not clear what effective this would actually have on the results that you're getting because these probes are directly competing with each other so we're interested in seeing if if both set up procedures identify the same interactions within a site as well as if we can identify by binding sites using our plugin for a range of co solvent simulation procedures so for this we selected four different targets to use for our test so I have abel kinase androgen receptor base as well as dihydrofolate reductase or dhfr we typically do ten simulations of 20 nanoseconds for each probe type and then we always do a ratio of 5% probe to 95% water so that's one of the benefits of our method that we have a fairly low concentration of organic solvent molecules so this could be reproduced experimentally so in the current procedure we have the probes listed here in our case we would run each of these individually except for the the charged probes which would be running combination so when you're doing molecular dynamics simulations is a requirement that you have a balanced number of positive and negative charges so again with the standard mix MD procedure we would run each of these probes individually for ten simulations each which would in total give you 60 simulations we wanted to see what would happen if you're running these probes in combination so initially we tried pairs of solvents so that gives us three total solvent sets each of these would be run for ten simulations each and in the in each case we're keeping the same 5 percent to 95 percent ratio of probes to water so for example here the the ratio of probes would we split in two so you'd have two and a half percent nacido nitrile and two and a half percent isopropyl alcohol the other combination that we tried was the solvents in triplets so two overall solvent sets and again ten simulations of 20 nano seconds each in total twenty simulations for this the second combination yeah you could so we were interested in in looking at both positive and negative interactions so we just used but yeah as long as you have net neutral that would be fine so do you just go in yeah for basics just water so there's the crystal structures just of base by itself is what we used there's April structures of base we used to start the simulations so the first thing they're interested in looking at was to see if both of these solvent setup methods identify the same favorable interactions within each binding site and so I'm only going to go through one set of results in the interest of time on the left I have the results from the simulations that were done of each of the probes individually for Abel and then on the right I have the combinations where the solvents were run in triplet or in triplet so three solvents in one simulation what you see here are the the larger spheres are local Maxima that were identified using our plugin and then the surrounding grid points are all of the other grid points within that cluster and they're colored according to the the occupancy of each of the solvent types and you can see that when these simulations are run individually we have mapping throughout the entire ligand binding site so I have here shown the ligands that bind within the active site of Abel however when we run the solvents in combination you can see that there are some differences in mapping for example when we run them in combination isopropyl alcohol in blue only maps this right hand side of the ligand whereas when we run isopropyl alcohol and water by itself it maps the entirety of the the ligand binding sites and what happens is essentially that these other solvents are competing preferentially for binding to this site so in some ways this is good you can capture the preferential interactions for the site however you're losing some information so isopropyl alcohol serves as a probe to identify hydrogen bonding interactions and so if you're not mapping it throughout this site you're losing some of that information that you would otherwise have if you were running these simulations of each of the solvents individually the next thing we wanted to see is if our plugin could identify binding sites for a range of these solvent setup procedures we've also moved so I guess I'll go back to here we've also moved to ranking by total occupancy within a region so what we found is that in situations of combined solvents where the solvents would be competing with one another the maximum sing the value that you would get for a site would be potentially lower because they're they're competing for binding to the same site so by summing the occupancy is within this region we're accounting for that and identifying the sites with the the total highest occupancy so what I'm going to go through are the systems that we did the the solvent procedures on and how we've identified the ligand binding sites so what I have shown here is the structure of able the the surfaces are the clusters that are identified with mix MD probe view I'm in each case I'm only showing the top 10 sites I have the total occupancy within the site you can see the distribution here and then the numbers for these these sites the total occupancy within each site is shown so you can see that for the solo simulations we identify the active site as the site with the total highest occupancy the next highest ranked site corresponds to the allosteric site and then you can see that all of the other sites have a smaller total occupancy so directly from these simulations you can see which which clusters on your your protein surface correspond to the the binding sites so we did the same thing for each of the solvent mixtures so combination a is the solvents run in pairs you can see again that we identify the actin the allosteric site is the top-ranked sites what we find with the solvent combinations is that you get a little bit less extensive mapping so you can see that compared to here you're mapping the entire ligand binding surface when we move to move to solvent combinations the mappings a little bit less expensive one thing we do find here is that the active site gets broken up into two groups this is because these these two clusters are more than three angstroms apart but again we're still identifying the the act of the allosteric site as the top-ranked sites and again for the the third combination we identify these sites as the sites with the total highest occupancy so I've done this for each of the systems that we tested again beta secret ace in this case only has one known binding site it's sort of a cleft across the middle of the protein you can see that in each of the solvent mixtures we identify the known active site is the highest ranked site in the solvent combinations we have a little bit less extensive mapping so you can see here that the region that we're mapping is smaller but this actually corresponds to the high affinity region of beta secret aces active sites so we know that there's there's ligands that overlap almost exactly with the density that we have there and those are known to actually inhibit base even an animal or human trials so again we're finding regions of the protein surface that are biologically relevant and combined ligands again dhfr it has again one main binding site and we've mapped this as the highest ranked site in every case beta secret ace and dhfr were April structures able trying to member abil an androgen receptor may have been ligand bound structures we take out the ligands before we do the simulations yeah so I know dhfr and bass for sure were able structures and agend receptor and Abel were started from structures that had no allosteric ligands found those initially came from a project we were looking at mapping allosteric sites and then we just sort of extended the analysis with this plugin but we have found I've done 10 15 different systems starting from April structures and we find in every case we can map the recover the ligand binding sites all right I guess identify yeah so the criteria we usually use comes from crystallography studies where they have hotspots of ligands correspond to sites in the protein surface that buying multiple probe molecules so we based that on the occupancy of the probes over the simulation and the sites with the highest occupancy would correspond to ligand binding sites yes either pocket so what is distance between the pretty typical fine side edge we'll be combining science all the people here so it makes sense mm-hm are you essentially asking for like the percentage of the total ligand binding site what percentage of that is kind of mapped by our probes is that kind of what you're yes I guess the numbers we focused on here would be the the total occupancy within a region I guess as far as quantifying that we're showing the entire extent of the ligand binding site so it depends I guess better is a hard word because it depends what you want to get out of it what is the coordinate of oyster residues which one I should choose I guess the I mean as far as residues in the way - that you might it it's going to be definitely system dependent so if you're you might go a couple angstroms outside of these hotspots and you could look at those residues for instance it it just really depends on the goals of your your project this was the distance between the predict you sine and cosine families the number of residues that are actually in the compiling Siam what how many you are missing I don't I don't have those numbers in here from looking at the results we can see that it almost exactly overlaps with the interactions that we know are occurring better happening I guess numbers in this in this presentation but if you need a number maybe one thing would be say for this system you align all the structures for which you have like and boundary take center of mass all those ligands and then you already anything mentioned you have center of mass or one of the [Music] clusters yeah no I think this point was that how do you compare that with the known array of like mm-hm yeah there's there's been some studies by other groups where they've looked at kind of more of the degree of overlap of specific functional groups and they've shown that these cassavetes simulations reproduce those well even if you say okay the center of masses were two angstroms away but already all the crystal structures have a large degree of yeah yes I guess antigen receptor was one of the the systems that was a little bit tricky in some of the common combinations of solvents so what we find is that across all three solvent mixtures the active site which is in the center here this is the portion of androgen receptor that binds hormones it was the the highest the site with the highest total occupancy androgen receptor also has two non allosteric sites where ligands can bind and enact as inhibitors what we find is that for the the simulations of the probes done individually these are the next two highest ranked sites as well as for the the combinations of the pairs of solvents however when we run the the solvents in trip booked our in in triplets we find that some of the other easily dissolve ated sites in the protein surface actually end up being ranked equivalently to the known allosteric sites so for example the site this is 30 here that's a crystal packing interface so that's a site that's known to be easily be solvated but isn't necessarily a site that would truly bind a ligand and and cause a change in the proteins activity and what we believe this is due to is in general this is a lower overall number of simulations so you're doing 20 simulations compared to 50 or 60 for the solo simulations so you're having a lesser degree of sampling there so potentially when you're running these solvents in combination you could use either some sort of enhanced sampling method or longer simulations to to account for that yeah so in summary from our automated tool we found that we can successfully identify binding sites and then as far as the different set up procedures again it goes back to what you're interested in getting out so if you are interested in identifying the binding sites we find that any of the solvent mixtures give similar results if you're interested in identifying all of the potential local interactions the the combined solvents tend to give a little bit poorer predictions than if you're running each solvent individually because you don't have that competition between solvents and then the last thing I'm going to talk about is once we've done these simulations we're interested in using them in a prospective way so can we actually screen for potential new inhibitors so we're interested in making what are called firm core models so I don't know if everyone's familiar with this but essentially it would be if you have some ligand binding site it'll be a map of the interaction that are occurring within the binding site so these are typically representative spheres so you just need a center and a radius for each of your pharmacal four features which are the the things that are making up your model you can then screen for ligands that would fit this so for example if you have hydrophobic interactions in some site or aromatic or hydrogen bonding interactions you can screen to see how well differently again satisfy your your pharmacal or model so again to generate these these models from our data and we take our simulations where we've allowed the probe in the water to sample for binding to the protein surface we count up at each grid point how often each of the probes are there so we would repeat this process for each individual probe that we've done the simulation on this gives you an occupancy value at each of these grid points and typically what we do is to get rid of the the low occupancy grid points um so we're looking at the the high occupancy regions and this will give you an occupancy for each of these points once we have these these clusters we want to identify and turn them into pharmacal for features so in this case I've again used the DB scan clustering algorithm in this case we're using a smaller cut-offs we're identifying grid points that are directly connected to represent our farm core features we take the highest occupancy point as the centre and then to calculate the radius we take the rmsd of each of these points to the center and that becomes the the farm core radius so it's represented as some sphere with the the center and radius given from our data so we've done this from core feature generation procedure for each of the probes in some cases you'll have interactions that are made by different probe types that are occurring within the same regions so in cases where these are overlapping we want to identify or consolidate the features into a single feature that represents the different interactions that are taking place so you can imagine if you have a site on the protein surface that is making hydrophobic interactions from different probes or aromatic interactions that are mapped by different probes we test to see if these are within a specific cutoff distance so in this case we're looking to see if the centers are less than 2 laughing strim so this would be less than the width of a permitting in that case we say that they should be represented by a joint feature we calculate the average of all these points that becomes the center and then again the rmsd is the or the radius is the rmsd of all these points to this center and that gives you a joint feature encompassing the two different interaction types in other cases you might have for example hydrophobic and in aromatic interactions that are slightly overlapping but would be better represented as different from core features so we've we've used basically anything that would have greater than this 2.5 angstrom cutoff so if the center's were separated by 3 angstroms we would say that those would be better represented by different features so as a test system we use the simulations that we had done of able so again at high Sigma values we identify the active site the allosteric site is the top-ranked sites in this case we're focusing on the the active site region and if we take the sort of the moderate occupancy that shows us the full extent of interactions that are occurring and so what we do is we take the site we're interested in we're gonna take each of the grid points within that site for all of the different interaction types so for example per imitating or acid or nitrile will show us the aromatic and hydrophobic interactions or from isopropyl alcohol we would get hydrogen bonding interactions we use our set of scripts to turn these into pharma for features or a pharmacal for model which is converted into form that could be used for the program mo which is a drug design software so we used again from four models from our mix MD simulations to do screening of our with our firm core models we took known actives from the protein databank so Abel kinase has multiple conformational States that can have in the case in this case our simulations were started from the DFG out conformation so we looked for crystal structures of ligands in the PDB that had or that bound to that conformation that gave us 13 unique ligands for the the set of inactives we use the e Abel kinase decoy set so dud is a directory of useful decoys it's a a set of decoy compounds that could be used in virtual screening that gave us about 10,000 compounds that we had for in actives in total the so the farmer model I had here has 13 possible features and so what we do in mo is you can adjust the stringency of your model so either allowing partial matches of these features so matching 10-11-12 of the features out of 13 or you can use a multiplier that increases the radii of your formal features so we tested initially tested 10 to 13 of the features so matching any any of the 10 to 13 and we found that that was too specific we didn't get any hints so what that means is that it's essentially none of the ligands could satisfy all of the features at once so reducing this to 6 to 9 features we found that we did get a number of compounds that satisfied our firm core model so what I'm showing you here the percent of active compounds that fit the pharma core model compared to the percent of inactive companies and then they're colored according to the number of features that they hit or the the the multiplier that we had to use to for that model so you can see that some of the very stringent models so using for example 1x rmsd for the radii in matching nine of the features we do have good specificity we are picking up primarily active compounds relative to inactive compounds but because it's so stringent you're picking up few compounds overall as you reduce the stringency of your model you start to pick up more active compounds and then once you get to two matching fewer the pharma core features with larger multipliers through radii that becomes a little bit too unstring Junt and that you hit a large number of compounds huh yeah yeah 10 positive in one setting your correctly predict all the 10 positive you also predict 100 negative set mm-hmm then 90% of your prediction is wrong but you will have our Z on the upper level yeah so I guess this is just the the typical way that they show them in I guess for state usually people either use Matthew's correlation coefficient or use precision to be when we don't who not perform well in embarrass dataset mm-hmm yeah that would be definitely something if we were interested in doing a more in-depth analysis then we could use some of those it's I guess that's one of the hard parts when you're doing when you're screening for sets of compounds as you know that very few of them are actually going to hit I guess this is it's that's kind of part of what happens when you're doing foreign core models is that you're going to have fairly low hit rates not all the compounds are going to work yes I haven't I haven't looked at those groups I don't know what they look like but I guess this is these are the graphs I have for this data but that so essentially so we we do have we are our models are predicting the active compounds do satisfy the model a greater proportion of those relative to the inactive compounds but this could potentially be improved so we could look at taking our pharmacal for models in our screening we've matched any of the pharma core features and that would be considered a hit because we were kind of looking at the most fair test of our method if you had domain knowledge for example if you knew that specific interactions were characteristics of inhibitors you could preferentially select those from core features or as well as possibly ranking them by occupancy for example you might use high occupancy features and make those required or low occupancy features and have those optional which might help to bias your your compounds towards things that would be inhibitors could also potentially integrate some of the shape information from these maps so typically we represent these as generic spheres but incorporating some more complex shape information might help you to to get some greater specificity from this so that was what I had we have kind of a fairly small group now in the Carlson lab but we've had several previous students that have worked on this project doing the simulations for the mix empty probl calculations I had a farm' D student in a rotation student that did some of the simulations and then we've been funded by several different groups thank you become finding some predictions oh yeah so within a binding site mapping out the interaction so we're sort of just now starting to look for virtual screening so so actually MD is not both widely used method for D combining some predictions so there are three other ways geometry based method such as concavity template based networks such as cofactor or Feinstein and machine learning based methods such as coach so have you compared mix NT with other methods not based on simulation as us the performance we haven't yet that's I guess that might be potentially one of his projects in the future but yeah we have we primarily focused so it is kind of the thinking in our lab is that some of these sites for example allosteric sites might not be accessible in April crystal structure so allowing the flexibility that you get in the molecular dynamic simulations is really important if you assume a rigid part it but like template based method if you can fire another template that has a lot stearic but be combining arrow step side because still potentially heated also our machine learning based methods they might also have their own way to go around this this problem so I understand is very decent research but if there's no comparison some if other popular method in the field is yeah so we've we've compared to ft map but we haven't done some of the other binding site prediction methods yet if I may inject here ok now I'm going to put my bias on this which is primarily I spent my career in pharmaceutical industry the power behind this is you're going out and taking pros ok specific types of chemicals and you're seeing where the hot spots for these millimolar type interactions so when you see an interaction this way where it does light up a hot spot remember millions of where compounds are hitting that not nano molar compounds so mapping entire sites and all that stuff for me as somebody interested in small molecule discovery is actually not very useful what I want to do is find out where is that hot spot that I can focus in that really likes even really lousy compounds millimolar type of finding so I can take the small molecule expertise focus there was something that is usually small generally not terribly lipophilic and that kind of thing so i can apply those tools for really small systems that target that area there really was highlighted using actually lousy types of compounds from biting so that's where in my opinion this really has the power clean but you something that the establishing a field there isn't any actual if you're measuring template based things and other stuff like that that's different you're trying to find some big spot of some sort of gel all shade that kind of maybe sort of fits our here is highlighting where is the hot spot where is the sweet spot to go after an attack and a drug discovery process but as opposed to finding out this great big huge long open cleft that you can find by inspection if you have crystal structure okay it's really easy to do but you need to find you you want to find the smaller areas not the great big ones because most of these things when you register go get four five peptides on the either side of the actives or the business district of this thing sliding in that's where you can get your specificity and all these other things like this but things of that size aren't any useful except in terms of sake tools or something like that something to cut in an assay or something along those lines this is coming it much more from a drug discovery small molecule point of view hence where's the hot spot what kind of interactions you see at that hot spot that I can then take and find and go to a database and see what's going on on a point it's nuts that does let the question the need based methods yeah but is that facing oranges mm-hm it's apples and oranges you're finding a cleft I mean it's obviously you can see here when you compare the right places but you know comparing a template 2d based method etc or something like this I don't see the point is still Apple storage is by by but we agree to disagree
