um for the introduction and thank you for the invitation to speak today uh really excited to share with you a new story that we've been working on over the last few years and uh get your thoughts um and about you know how it might be applied and and potential ways to use systematic approaches to connect variance defunction for coronary disease so over the last uh 15 or so years human genetic Studies have been highly productive and we now have uh hundreds of thousands of associations between particular genetic Loi and common diseases and complex traits so for example for coronary artery disease there are over 300 Goos signals um Each of which point to some region of the genome that influences disease R risk in people um and these provide a great opportunity for learning about mechanisms of disease uh if we can connect each of these variants to the gene cell types programs that they regulate in order to influence disease risk um just some of the examples in the context of coronary artery disease are shown here um where for example uh Karan muru and Dan Raider and colleagues dissected the function of a particular non-quoting variant and found that it you know acts in a heasy specific enhancer to regulate a gene called sort one which they discovered plays an important role in cholesterol metabolism um there are many you know other individual cases not many there are a handful of other individual cases where as a community folks have been able to wrestle particular variants to the ground and figure out exactly what they do um but this is often a long and challenging process uh each of these stories has taken maybe five or 10 years to fully prosecute and figure out the gene cell type variant and that program and we now have with this increasing rate of genetic Discovery um many thousands of additional go signals to solve um and so we've been thinking about are there can we design strategies to uh dramatically accelerate this process of course it is very challenging um at each of these layers there are many possibilities and the networks are complex so for any given gwash signal for example there might be 50 or or sometimes more variants in linkage dis equilibrium with one another um we know that one of those is associated with disease but we don't know which one or ones are causal um most of the variants are non-coding so they can regulate genes over long distances that me that each Locust might have 10 or even 50 canidate genes um most of these complex traits involve contributions from multiple cell types um so for coronary disease for example they're important contributions from the liver andyes that control cholesterol metabolism but also from vascular cells in the heart um including endothal cells and Vascular muscle cells and we don't know for any given Locus which of those cell types it acts in and then we also don't know in each of those cell types what are the possible programs that cell could uh could execute um what are the different things that a given cell can do and uh and how do particular genes control each of those programs cell type specific manner so this is just for one Locus um and we now have you know hundreds of lowai for any given disease so one of the tricks that we thought we could uh try um and and and one particular hypothesis in the field that's been observed in the context of other diseases is that if we look across different uh gasoi for a given trait that perhaps there will be certain points of convergence in particular there you know we imagine that there are many variants out of these 300 for coronary disease that act in pyes and another subset act in Neal cells and another subset AC to vessel cells and that perhaps those variants in each of those cell types will converge to regulate certain programs within that cell type so if we were to be able to Define each of these layers systematically uh we might be able to then take advantage of the fact that we have hundreds of associations and use that statistical signal of convergent on particular programs to be able to navigate this complex maze um so this is uh uh the talk I'm going to share today is about trying to um execute on that strategy uh could we systematically build a map of human gene regulation in a particular cell type to link variance to genes could we systematically build a catalog of Gene programs or cellular programs to be able to link genes to the the the cell Pathways control and then could we trace this path from variant to Gene to program from each of the different gasoi and look for convergence or enrichment in particular programs and that gives us a clue as to the causal genes in each Locus and the variant and cell types that are are uh that are relevant so this is a project that has been a a wonderful collaboration with Raj Gupta who's an assistant professor at har medical school in the BR Women's Hospital um who's a cardiologist and an expert in the role of endothelial cells in coronary disease um his lab has previously uh studied some individual variants for coronary disease for example linking a non-quoting variant that regulates a gene called endin one um and and uh and showed an important role for one of the genes out of these 300 different G signals for coronary disease um and this is a project that's been led by Gavin schnitzler a a senior research scientist um in my and Rogers Labs at the broad and by Helen Kang who's a computational associate here in at Stanford so um we wanted to focus on the role of endothelial cells uh which again are one of the key cell types in the blood vessel um play important initiating role in aerosis there are um 200 non-lipid g signals for coronary disease that I'm going to focus on today so the other about 100 signals are associated with um uh LDL cholesterol or triglycerides or um lipoprotein a and so are assumed to act in the liver um and you know through direct roles in hepatocytes for example so the question we want to answer is out of the these 200 non- lipid G signals which are the various genes and programs that act um to influence chroner disease risk okay so let's take the first step of this variant to Gene to program uh framework and see if we can systematically link non-coding variants to their target genes um I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this since this has been a big focus of our previous work um essentially we've been uh for for maybe six or seven years now we've been thinking about this problem of could we build a comprehensive map of the non-coding genome such that we could link any given non-coding variant the genes that it controls in a cell type specific manner um we think that a large large fraction of these non-quoting variants are going to affect elements called enhancers uh which activate nearby genes can act over long distances um and it and when we started thinking about this problem um six or seven years ago it wasn't clear uh how we could possibly build this you know genomewide map um we did know that uh there were a few possible mechanisms by which enhancers might act and find the target genes in any given cell type for example we knew that um enhancers and promoters were thought to act through 3D contact with one another um and so there was a a hypothesis that perhaps 3D Loops um would bring enhancers and promoters together and that um if you saw a loop in a high SE map for example that would indicate that the enhancer is regulating the gene um there is also um proposals in the field that uh enhancers and promoters might have specific might bind specific transcription factors and that provides specificity in a sort of lock and key like manner so maybe this promoter can only be activated by enhancers with a certain type of transcription Factor so that was had been observed in a few cases but it wasn't clear if either of these were a general principle that we could apply to let's say build predictive models of enhancer Gene regulation um there's also a lot of work to generate many thousands of biochemical measurements of the genome across different cell types to measure for example 3D contact frequencies using high C or to measure chromatin State using DNA and you know various chipseek Cays but it wasn't clear which of these would predict um enhancer Gene regulation uh so when we when we started thinking about this problem we you know we we thought that one of the key missing components was a good gold standard data set uh to actually tell us what enhancers are doing in the genome um only a few individual enhancers had ever been deleted uh you know prior to the crisper era um and so it was difficult to derive general rules models so over the last uh few years we've been focusing uh in part of lab on developing High through tools to perturb thousands of enhancers in directly in the genome and measure their effects on gene expression and thereby uh see if we could learn some of the rules that connect enhancers to their target genes and the particular version of this that we like to use is a crab fused to cattle Dead cast 9 or crisper interference um originally developed by Stanley CH and Jonathan Weissman um and we uh do various experiments where we deliver crisper uh eye to candidate uh enhancers that is DNA Peaks or taxi Peaks um all around a gene and then measure the effects on gene expression using highly sensitive single casses like AR flish or more recently the Taps um and in one of our uh early studies we oh sorry about this the the mouse is very sensitive okay um in one of our early studies we systematically applied these types of approaches to perturb about 4,000 pairs of a DNA's Peak where we've landed crisper ey in it and very precisely measured the expression of some nearby Gene so there are about 4,000 pairs of element Gene uh elements and nearby genes um and we can start to see that in fact these networks are complex as they had been previously seen to be in individual examples so here is an enhancer that regulates multiple neite genes here are some enhancers that skip over several genes to regulate another one located two megabases away um it looked very complicated and it wasn't clear whether there would be uh some simple logic so then with this big gold standard crisper data set we could go in and say how well do exist models do at predicting enhancer Gene connections and could um and the simplest you know approach that people use all the time is to connect a DNA Peak to the closest Gene turns out that that got it right only about a third of the time in this crisper data set um we next looked at some of the other mechanisms that had been proposed like uh connecting enhancer to genes using Loops in high SE or Loops in chipet assays um those didn't appear to work very well um we looked at whether enhancers and promoters might have intrinsic specificity for one another um and in a paper that we published earlier this year we um which is sort of the the culmination of that line of Investigation we found that essentially most enhancers can activate most promoters so it doesn't seem like there's some uh intrinsic sequence specificity that could explain most of this crisper data um and uh the perfect predictor of course would be up here at the top um where you could find all of the crisper positives um with 100% Precision we we've also looked at various predictive models um and uh o over the over the last few years um at the time we published this study uh the best previous models from encode and Roat projects for example involved correlating enhancer activity with either gene expression or chromis in state at the promoter and it turned out that those like unsupervised correlation based approaches performed really poorly at identifying the regulatory pairs in the crisper data set so given that the existing models didn't seem to work so well we went back to the drawing board and decided we could come up with a better model um to represent what we're seeing in the crisper data sets and um we ended up uh trying a very simple approach where we thought about mechanistically what how we thought enhancers work which is that they're moving around in 3D space and that they activate enhancer activates promoter when they bump into each other so in that model um one of the key parameters you'd want to know about an enhancer promoter is how frequently they contact one another their 3D contact frequency we also knew that different enhancers had different int sequence intrinsic strengths so when you clone them into an MP area start gas a for example um enhancer activity can vary over multiple orders of magnitude so we thought that in in the simplest world the expression of a gene and its and the impact of an enhancer on that gen's expression should be proportional to the activity of that enhancer multiplied by its 3D contact with the promoter and so we wrote down this very simple formula that we call the activity by contact model or ABC score where you calculate activity by contact of a given enhancer you normalize that by the sum of uh the activity by contact values of other nearby enhancers it's basically saying that the enhancers around a gene act additively and independently to affect gene expression and we estimated each of these values um you know to the best of our ability based on uh High SE data where we just look up the the intensity of the pixel and the high Matrix to estimate 3D contact between enhancer promoter um we count reads in DNA and k27 SLE chipseek experiments to estimate enhanced re activity we multiply those together in this formula and it turned out that this very simple ABC approach did quite well at predicting the results of the crisper experiments uh so you can see that um for example compared to the closest Gene which again gets it right about a third of a time this ABC score is is doing a a reasonably good job at now picking out the cases where enhancer indeed has the regulatory effect on a promoter when you perturb it with crisper so um I won't go much further into this and in terms of how ABC Works um but one of the nice things about this model is that um because it's pretty simple you can and and it requires relatively little input data um we can compute it genomewide in different cell types just by collecting the right data sets so uh what we've s shown is that for example if you collect these uh three data sets or actually a subset of them which I'll get into in a moment you can compute um enhancer Gene regulation and actually start to build these genomewide enhancer promoter maps and then take gwas variants and simply look up uh you know do they overlap predicted enhancer and if so which Gene uh does ABC predict them to regulate um in one of our uh previously published studies we took a we sort of benchmarked this approach by looking at variants for inflammatory bowel disease which had been very nicely fine mapped by hen hang and Mark Dy um and so we worked with them to take uh jwas variants or IBD uh to build ABC enhancer Maps across many different cell types and to um ask questions like does ABC in enich for variant in known cell types um in this plot for example we're looking at the enrichment of fine mapped IBD gwas variant uh in ABC enhancers relative to a random common variant in the genome and what you can see is that for example IBD variants are over 20 fold enriched in the top cell types which correspond to myoid cells that are known to be important for inflammatory valow disease if you in in if you compute the same enrichment looking at let's say other DNA's Peaks or other accessible regions that the ABC model doesn't think are important or doesn't think regulate any Gene you can see much lower levels of enrichment um suggesting that you know the ABC model is doing a good job at selecting functional elements um we've also benchmarked the ability to use ABC to identify uh genes in GW Loi and the small subset of cases where we have independent evidence that tells us which Gene is the correct one so for example for inflammatory bowel disease there are 37 J signals where um there's a there's exactly one known Gene within a megabase that's known through Mouse models or or rare uh human coding variants that provide independent evidence about which Gene is the right one um and what we can see is that ABC is doing a pretty good job at identifying those genes with high Precision um it has lower recall than uh simply assigning a GS signal to the closest Gene but um we think that's because ABC is essentially trying to solve a harder problem um in that it's trying to uh uh identify not only the target Gene but also the cell type and in this particular analysis we only have about half of the cell types that are are known to be important for IBD so overall we think that um this method provides a pretty good way to link non-coding VAR to candidate Target genes and cell types um as compared to eql approaches the advantage is that we can more easily apply it across many different cell types um uh minimally at this point we we we'd like DNA seek um in a given cell type in order to make the prediction um and we actually use cell type uh an average high SE map across different cell types which performs pretty well um and so practically uh you know in some of our recent work we've been working with the encode Consortium to build abcu maps in 350 different cell types in which uh Stam lab has collected DNA seek um and and provides us a way to link enhan the gene systematically uh W without having to go in and collect hundreds of rnek data sets per per cell type in order to compute each eils for example um so uh so just to that's all I'm going to say about ABC at this point um there are a few papers um we pointed out throughout the section for more about that but for the purpos of today's talk what we did in order to link variance to genes uh in endothelial cells is we used this ABC model um as I just described um we're going we we're we're looking at an endothelial cell model in vitro which are Tas immortalized human aortic endothelial cells that we stimulate in various ways with atherogenic stimulite and we collected aack seek and k27 settle chipseek in each of those different conditions uh use the average high map um across cell types so we're we're not collecting High SE in this specific cell type we're using um uh High SE data from from other human cell types which capture the main featur of of 3D contact frequencies we plug that into the ABC model and we get genom wide enhancer maps in in these in this particular endal cell line um we can confirm that uh this cell line seems to be a reasonable model for studying variance for coronary Disease by Computing uh heritability enrichment in ABC enhancers and so we see that ABC enhancers in this celline are about 12-fold enriched per Corner disease heritability okay so that's the first step building a gene regulation map to link variance to genes and anial cells um going to talk about the next step where we wanted to build a catalog of Gene programs and this is one where uh that was a bit trickier ideally we we want to be able to answer in a general way um which genes regulate which cellular processes in a given cell type and if we had that MTH we could take a given gas Locus and for each gene we could say okay well it turns out Gene a regulates you know I don't know cholesterol metabolism and this particular transcription Factor program um Gene C regulates cell division or AC in cyto skeleton um and start to use that to be able to systematically trace this path from apparent to Gene program The Challenge is how could we enumerate all cellular programs in an unbiased way and how how do we identify the gene Regulators for each of these programs so when we were starting to think about this project um our colleagues at the Bro Institute in the regab lab had just developed approach called perturbs um which involves delivering crisper guides into cells and then using single cell AR seek to read out the effect on the whole transcrip and we thought in theory this could be a good way to build a map of Gene program because uh one it's has a high content readout so you get to see what happens when you perturb a gene um to uh the expression of all other genes in the genome from which you can extract information about uh what the cell is doing um it was also uh in theory high throughput and that you could perturb many hundreds of of genes and um you know at at the time when we were thinking about it seemed feasible to do a few thousand genes um and uh it would allow us to directly link potentially every Gene in in every gwas Locus to the downstream programs they control so we designed an experiment where we took the 300 coronary disease jwa signals we designed crisper ey guides targeting the promoter of all genes within 500 kilobases of the lead variant in total that was about uh 1 1600 genes and then we added another 600 genes as controls um we infect this uh immortalized endothelial cell line with guide rnas so that each cell has uh approximately one guide collected a lot of single cell AR seek data in this um uh in this analysis I'll share with you today we're looking at a total of 37,000 guide arnes each uh and and um 214,000 single cells each gene that we targeted we're seeing um that Gene knocked down in about 90 cells then we take this big high dimensional data set and uh we summarize uh and sort of project it into a lower dimensional space in order to Define gene programs so we take this 20,000 Gene by 200,000 cell Matrix apply non- negative Matrix factorization to um find groups of genes that co-vary in response to perturbations um we then annotate those components or programs that are extracted from non- negative Matrix factorization uh and use that to build a catalog of Gene programs and Regulators so I'm going to show you an example of what this looks like um here's an example where we we targeted a gene called hmgcr or HMG coate reductase which is known to play a really important role in cholesterol metabolism it's also the target of Statin um so if we look in the in this case there are 159 single cells that carry guides targeting hmgcr and if you uh and it looks like we have about 60% knockdown of hmgcr itself which indicates that crisper ey is working properly um we're comparing that to about 6,000 cells carrying native control guides um if we then apply this nmf approach and look uh at each of the components from nmf and say does hmgcr knockdown uh significantly regulate any of these 50 different components we find that it actually does regulate uh six of them and if we zoom in on those each of those and start annotating them we can you know take for example this one program 19 arbitrary number um and look at for example the reg other genes whose perturbation regulates this program um which includes not only hmgcr but also other genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway so this is this essentially says that when you knock down any of these genes the expression of this program goes up um and if we look at the the the downstream genes or co-regulated genes in the program we we see that they're strongly enriched for being involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and their promoters are enriched for U motifs for a transcription Factor called nfy which is a factor that's known to control the expression of a bunch of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes so essentially we can take this program and and uh assign it a label in this case we'll call it cholesterol biosynthesis and uh call this a particular gene expression program that we've been able to learn uh denovo from the um uh from the perturb SE data and the effect of hmgcr on the expression of this program is consistent with a known uh feedback loop where hmgcr uh regulates the expression of of of cholesterol biosynthesis genes so essentially this is an approach where um we're summarizing uh we're we're using this high content gene expression data from hersek to learn um different things that the cell is doing and uh identify cases where genes are are controlling those different programs um this slide is an overview of those 50 different programs that we identified and annotated um Beyond cholesterol metabolism there are many different gene expression programs that correspond to different housekeeping processes including um for example programs in involved an oxidative phosphorilation or uh in different phases of the cell cycle or in um er translation or the cytoskeleton but we also found many programs that appear to represent interesting endothelial cell functions so there's a program uh that involves many genes involved in wound healing in angiogenesis in particular the uh the tip cell that at the at the front of the growing um blood vessel there's also so a a a cell state or or program that appears to include many genes involved in the stock cell phenotype which is like the cell uh the cells uh behind the tip cell in in angiogenesis so um these are again endothelial cells in a dish um you know in an unnatural condition you know they're not interacting with vascular smooth muscle cells and they're not experiencing blood flow like they normally would in a tissue but if you knock down the right Gene you can trigger all sorts of interesting transcriptional responses that seem to reflect known important functions of endothelial cells so Al together now we have this catalog of Gene programs and endothelial cells and specific genes that regulate them so now we can go back to our gwas data and start to combine this map of uh enhancer Gene connections and and Gene to program connections and trace the path from variant to Gene program in particular loai so here's an example of a a coronary disease Locus that where we didn't know the causal Gene um out of the Le out of the the strongest signals in the region there's one particular variant that overlaps uh an endothelial cell specific attack seek Peak um ABC thinks that this enhancer might regulate two nearby genes which is actually quite common um enhancers Even in our crisper experiments often regulate multiple genes and so this layer of enhancer to Gene mapping usually doesn't give you the the right answer by itself so now we can combine it with the gene de program information where we've knocked down each of these genes in perur and we can say okay well what do each of them do to the transcripton and it turns out out of these genes there's only one in the locus that um has an effect when you perturb it in crisper ey in this cell line uh it's this Gene here called td1 um whose perturbation significantly affects the expression of six different gene expression programs uh and when we look at the annotations for those programs they actually look really interesting with respect to aerosis um there includes Gene programs involved in flow response in angiogenesis in focal adhesions many of are which are processes that um have been associated with atherosclerosis in the past but of course this could just be by chance um it turns out that in almost every gwas Locus there is one or more genes that when you knock them down have some function and so what we'd really like to know is do other genes also affect these same transcriptional programs and can we look for enrichment in particular programs in order to figure out which of these cases uh um are interesting and which might be Just Happening by chance so we can take the 228 non-lipid coronator these jwa signals we can connect VAR genes with ABC genes to programs with perturbs and here I'm showing a plot where on the Y AIS are all 50 of the gene programs from perur and on the x-axis are the number of uh variant to Gene to program links to that program so for example the top of the list is program arbitrary number eight uh which actually has uh contains 18 different genes um that are linked to coronary disease variants and that's about four or fivefold more than you'd expect by chance if you were for example just to shuffle the variant to Gene and Gene to program assignments and it's highly statistically significant and overall um out of these uh all of these programs there are five that are significantly enriched for uh having a large number of variant program links um including all the programs I showed on the previous slide uh involved in flow response extracell Matrix organization NG Genesis platelet Recruitment and focal adhesions so next we can look at these programs a little more carefully and figure out what they represent um so for example we can take these top five programs and say what are the genes in those programs that actually have these variant to gen to program links um and this figure on the on the left summarizes uh uh the the genes that are um driving the enrichment for these top five programs um on the y-axis are is this list there are 41 uh different genes um here along the x-axis are the five significantly enriched programs um at the top uh are the number are the genes that when you perturb them actually regulate the others and regulate these programs and on the bottom are the genes that are co-regulated uh in response to these perturbations so for example again for this top program 8 um there are two genes that when you knock them down and perturb seek they regulate the program and then uh Downstream of those genes there are another uh 16 or so um that uh that are co-regulated together as a set um you know we can go in and figure out whether this list of genes looks reasonable by various metrics um you know we felt we feel pretty good about this set um so for example there are four genes in this list that were previously known to to affect coronary disease risk through functions and endothelial cells including for example um endl nitric oxide synthase which is one the key genes uh that defines vascular function um out of these 41 genes there are nine that affect AOS sclerosis or vascular Berry function when knocked out in mice in a way that's consistent with them acting in epithelial cells um and if we use alternative approaches for Gast prioritization like the polygenic uh priority score um from Hillary fukin lab a large number of the genes are very highly ranked by those methods as well so overall we think we've come up now with a list of uh five specific Gene programs and 41 specific genes in in uh genomewide significant Loi uh that we think acting endothelial cells to affect coronary disease risk so there's lots of interesting genes to dig into uh among this list but I I just wanted to highlight the two at the very top top um which as you can see from this heat map are Regulators of each are Regulators of four of the five programs um the first one ccm2 is named as such because um rare loss of function mutations in this Gene uh cause cause cerebral cavernous malformations which are these vascular lesions in the brain and it turns out that um in this Gene there's a common coding variant associated with coronary disease through gwas um that actually lands in um one of the same protein domains as uh some of these rare loss of function variants have been observed to cause vascular lesions in the brain we can look up the effect of ccm2 um in in perturb seek and in particular because it plays this really important role in in this vascular disease uh CCM pathway has been studied um extensively it turns out that there are for example two other members of the CCM complex called crit one and pdcd1 um that also carry uh loss rare loss of function variants that lead to to various vascular lesions um and it's known that this uh complex acts Upstream of the mech 5 KK 5 signaling pathway and KF 4 and so uh what I'm showing you here is a drawing of some of the Gen gen that are known to interact either physically or functionally with CCM complex and we've colored them based on their effect in perur so basically the the structure of this diagram is from prior knowledge but the coloring is from perturb experiment what you can see is that um all of the genes that are sort of uh in the CCM complex or Upstream are having um One Direction of effect on the downstream gene expression programs associated with coronary disease and the genes Downstream um in the mech uh irk 5 signaling pathway for example lead to the opposite direction of effect uh which is consistent with what was previously known that the CCM complex inhibits this this signaling Cascade um we can also look at the specific genes that we know that have been previously studied and uh what we find for example is that uh knockdown of ccm2 leads to upregulation of certain genes that were previously known to be protective including nitric oxide Sy synthes and downregulation of genes that are know to promote risk through Mouse models of bathro uh and so just from looking in this perturb experiment we can uh prioritize ccm2 as a a likely new uh Gene involved in coronary disease risk we can also um Trace its role in this transcriptional pathway and we can assign it a putative direction of effect and in particular we think that this um Miss variant likely uh inhibit ccm2 function um and that that inhibition of the CCM complex function is actually protected for coronary disease so this wanted to just share just one more Gene that we looked at in detail um and that's this second Gene um on the list that also regulates many of the of the programs um this is the locus I showed you before where there's an endothal cell specific enhancer predicted to regulate ton rd1 um ton rd1 is actually the strongest regular regulator of the five uh enriched coroner disease programs along with ccm2 it hasn't really been studied there are two papers on it in the previously one of them showed that it bundles actin um one showed that it affects migration in a cancer cell line but it's never been studied in endothelial cells there no animal models that have studied its function and so it was a surprising Gene for us to find uh on this list uh to cut a long story short we think that this Gene um actually acts in the CCM pathway and as possibly a new member of the CCM complex um uh from the perturb data we can see that it actually has the same transcriptional phenotype as knocking down ccm2 and perhaps even stronger than knocking down ccm2 um and so we investigated whether T rd1 and ccm2 might physically interact and we plug them into alpha alpha fold and find that there are domains that are predicted to interact and we did coips to show that they can uh they Co to precipitate with each other um we knock them down in endal cells and looked at various uh uh endothal cell functional phenotypes in in vitro and so for example both ccm2 and T nrd1 when you knock them down lead to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and uh lead to improvements in um endothelial cell barrier function turns out that ccm2 has previously been studied in zebra fish and has a very characteristic developmental phenotype that where you knock down ccm2 um and the heart doesn't develop properly um and it turns out that when you knock down t rd1 uh the same phenotype is observed where you have this looping defect and paracardial Emma um uh and and uh you know the fish which ends up being embryonic lethal so altogether we think that this uh Gene tard1 is a new Gene affects coronary disease risk that acts in the CCM pathway um likely by regulating end cell barrier function so to summarize uh this approach we built a gene regulation map in endothelial cells using the activity by contact model we built a systematic catalog of je programs by perturbing all genes in an unbiased way and using this high content transcriptional readout with perturbs in order to study their functions and that by tracing the path from variant to Gene program we actually can find convergence on particular gene expression programs in endothelial cells and uh this information allows us to prioritize new genes is likely relevant to coronary disease risk so we're really excited about this approach um and you know aside from a few of the steps around you know that I presented today you know manually annotating the programs and studying the functions of genes using specific you know zebra fish or endothelial cell resistance models this entire approach can be duplicated and applied to new cell types and many different diseases and I think um it's an exciting challenge for us to think about as Community um uh as part of the igf Consortium for example about how we could build uh Gene regulation similar Gene regulation maps in many hundreds or thousands of cell types in the human body um could we go and apply perturb seek to dozens of different cell types either you know at thousands of genes or perhaps genome scale in order to build a catalog of Gene programs and apply this to systematically link variants to genes to programs many common complex traits um I wanted to end by highlighting a few computational challenges that I think are interesting and and relevant to this audience um about how we could best build a catalog of Gene programs I presented you know very briefly uh here one approach that we took which was um you know applying perturb seek using this non- negative Matrix factorization approach finding genes that regulate the components from that uh Matrix Factor ization model but which you know seemed to work well and we have various analyses and and met metrics to you know benchmark that we're finding reasonable things but I think it's an open question about how we could best Define gene programs or Gene regulatory networks from perturb seek data um how do we develop good computational models to do that how do we figure out if we've done it done a good job um another computational challenge is how did we best combine this catalog Gene programs with genetic data find cell programs for disease you know we we've we do think that combining both variant to Gene information and Gene program information is essential um we and several other recent Studies have shown that um but exactly the best methodological way to do that that I think is an open area to explore um and then finally a much uh I think a bigger challenge is um you know we we can do perturb seek in vitro we can do perturb seek in mice in Vivo but ultimately what we want to know is what genes do in their in you know human cell types in a tissue for example during the process of aerosis and we're not going to be able to go in and do perur seek um you know in the right exactly right cell type so how can we take the data that you know we obtain from pertur or from massive single cell alyses and start to make causal inferences about what genes do in cell types in their native conditions um I think you know one framing of this challenge for the field is you know could we build bottels to predict the effect of a gene peration on the transcriptome and any new cell type given just single cell RNA and attack seek in that cell type so I I think those are some of the the interesting computational challenges that um I think would be fun to think about together so with that I'd like to thank uh again uh Gavin and Helen we the co-first authors on this study we just posted preprint on by archive last week um and co-conspirator Raj Gupta um as well as many members of both the Gupta lab and my lab uh here at Stanford um thanks so much for the invitation and the opportunity to speak today and I'm happy to take any questions thanks Jesse um so I'm going to pass the mic here uh on the inperson audience if anyone on Zoom has a question feel free to just unmute yourself and ask your question I see Steve has his hand raised yeah so I'll go ahead hey Jesse good to see you um great talk as always uh I'm I'm really curious about um a a lot of this especially from like an eqtl perspective and a lot of times at a dios Locus eqtl data will nominate multiple different Target genes from the same signal I assume ABC does that also and I'm curious about after you go through your nmf clustering do different genes from the same Locus appear in the same program or are they in different programs as does that and does that kind of information potentially help you prioritize what might be the causal Gene at a Locus if there's a single causal Gene among multiple putatively linked genes does that make sense yes yes we um we looked at this in this study and um I don't I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head but the the short answer is yes the intersection is really powerful at reducing the number of candidates um uh I I suppose so multiple potential Target genes end up in different programs and one program different programs or perhaps not you know not in a program at all yeah okay and and so um yeah I which in terms of why variants and enhancers regulate multiple genes I mean that's just how the genome is wired and you know they regulate genes with different effect sizes and you know different genes might respond be differentially dose dependent and and so forth so I think this additional layer of knowing what the genes do what programs they act in will be really important for um finding the right genes um I think there are you know other variant V variations on this type of analysis of like combining the variant to Gene information with Gene pathway information um like in Eric Fan's work and in Hillary's pops paper and I think those are all consistent with like you want to intersect these two pieces pieces of information um we did find a few Loi where there were uh two genes that were both linked to the variant and also um in an enriched program sometimes in the same program um and so there could be cases where the variant affects the trait through effects on two different genes um you know we're we're thinking about how we could you know effectively really prove that model in some of these cases uh which which could be tricky but um uh in most of the cases I think in third 3 I think um I think the 41 genes were in 37 Lo Loi so there are four Loi with two genes each and the rest had one gene each okay cool cool very cool thanks I have a question on your hypothesis on convergence to pathway from snip to gen so uh is how strongly ACC this hypo is a convergence and you you map snip to Gin but within a gin you have multiple Snips some could be protective some could be know risk so why you need to map to the Gin why don't operate at the snip level yeah so um so for the second question about why map to the gene um so in most of these jasi um at least for coronary disease there's a single variant associated with disease risk at least for coronary disease risk and the question is one of the key questions that we want to know is like which Gene is regulated um and so we do want to find we want to map to the gene because we want to find a gene uh in Parts um but it's true that in many cases like for example in the example of the ccm2 gene that I showed there are different types of variants that lead to different effects on diseases and you on different diseases so you do need to understand and operate at the variant level to some extent to figure out um you know how dramatically or in which cell types does each variant affect the expression of the gene so there's certainly um a layer of complexity in terms of the direction of effective variant and you know the extent to which there might be multiple gwos varant in a uh independent signals in a given Locus that we have not considered here um but yeah I I think that's a really interesting direction for the future and um we're going to need better tools to predict for example the direction effect of a non-coding variance on gene expression in terms of convergence can you talk talk a little bit why we assume there's a convergence yeah well so this is um I I guess the idea of convergence is just I guess our or one way of describing the observation that um for any given disease there's probably some particular molecular process in a given cell type that's driving the disease um in the case of coronary disease for example we know that lipid uh production or LDL cholesterol production by the liver and hepatocytes is one of the really key uh processes that regulates disease risk and if you look at the different gwas variants that are discovered um in you know for this highly polygenic trait it turns out that many of them end up regulating cholesterol biosynthesis in various ways so um and this is seen in in many different complex traits that there's convergence onto some particular pathway within a cell type um and so that's the that's the signature that we're looking for except that we don't know what those path ways would be in general and we want to try to uh find those in some systematic way thank you thanks for your question U Jesse I have a question um this kind of a technical question about perturb seek um so perturb seek reads out the identity of the per in a Cell by sequencing the guide RNA but I wonder um is it ever important to try to determine if the um Gene was actually knocked down in that cell aside from the identity of the guide yes so this is um an important technical consideration for Pb seek that I don't think the community has a great solution for yet um in general um different guide rnas for a given Gene have varying efficiencies in crisper eye and so we're assuming in this particular study for example we have 15 different guide rnas per promoter in part because it's hard to predict which ones will work well so we want to make sure to sort of hedge our bets and make sure that there are at least some that work well um many of them will work to varying degrees you know between 20% knockdown to 80% knock down and so in our particular analysis we're just averaging over all of those effects uh because it's actually quite difficult at the level of any single cell to determine what the knockdown is because of the you know you don't get enough coverage of the target Gene in order to actually assess that at the level of a single cell um in theory if one collected a lot of single cells for a given guide RNA you could do a better job of estimating what the knockdown would be but um you know depending on where the guide is integrated in the cell the guide might be expressed to different levels so there's still going to be some variation in how well the knockdown Works um and so practically I mean what we're really seeing then is the sort of the composite effect of many different levels of knockdowns across different cells and in our statistical test just kind of looking for a general shift in in Downstream gene expression um but I'm sure that there are better um ways of modeling that um technical detail and then perhaps you know using that to better refine and extract significant regulatory Pathways and perhaps even learning something about the dose dependence I see um if you could read out an additional M from the cell would that help like maybe reading out the methylation level of the Locust or something so yeah one approach is to use like a a dial out like the targeted perturb seek approach which might tell you about the um give you a better handle on the exact level of knockdown in each single cell um I think that would probably be the the the most effective readout um for for that specific quantity um I'm not sure about the the methylome I think that well yeah I think that would give you another layer of information definitely but um I'm not sure it would it would uh I'm not sure it would tell you um about the specific machine but anyway I'd love to discuss that further great thanks all right well it looks like there are no other questions so let's thank Jesse again thanks again for the invitation thank you for all your questions um and yes I would love to discuss this further with um and looking forward to connecting soon great thanks
