so I was just gonna get going so thank you for inviting me and thanks to Alan for bringing me up here and especially thank you for your moving all the snow off the ground before I got here I'm a Southern California boy as you can tell when you're going to Santa Cruz so this the snow thing is once this card is going what I'm going to talk to you up today is a research project that I've started at UNC in close collaboration with dr. Shahzad Sheikh who's a PhD MD PhD with the clinical focus in the inflammatory bowel diseases it's been really a lot of fun and it's been done sort of building on the infrastructure that at UNC within their Center for Center for there we go so this is done within the context of the singer for in gastrointestinal biology and disease over at UNC that that really has become a leader in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases but especially inflammatory bowel diseases involved is an ID decay has Senator grant but importantly for the stuff that we're doing has been a great resource in being able to obtain patient samples Shahzad has has played a large role in developing a tissue bank and working with the surgeons there to give us the precious material to be able to run the experiments that we're trying to Runyan and understand IBD from a more molecular perspective alright so well which I knew which button to push we were fortunately I need to show you a little bit more than business so basic outline of my talk today I want to start off and and and just go over a little bit about Crohn's disease so that you're familiar with the different aspects of it that'll be important for today's talk I'm gonna take a couple of slides and just describe this idea of selling your identity that I think it's going to be very familiar to most of you but this sort of set the stage for the to been different studies that will follow one where we've looked at this in the context of a mouse model the Isleton knocked out and the second one where we were looking at patient samples colon tissue from patient samples and it's mad as my title said that we've uncovered these two molecular subtypes that we're very excited about okay good all right so IBD what is IBD it's a big problem right now and it's one of these diseases that in this Western you know westernized I'm part of the world becoming worse whether the incidence is increasing because we're getting better at identifying and diagnosing it or whether it's because a lot more people are contracting the disease probably a combination of both that it's becoming a large problem and one of those that I read a statistic noted a the 20% of us have a relative that has it most of us probably don't even know it this is a disease of young people most of the age of onset is usually in your your adolescent years your early 20s and often these these patients are coming in and they've been misdiagnosed over and over again and by the time that they get to a facility like you and see the disease's progressed and these patients are just miserable which yeah I'm just gonna have to I don't like standing behind the podium but I think I'm gonna have to so so the inflammatory bowel disease is actually an umbrella term it's a collection of diseases the two that we're most familiar with are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and I'm going to be talking mostly about Crohn's disease but just to show that these are a heterogeneous set of diseases ulcerative colitis is generally a general inflammation of the colon in a very contiguous way and envelops pretty much the whole colon whereas Crohn's disease is different in that it can actually affect tissue as they say from gum to bum from your mouth to your anus and it's primarily seeing in the terminal part of the small intestine the ileum and then within the colon and what's unique about this compared to ulcerative colitis is that what you will see is you will see patches of affected tissue that are right next to the other tissue that looked perfectly normal and you will have these sort of patchwork presentation the disease throughout the intestine from a clinical standpoint it's also a very heterogeneous disease both in the location as I described although primarily they they classify this as being affecting the ileum affecting the colon or affecting both of them but even when you look at the affected regions there's multiple presentations from just a general inflammation so the formation of these ulcers or these little holes within the lining of the intestine to a structuring where you see this narrowing of the intestine that can cause blockages to fistula in which you actually the the intestinal wall is completely perforated and it can form these tunnels back to the intestine or to other organs of the body including the skin that obviously is it's not a good thing like so many diseases this is a multifactorial disease there are a lot of things that seem to be contributing to the onset and progression of this sort of when you ask someone to describe Siddhi they say this is an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota in a genetically susceptible individual so those three components are generally accepted as all contributing to that what we don't know is how much each of those contributes and exactly why people get this disease generally it's associated with some kind of environmental trigger which is very not well understood you know that the diet smoking other sort of environmental factors can increase the severity of the disease in ways that really are not understood from a genetic standpoint they have Dungey was on this and I'm sure that a lot of you have seen these papers about the GU odds of IBD this has actually been one of the very successful ones we've got over 200 low-sided have been associated with the disease but similar other G wise experiments almost none of these have been well characterized the vast majority of them are in non-coding regions and we really don't understand how they're contributing to the disease more importantly from Shahzad standpoint and being involved in and sort of didn't a chance to be involved on the clinical side all these dae-hwa's experiments that identified dental ocation of all these associated lows I have not really translated into the clinic so when she was odd sees a patient his knowledge of where all these associated low side does nothing in how he treats his patient or his ability to improve the condition of his patients so like so many other people you know this is what we're trying to do is figure out how can we take all this knowledge that we're gaining and turn it into information that can help in a clinical setting and so in addition to that I you know currently on the clinical side there is a clinical classification system that's based on the location and on these different behavioral phenotypes but even that system has not translated into knowing how to treat patients that are being able to predict the progression of the disease so just because you present with general inclination that really doesn't tell you whether you might go on to develop strictures or it's fistulas or whether you're going to respond to certain treatments or not so like in so many diseases we feel that if we can understand Crohn's disease better at the molecular level we might be able to predict or understand different clinical aspects of the disease such as response to treatment how it's going to progress and whether there's a recurrence so the focus of our studies has been doing this is to really try to understand the disease from the clinical level so I told you I wanted to sort of to spend a couple minutes talking a little bit about this idea of cellular differentiation and an identity so we all know but you know our genomes exactly the same in all of our selves in each of ourselves the different cell types have very unique functions and responses and largely that's due to the expression of different genes and expression levels of different genes that sort of dictate what these cells do and taking a step back even for not the expression level of these genes are then governed by the gene regulatory system which is largely the epigenetic system that influences these gene expression patterns so the way that we think about you know one way to think about differentiation is at each step a differentiation it's a reprogramming of this epigenetic state to change sort of the gene Express and patterns to allow these cells to adopt new functionality and so as you look go down to the different tissue levels each of those dissolved in each of these tissues then have the unique epigenetic program that sort of dictates what that cell does and so one way to think about disease is that now we have the condition where we have cells that are not behaving normally their gene expression programs have been altered in a bad way and a lot of this may be been driven by changes in the epigenetic programs dictating this expression program so thinking about this combination of epigenetics and regulation I think we're all very familiar with the the background thread of genomics on the epigenetic side we can talk about this in terms of different types of epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation it's been a tail modification and nucleus on repositioning and creating these areas of open chromatin where then transcription factors are allowed to by and these sort of define the epigenetic program they've been influenced there's downstream the expression of genes and micro RNAs which micro RNAs can then come back and provide another level of regulation at a transcriptional level and in this genomics era we've developed assays that are able to measure these different molecular characteristic welcome in epigenetic and from a transcriptional point of view so in my lab and as Alan sort of said a large focus on the epigenetic side had been open chromatin which initially we started off with DNA seek and and and fair seek and that now progressed to a taxi and so in the assay during the experiment that we're going to talk about today primarily going to be the combination of looking at open chromatin and affect on transcriptional output through mRNAs and micro rna's and for those you may not be familiar with open chromatin door I'm guessing that you've seen any of Alan's taught you probably are um you can think of this simply as one of these high throughput sequencing functional experiments where the output is an enrichment of sequences that indicate where regions of nuclear zone depleted open chromatin are there primarily found or a lot of the the strongest and the largest are found in promoter regions as you might imagine where all the transcriptional machinery associated with pol ii needs to bind it also includes the more distal regions where these or distant enhancers and repressor elements are binding influencing than gene regulation so the main question that we were to answer initially is do we find evidence that in Crohn's disease is there a reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape that is contributing to the onset and progression of this disease to first establish a potential role for chromatin in this we started we started with a mouse model of kaleidos which is the il-10 knockout mouse Isleton itself is a cytokine that is one of the key anti-inflammatory cytokines by regulating in at kappa b and it's so it suppresses inflammation so by knocking it out these mice will spontaneously develop colitis in the presence of bacteria or in presence of the normal microbiota in this particular study we chose to to look at one particular immune cell type the macrophage is in the gut and the reason why we're looking at macrophages is they play a key role in this inflammatory response as part of the immune system but macrophages though within the testing are very unique compared to macrophages that are found in the rest of the body and that like macrophages is in the rest of the body one of its main jobs is to identify and eliminate harmful bacteria but if we think about our normal intestine there are a lot of bacteria and other microbiota that live in the intestine and that are good bacteria I'm working in the symbiotic way to help improve digestion and absorption so the macrophages has been gut do not want to mount the inflammatory response and the presence of this bacteria because this inflammatory response would serve to damage the tissue and so there needs to be a tolerance of this bacteria within the gut and so the presence of this inflammation seems to indicate a an aberrant activity of these macrophages in response to this bacteria so to look at this we looked at both wild-type and il-10 knockout mouse mice and we looked at peripheral macrophages so bone marrow derived macrophages to see what what did a macrophage look like that is normally programmed to mount an inflammatory supply in addition to the net intestinal macrophages that should be programmed not to mount this antipas inflammatory response all right so this is so there's animation but I don't think I'm gonna be able to show you because clicking on it's not going to work anyway so our overall design is to look at open chromatin and transcription in these the peripheral and intestinal macrophages from these two lights and look at how they react in the presence in the absence of bacteria and sort of trying to look at this a little bit more concretely so here I've shown some open chromatin signals from in peripheral macrophages in wild-type animals both in the presence in the absence of bacteria and so what we're looking for are these changes based on the introduction of bacteria or in looking at peripheral and intestinal macrophages differences between the two of them when we look specifically at the peripheral macrophages both in the wild-type and IELTS and knockout mice and in the presence and absence of bacteria we found three distinct types of chromatin regions the first two that were related to a response to bacteria so these are chromatin regions that in both the Isleton knockout and in the wild side lines either became more open on presence on exposure to bacteria and the introduction of bacterial regions that became more closed on introduction of bacteria they're seemingly regulating than genes that are important to the response to bacteria but then we saw this interesting third class which were regions that were more open or more closed in Isleton knockout mice in general regardless of whether bacteria was introduced or not and if we notice here the majority looking at the peripheral macrophages the majority or this type of the inducible type that are opening up or based on the presence of bacteria so that our next question was do we see something similar in the intestinal macrophages and how does that compare to these peripheral macrophages so in the same way we found these three classes again those that became more open on the presence of backtick said these are slightly different experiments because now intestinal McAfee are normally exposed to bacteria so in this case we had mice that were either raised unconventionally meaning in the presence of bacteria or mice that were raised in a nota biotic facility where conditions where there was germ-free condition and so as I was saying so we had basically the same three classes where the more open in the presence of bacteria closed down in the presence of bacteria and in these Isleton regulated class class of element well what I want you to notice is that in this case the vast majority of these are in this Isleton regulated class so more chromatin changes were occurring based on the the elimination of the Isleton the absence of Isleton than in response to the bacteria when we look more closely at these Isleton regulated regions in the intestinal macrophages and compare these to the peripheral macrophages what we what we found was that there was a large overlap between nodes that changed on the absence of Isleton compared to those that were induced by the presence of bacteria in the and the peripheral macrophages which suggests to us that the elimination of Isleton is reprogramming these intestinal macrophages so now look more like what these peripheral macrophages look like and thus taking on the characteristics of inducing this inflammatory response in the presence of bacteria so do not raise the question of wealth so if we simply added back Aisle 10 could be returned worst genotype within the colitis model with the Nile to knockout model and actually aisle 10 therapy is something that has been tried in treatment of Crohn's disease what we found was that while by introducing Isleton we could change the expression of mini Isleton regulated genes and either upregulated or downregulated as they normally are when Isleton is present when we looked at the chromatin know the chromatin didn't change so simply adding back Isleton is not able to reprogram commenting back to its original state where it can tolerate the bacteria and so if you remove Isleton it's simply going to revert back to its inflammatory state which we think is might be a reason why in these trials of these Isleton therapy for the large part they have not worked well and we think it's because it's not able to reprogram these cells back to their normal state it's just sort of a band-aid that temporarily can fix it is not curing the underlying molecular situation the summarizing this first part so what we think we've shown is that the absence of Isleton is reprogramming the chromatin landscape within intestinal macrophages and one thing I didn't point out but this reprogramming is happening even in the absence of bacteria so even these mice that are being raised in the germ-free environment we still see these changes in the chromatin environment so it's not that Isleton not nice are being exposed to bacteria and this is some how we program these though they're reprogramming from the beginning during the differentiation process something is going wrong but whatever reason Alton that isn't involved in any kind of epigenetic programming it doesn't modify chromatin at all so now the absence of that is creating this incorrect program cell and the the sort of the consequence of this reprogramming is now these macrophages have lost their tolerance to the bacteria and induced this inflammatory response that simply adding back il10 cannot restore so it's great to sort of establish this in mice and a model but what about human Crohn's disease so using patients that material from patients at UNC that sure God's colleagues were able to obtain we looked at colon tissue and we looked at colon tissue that was from uninfected regions of the colon so these are non claimed by eye surgeons look at it it looked like perfectly normal tissue but from patients with crohn's disease and we also looked at another small cohort of patients that did not have IBD I want to call them healthy but they didn't have intestinal inflammation and with these tissues we looked at there aren't we looked at there Mike mRNA micro RNA and chromatin profiles and normally when you perform expression experiments like this you see that all right you often will do something simple like a clustering a hierarchical clustering or a PCA analysis just to see whether you see different patients that are clustering in different ways and so we did this assuming that we get the I you know combs these patients that we clustered together and we would get the non IBD patients that clustered together but surprisingly we wind did this we did find two very distinct clusters but not clusters that initially made sense to us he saw one group of CD patients that would cost it all off by themselves like we expected but another cluster that that were more similar to the normal patients and when we looked at the genes that were driving this clustering we found something really interesting we found that in this off group away from the normal IBD patients a lot of the genes that were being upregulated for genes that were normally only turned on in the ileum whereas when we compared the two groups at between this you know off group and the group OCD patients that was near the normal the non IBD cohort a lot of the genes that were upregulated there were genes that were normally only seen regulated within the colon and this led us to sort of call these things a colon light group and an ileum light group now initially we were very skeptical and we spent about two months going back and staring at slides and making sure did we mess up on the tissue do we actually get ileum tissue but after a couple of months we convinced ourselves it wasn't a tissue next up this was actually present when we looked at the open chromatin landscape he saw very distinct differences between these two years as well and open chromatin regions that were being opened and closed that were directly related to these genes that were being differentially expressed we further looked using roadmap epigenomics data at histone modifications that were typically only seen in either ileum or the colon and found as well that those genes those chromatin regions that were associated with the colon like group had histone modifications that were more specific to the colon so you're activating march h3k27 a settlement that were more associated that were only present within the colon but in our area like subgroup when we looked at we saw a histone modifications that were enriched that were normally only seen within the ileum tissue so for multiple levels we're seeing evidence that for some reason we've got this aberrant subgroup that seems to be acting very similar to a more ileal like phenotype and so we labeled these like I said an ileal light group in this : light group and so our next question was well these are adult patients they were the tissue that we use were from resections and so these were patients for disease had progressed to a pretty severe state they had been through a lot of different treatments that could have affected this cellular reprogramming so what we wanted to know is this something inherent to the disease or is it just reflective of the state of these patients so fortunate for us there had been a study that had been done on a cohort of pediatric patient that were treatment naive so the initially diagnosed had not gone through all these exposures the disease had not progressed as in the adults and we wanted to see where we saw whether we saw a similar pattern and what we found was when we did the principal component analysis using data from those I want to add into this that these fish the pediatric patients these samples will thumb the ilium now whereas the adult patients these were samples from the colon when we did a PCA analysis on all the samples put together we found that you know the initial separation was between the two cohort but the on PC - which divides in the adult population or aisle like and our CLO like group we also saw a separation among the pediatric patients it wasn't as distinct is in the adult patients but we definitely saw patients that seemed to have a more colon like phenotype even though they were from the ileum and others that had in a more ileal light phenotype where on the right as well we see the black dots that are normal ileum and we see that those are all towards the bottom of PC - or on the pot on the negative side of PT - so they're grouping again with our ileal like subtype and adult and what we're suggesting is a more ileal like subtype within the pediatric patients and obviously since we did this on using gene expression data from both of these cohorts these were similar genes that we're driving this phenotype in both sets of patients so our next question is will some so what are these genes doing so we did a pathway analyses I'm gonna get a hang of this all right now and so anyone that's done a pathway analyses knows you come back with a lot of different interesting things to look look at but I want to try to distill this down a little bit for you so on the Left we have our adult cohort right we have our pediatric cohort and what I want you to take away is there's sort of two different classes of pathways that we see differ between different between the two immune related pathways and metabolic related pathways and on the near side received a different signaling pathways including interleukin interferon the nod to toll-like receptor pathways suggesting that the immune response between these two different classes of patients is slightly different now when we did this analysis comparing both of these classes to normal or non IBD patients we saw you know there were definitely differences there it indicated the reflected the inflammatory response that was present in Sidi patience but we're still seeing the differences between these two populations in their immune system response the second are all these metabolic pathways which isn't that surprising since this is such a metabolically active tissue both of them are metabolically active tissue but what we see is we see differences in lipid metabolism that may be reflecting differences in the epithelial barrier barrier that is made up of lipids and its ability to keep the enteric microbiota out of in the lumen and out of the the yes where it's not supposed to be we all see I'm sorry part of this is anyway so we also see vena biotic metabolism which is dealing with the foreign agents and microbial presence within the gut we see energy metabolism in both cases we see a upregulation in the TCA cycle so we see a shift in energy metabolism towards the TCA cycle and a bit away from the go Ico lytic cycle and see so we see fundamental differences in activity within these two classes of patient we also wanted to look at additional molecular characteristics of these patients and so with the help of Praveen Sethupathi in his lab that is focused on micro rna's we also look at it micro rna's and performing PCA analysis based on micro RNA expression we could exactly we capitulate our two classes suggesting that this epigenetic reprogramming is also affecting the transcription of micro rna's we dug deeper into the micro rna's that might be driving this response okay so now we get the whole everything all together and we found in particular there was one micro RNA near 31 that it seems to be much more highly expressed in our ileum like cohort compared to our colon like cohort near 31 is normally very highly expressed in the ileum and is not expressed in the colon which this reflects and we know the colon tissue is made up a lot of different self right which is like so we actually see that mir 31 is upregulated in even the colon like data type so the presence of disease seems to upregulate near 31 but it's really in this subtype of the ileum like class the ileum like patient where we see this extreme upregulation in near 31 all right the interesting okay so this is a make sure that everyone understands what a mere micro rna's do this is a boat like i said a post transcriptional regulator of mRNA levels and these micro rna's that are transcribed target mRNAs by binding to generally target regions within their three prime UTR it's the press either target them for degradation or interfere with their translation into protein all right and the point of something you missed is that each of these microRNAs can target several different genes there's not a one-to-one correspondence between and so what we wanted to know is we find evidence that near thirty-one is actually my master regulator of mRNA expression between these two subclasses and the way that we looked at this is using a program that was developed in the Sethupathi lab called Mir hub and what we specifically wanted to look for were micro rna's that were upregulated in this case in our ileum like subclass that whose targets were at the same time shown to be down regulated in that class since we know that these microwaves are targeting and resulting in the down regulation of these genes and so we looked at all micro rna's with all differentially regulated mRNAs and of the all of the micro rna's it was again near 31 that stood out as a mat is the only master regulator suggesting that it's up regulation was actually contributing to the differential expression at the mRNA level between these two cell types hey so colon tissue is a complex tissue consisting of several different types of cells different immune cell populations and epithelial layer and so looking at this in colon tissue and this is a problem with anyone that's looking at heterogeneous tissue you really don't understand which differential regulation or differential programming is having the largest effect and so in sheds odds lab they've been able to sort colonic tissue into multiple different populations including macrophages T cells B cells in the epithelial layer and each and each one of those populations we looked at selves derived from patients with Crohn's disease and patients without Crohn's and we measured the near 31 level and we found overall a general upregulation in year 31 in each one of the cell different cell population but as is very apparent on this slide although it's not going to pop up we have a hundredfold app regulation in the epithelial cells which in the micro RNA world is almost unheard of usually you're looking for sort of a two twofold induction of expression but to see something induced to this level was pretty amazing but so going back to sort of our original focus of this it's it's it's all great too to be able to do these molecular studies and find these out but you know G was has not been able to contribute in a meaningful way to in a clinical setting and so we wanted to know so is knowing that there these two subtypes exist is that tell us anything useful about clinical characteristics of these patients so we did an association with many different types of clinical characteristics that with some that turned out to be significant which I had highlighted but essentially what we found was that those patients in the colon like subgroup were those that were more apt to require a complete colectomy that would have perianal involvement or rectal involvement whereas those in the iliyan like Haute were those that were more likely to have ileal involvement so this is you know obviously a very small collection of patients we only had 21 Crohn's disease patients and 11 non idd patient and so we were amazed that we were even able to find this these significant of associations even with this small number okay but just summarizing the second part what we think we've shown very convincingly is that there exists two at least two molecular subtypes within crohn's disease that have very distinct molecular profiles that are shown at the chromatin level at the mRNA level and at the micro RNA level and I haven't shown you that it's also when we looked at long non-coding RNAs you also saw this and all these together are suggesting that the cells within these two different cohorts are completely programmed in very different ways and especially in ileal like cohort and the adults these are being very fundamentally reprogrammed to UM take on functions that are not seen normally in the colon and very encouragingly we did find that they were associated with different clinical phenotypes so just to kind of wrap up a bit so what I hope I've convinced you or we were trying to convince people is that if you think about this from the idea of you have a cell yo identity that is defined by your epigenetic program your that leads to a particular gene expression profile that in disease often what you are going to see is you're going to see a reprogramming of this epigenetic landscape that is going to be changing the function of these cells and making them act in ways that they aren't supposed to you and in Crohn's disease and particularly in macrophages that's reprogramming them to contribute to this inflammatory response this aberrant inflammatory response in the presence of microbiota leading to inflammation and tissue damage within the cells we know that there is a genetic component and obviously we haven't done enough patients to be able to fully investigate the genetic component you also know that the genetics can influence this epigenetic programming so this in our minds can provide a potential link where we see based on a genetic background we're seeing a slight reprogramming of epigenetic landscape that in the presence of the microbiota is now triggering this aberrant inflammatory response so we're excited about this and we've got a lot of big plans which I hope to show you first thing we want to do is we want to scale this up to a lot more people we've been funded now to replicate these chromatin and expression experiments and many more examples to see whether we again can replicate on these two subtypes that we initially fly in but then also see whether we can find additional subtypes that might indicate a slightly different molecular programming leading to different clinical outcomes in addition to looking at tissues we also want to look more at individual cell types so we can understand more from a mechanistic standpoint how these differences in the epigenetic landscape are contributing specifically to sell the individual cellular reprogramming and changing their function leading to this inflammatory phenotype the enteric microbiota is obviously contributing to this and so we are we have embarked on some microbial sequencing to see if we see differences in the communities that are present it's not only CD versus non IBD but also within our molecular subtypes as I showed a lot of the pathways that are being affected in these molecular subtypes are related to metabolic processes so we're gathering samples to send off to do some metabolomics to see if we see very distinct metabolic profiles reflecting this change in metabolic activity both between just even CD and non IBD but between our molecular phenotypes we've started working with IBD doctors at UNC to specifically treat pediatric patients because a lot of people in the field you know like to really get at the root of the disease we need to be examining patients that at the initial diagnosis before they've gone through these rounds of treatment and and before the disease has been allowed to progress to these more extreme phenotypes and to see whether we start seeing hints of these this molecular reprogramming in early on in these pediatric patients and of course you know - we want to perform more functional experiments to understand exactly what's going on in these cells so in God's lab they've been able to create colon OIG's and in towards which essentially extracting epithelial cells from these patients and being able to grow them up and form sort of these new guts many organs but then we can experiment with using different microbial products and changing the expression of genes within needs to see how they react to give us some better sense for how this epigenetic programming may be affecting almost cellular function so obviously with project like this with many different facets we have a lot of people that are involved so in my lab both on the computational and analytic side and Shahzad lab that are doing a lot of experimentation including and are equally important trying to understand [Music] [Applause] well as far as I know we don't have any human patients they've been raised in an nota biotic it's a it's a great question and I don't know the answer to that I would so come from sort of our point of view it's throughout the the stages of differentiation it's going to be affected by a particular environment that those cells are differentiating so for these cells that are entering the dot what we feel is that the environment within the gut has changed so that now the epigenetic reprogramming is being changed based on that environment whether it's partly influenced by the presence of different colonies of bacteria we don't know but so if we somehow we could manipulate maybe one way to look at this is it somehow we could manipulate the bacterial colonies and see whether that's a now rescued and normal at the genetic phenotype but to eliminate the bacteria we do know that yeah you know can't do it like you can in my second question about how yeah I could bake about kimochi the second part of human fibroblasts right away and micro kneeling like subpage so so it it is hard you sort of relate the two and really the the reasoning behind the two studies is one person in the mice is just a way you more definitively showed that there is this reprogramming happening in the presence of a chronic and flat intestinal inflammation phenotype but we're not trying to say that the changes that we see there are necessarily going to be the same changes that are driving clothes disease in human we probably will see certain you know we do see some similarity in genes that are being affected but it was really it was sort of established in the field and this is in the field of IBD that we need to be looking at chromatin we need to be looking at epigenetics this is important in the disease so then we presented them with the human data we can point to it and say you know sort of we have this precedent but it does make you question how good are these mouths muffled of disease they really how much can we learn in these mouse models that will translate into sort of two related questions now that you have your samples subdivided into two groups or three groups if you take the non IBD and people out if you know overlay the 203 G was hits is there anything that the 203 G versus post-facto can are different I mean are there some that are that are sort of specific to some subtypes and not others and related if you look at the epidemiology or the clinical history can you say that you know the kids that are in one in the ilium group are the ones that got five by five times infection and got bombarded with antibiotics or anything in the history that might have something to do with a microbiome or with the environment that was changed okay so so to answer your first question when we look at so it's been like I said it's been hard to study the generators we have such a few samples when we look at the gene loss that we and we looked just overall at regions that are changed between CV and non IBD we've seen enrichment and loci associated with the Jia sits in these rain in the differences between those two large pots we don't really see an enrichment one way or the other when comparing say the ileal light sub pipe and there we being sort of reluctant to dive into the generic field until we've been able to do this and many more patients you know in our small level we just you know when we look at specific genotypes in these patients for not seeing any obvious correlations with Jiwon as far as relationships sort of a history of the patients this is why we think a pediatric cohort is so important and really the patients that are involved here are ones that we are getting samples before they've started any kind of treatment they are just initially diagnosed they haven't been put on steroids they have so whether there was a history of antibiotics in early childhood related to infections from other forces or not our patients and we don't have access to that history but there was nothing at least at the time of diagnosis that they you know these sets of patients were on antibiotics at that point they would that's the way they were treating so as far as we could tell at leasing the pediatric patients there was nothing different about their history but then like I said we don't have complete access on the adult side we did look through treatment histories and we haven't found a connection to antibiotic use or steroid use or so those are really exciting data um in part two of the talk it looks like the reprogramming is specific to the colonic epithelium correct so at least with respect to Mir 31 respecting your everyone yes so yeah so my question is do you see the inappropriate expression of intestinal cell types and those ileum like colonic samples for example Paneth cells that are like the stem cell support cells and the small intestine they don't exist in the colon so so we get this question a lot of times you know and it's Ilia like subtype is this just that you know there's been this invasion of the Paracels you know we're very you know that's the Hanna cell metaplasia phenotype that is often seen in these CD patients when we showed these cysts illogically when we showed these to pathologists and they looked at these histologically they couldn't see any difference so we don't think that it's somehow this you know just complete change by this invasion of these different cell types um so that answered part of your question but I don't feel like answered the first part of your question right so we haven't been able to look at the individual cell types and so we really don't have an idea whether you know the changes we're seeing or specific to a single cell type if they're you know the one that I did show near 31 obviously you see a much larger effect in the epithelial cells and when we look at the whole colon tissue the vast majority of cells in the colon tissue are epithelial and so it will be interesting to us to see as we start being able to do these experiments and sorted cells what changes do we see specifically to different cellular populations what do we see sort of ubiquitously across those and what might those be in the you know suggesting about changes in specific cell type functionality to this contributing in the pediatric crohn's disease patients do you also see a regulation of thirty-one we don't have my car and I did so we actually have a project right now where we are generating micro RNA data in a different set of pediatric patients to see whether we see and we are seeing differential expression across these on near 30 you haven't had a chance to really look at this in depth it's not as clean-cut as we see in adult patients which were not surprised given what we saw in the mRNA results but that does seem to be differentially regulated across the pediatric population so look and maybe some so I'm thinking of this open differentially open from a meeting or even that you was it they seem like they're back or somewhat easy to do it right so my good computational biologists the dignity of engagement and yes we've seen motifs that are enriched one of the ones that was interesting to us was a p1 but overall nothing nothing nothing that is sort of like your dream hey here's a motif at a-put you know appears in all these regions and it completely explains how they're being reprogrammed but you know all right [Applause]
