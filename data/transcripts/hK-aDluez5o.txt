introduction everybody knows dr lucia cevidanes lucia is faculty at department of [Music] orthodentix and also professor of dentistry she is one of the few faculty in the school of dentistry that has been collaborating with our department and i would say perhaps one of the few faculties in in at national at the nation who's doing this much 3d image processing and has integrated advanced machine learning and image processing technique into the clinical decision support systems she's been supervising a number of our students co-supervising a number of students and postdocs in our department research faculty she has over 140 scientific papers most of them on data science and 3d imaging applied to dentistry she has won so many uh international awards and she's currently conducting multiple funded research that are funded by different agencies including national institute of health um she's been a great collaborator of our lab so some of the people in in our lab have been co-supervised by by lucia and and and we are very happy to have lucia here as our speaker for this week so without any further delay lucia we're very honored and happy to have you with us this week thank you so very much i'm the one who's honored so let me share my screen and hopefully over the next half hour i will share with you uh the work that we have been honored to collaborate with uh researchers in your department on applications of decision support systems in dentistry uh our work that is currently funded we received in our one uh to apply data science approaches to investigate temperamental joint disorders that affect more than 10 million americans and this year in 2020 we have been fortunate to have received also an administrative supplement for raza surush mayor that has worked very closely with our lab with kavan's guidance since 2019 and our work really fits into the nidcr 2030 gold areas of um supporting research tower precision systems in dentistry as well as they do have a new portfolio uh in new funding announcements that we are looking very closely uh for our new applications on uh decision support systems um and data science approaches apply applied to dentistry conditions um the joint that we study is this very small joint here that we all have to use our mouths to chew but it has very different characteristics than the larger joints that get the bulk of the research money because these conditions for example of osteoarthritis in the knee it's very debilitating while tmj people most of the times they just live with this condition but these situations can also be extremely painful that leads to total joint prosthesis but in some cases these conditions is starting in a symptomatic way and by the time that the patient is diagnosed so much bone destruction has already occurred and that's when total prosthesis is needed and our work has taken an approach of looking at the ethiology of arthritis not just trying to identify one single marker that would be the driving factor uh in this condition because we know there is a crosstalk in the molecular pathways of inflammation angiogenesis neoreception bone opposition and oral resorption um to allow us to really understand how osteoarthritis develops so the proposed work under our funded r1 is started mainly with uh shape analysis and this is just to show like how the condyle in the lower jaw looks in patients that do not have the disease and how some bone destruction is starts to occur initially with proliferation of bone in the anterior aspect of the joint but it's in long term the disease is degenerative uh with the condyles becoming a lot smaller in a typical bone destruction in the lateral portion of the joint in our previous work um in 2018 we had identified some different groups and stages of the generation but looking mostly at the 3d morphology in that early diagnosis um even in stage one of the generation we had already seen marked bone loss we also did since 2014 in the work that some work that i started at unc some statistical uh multivariate functional analysis to correlate the level of the markers with specific areas of the condyle this work i think was very interesting but we did get some criticism in the sense that how is it possible that the level of the markers will really correlate with the meshes in the thousands of points because this is a high-dimensional problem and how robust are these correlations uh so moving on to the aims for our current work utilizing data science approaches in to identify biomarkers for classify the disease we have um here at u of m uh since 2014 and 15 initially funded by some pilot projects uh from foundations and from mishar too and from the early stages of our funding because we are now funded for year six to ten of this project we developed a protocol to improve the quality of the images that we acquired they are condemned ct images they are not as high resolution as the c the ct scans that you take in the medical [Music] field but they are better qualities than we started with in 2013 and 14 as well as added a very detailed protocol for acquiring biological symbols uh from blood and saliva and a standardized protocol for clinical exams and surveys as part of all of the patient demographic information all of this data is stored in um web-based data managed system that our research team has developed that is called dsci daily storage for computation and integration and this is just the login page of our dsci that is responsible for uh not just storing but computing different tasks and cavens group has already developed a couple of tools that have been implemented in this web system uh for different centers in the u.s not just for michigan and the goal of the different tasks do us to model not just the imaging data but the biological and the clinical data too as well as um here just saying it run the quantitative data that what is computed from the saliva in the plasma the very detailed information from the clinical evaluation pain variables of mouth opening and demographics and from the cbcts we now not just utilize the 3d surface but also quantitative radiomics in both bone morphometry the first work that we did with vreza was to do some image processing to extract uh the bone features added to our previous work on 3d shape analysis and we have had identified initially 17 biomarkers that were expressed in tmj uh oa patients that were cytokines chemokines kinds growth factors and neurotransmitters as well as apoptotic uh regulators and enzymes and correlation factors in blood and in synovial fluid we have since then stopped collecting synovial food because it's more invasive for these very small joints but have demonstrated that these proteins are also expressed in systemic fluids such as saliva in plasma and this is the work uh that was published in 2019 then looking at the detailed information of how the texture of the bone the quantitative information um changes in the disease compared to the control patients um these are some of the cbct large field of views that are acquired uh regularly for most of our surgical patients and this is the protocol that we have been utilizing uh when i talk to kayvon i say these are high resolution images and kevin says wow these images are so noisy these are bad skins don't you have anything better and i said no we don't have the money or look we can't irradiate the patients because ct scan is a lot more radiation those for the patients these are low dose imaging systems that were originally developed for radiation therapy but they are a lot less cost for the patients too from then we have moved to analyze uh this data we have implemented some machine learning approaches uh to analyze the data that we have collected prospectively some of these machine learning approaches have not yet been implemented in our web system but we will be continuing to work with our uh research team towards implementing different machine learning approaches into the web system including in the supplement um that we just got we are fortunate to have reza working with a postdoctoral fellow in kavan's lab emmanuel zappala on adding privileged information uh in machine learning approaches to disease classification and prediction of disease progression this is our um work that in fact now it's not in it's not under review anymore it has been published in scientific reports now in 2020 where of the two machine learning deep learning approaches utilized were extreme boost in light gbm uh first um our statistical expert from unc utilized a general association analysis of risk factors to select not only biomarkers but interactions between of the myomarkers that would properly classify the disease condition and we have moved in from there to compare because all of the image analysis require quite some image processing we have been working with uh reza to combine active deep learning and active contour modeling the tool for automatic segmentation of the condyles has already been implemented in our web system and clinicians um such as our phd students in the lab nigel are being able to utilize um these two to actually segment automatically all of the follow-up condyles because until the beginning of this year we had analyzed only our baseline data sets but we are now collecting two to three year follow-up for changes in assessment of changes in long-term um and in the methods also developed in kavan's lab reza is working with emmanuel to apply game theory for feature selection and compare this with some of the other methods published in the literature and that our group had already implemented so we are very fortunate to have added new steps in our original proposal thanks with this very exciting new collaborations with the michigan institute for data science that has made a big difference for us and of course the goal is that once these models are deployed uh and provide new insight into this condition uh a new decision-making support uh our studies are observational they are not any intervention but we hope that this will give us targets for future treatment personalization in identifying the biomarkers we have up to now as i said utilize mainly as procedures like gbm and xg boost um emmanuel is working with res in both svm and svm plus utilizing privileged information to see the performance of those approaches and we had discussed with kayvan also utilizing the long term for the follow-up assessments known convex kernel learning and will follow their guidance so with our go to improving decision making for the tmj us osteoarthritis diagnosis and this is just a diagram and i'm not going to go into detail because it's too much information of our predictive model of thj oa projection uh progression as we are also collecting two-year follow-up data the baseline visit we acquired both imaging clinical and biological markers and these are some example of surrogate markers in our preliminary studies and we are now collecting the longitudinal data that we have not analyzed yet so we're very excited to continue this work that's the part of our work that has been funded we i think have been very fortunate to have gotten um foundation support nih support that's just one r1 but our recent work uh we are actually gathering some ideas and um towards what we call a patient specific classification of dental root canal and crown shape uh we're aiming to get this ready for a submission for march uh in this new initiative on decision support and systems systems in dentistry uh and the idea is that i and most of you have probably seen in your instagram your do it yourself uh aligners you can print you send them just a picture that you take on your uh cell phone and they move your teeth with the liners but those are based um just either on reconstructions from only the crowns with no information of where the roots of the teeth are so this is in a specific application in the field of orthodontics but the importance of integrating information from the crowns with the root canals it extends to many different areas in dentistry such as endodontics in plant dentistry uh restorative because the crown of the shape needs to match of where the root is and so this requires combining different imaging modalities informations that include low contrast or very narrows in tortuous root canals with the greater anatomic detail um of the crown morphology obtained by intraoral scanners and here just the we're clipping the gums here because our goal is to have the whole tooth information from the digital intro aro and we have done some preliminary work for registration of the information from the volumetric images to the surface scanner images our preliminary work with kavan's group and reza leading this work has utilized first image pre-processing for automatic segmentation of the root canal then um deep learning with unet uh and this work actually is a summary of it was accepted for presentation of the shape my workshop in the beginning of october it's a mikai workshop and uh then in the end we do need to do a little bit of image post processing uh so this code was developed by one of our previous uh french interns that worked on the reza supervision and we're looking forward to having new interns with all of the their ds 2019's were just approved so they will be here in the beginning of october to hopefully implement the code for this work also in our web system for clinical applications and we have integrated this work that reza did with our collaborators in computer sciences at unc that implemented the tool for automatic segmentation of the dental crowns from those surface scanners that are very easily acquired in private practice now and all patients take digital scanners that utilize some projection plans to probe the digital model surface and extract associated shape features that separates the gums and the teeth and this is the architecture of the run at neural network that our colleague from unc has implemented this part of the pipeline of the of these two has already been deployed in the web system but will require further uh refinements in pre-processing post-processing steps as well as identification of each tooth separately and merging to the root canal information uh a summary of our results in this um in the cbct images this is a manual segmentation by experts even if it's time consuming clinical experts with any of the tools that we use for segmentation often miss the epical portion of the root canal this is a rendering of the manual segmentation the segmentation with using only image processing and here combining image processing and um deep learning approaches uh in the tool that reza has developed recently with the french intern doc mr maxime dumont that you some of you and kavan's lab must have inter may have interacted with are preliminary results in terms of testing area under the curve sensitivity and specificity and the segmentation of the crowns and identification of individual tooth morphology with the respective confusion matrix uh to detect um the accuracy of this position the ultimate goal of this pilot studies is then to combine information of different modalities towards determining uh the position of the root inside the bone and this will hopefully lead to avoiding undesirable uh tooth movement or undesignment placement of implants inside the bone as well as guide tools for endodontic treatment um and in just a diagram here of why this is relevant up to now we have had from the digital scanners just information from the crown and because of the quality of these images is very hard to see where the root canals are but of course we can't forget uh that these teeth are inside bones with very little bone coverage so the precision of the treatment needs to be taken into account otherwise as a result of for example tooth movement with aligners the roots of the teeth can be thrown out of the bone uh with um tooth loss in the long term because of inadequate position our work has only been possible because of the truly interdisciplinary nature of the work um these are some of the people from the dental school and some of the people that you recognize in in your own department and we have been very fortunate to get have had some mentoring of dr roman and dr athey for which we are very grateful for i don't know if i sped up and talked too fast but that's what i had prepared to share with you this afternoon thank you so much for listening and i'm ready to hear feedback and comments for the challenges that we have to face ahead thank you lucia so it was i think it's it's uh sort of a record of fitting so many different systems a schematic diagram results in in a presentation in in in in half an hour that was like a breakthrough so so thank you very much lucia so any any questions for lucia if if you have a question please activate your uh uh unmute yourself and ask the question yeah lucio that was great thank you so much i'm glad to see all the progress um you know i was just curious about the timeline on the um on the uh bone pathology and the tmj you showed that slide where you had the normal ones and then kind of the ones that were progressing and then the ones that were you know really kind of stuffed out you know how long does that take or that just vary with the severity of it and is there any kind of uh you know kind of any any uh any kind of uh deeper understanding that from your experience that you've been able to get in terms of you know and then and then also when it ha you know do you get the lock jaw and stuff when when those bones kind of uh deteriorate like that does that make it just get keep getting worse i was actually trying to go back and right now i don't know if you guys can see that my computer is frozen oh no can you see the little thing twisting here that my computer is frozen or you can't see that in the video recording no we can't see that it looks fine to us we see the cursor movement i stopped sharing but yeah it's my powerpoint that is frozen i stopped sharing for a little bit oh but now my powerpoint is frozen can you can still see me right because yeah we can see yeah buddy so try stop and then try sharing again that's what i do well i can't because once i i clicked on stop sharing it went back to my powerpoint screen and my powerpoint screen is frozen and i can't anything you can just ask answer in words yes um with regard to disease progression it is true that some patients have a lot faster progression and this is one of the reasons that we are looking at such um detailed markers both at imaging level biological level and clinical level because we do not know the answer why some patients have such more rapid bone destruction while others will go decades without having marked bone loss but there are the patients with acute stages of the condition where they have the joint that is mainly completely flattened and resorbed in about one to two years so in our estimated follow-up of two years we actually have a couple of very interesting cases that have already come back where the joint was joint was completely remodeled during the observation period oh wow yeah so all patients actually had uh some only conservative approach we did uh we were and we know that there is a retention rate when you're doing any absurd longitudinal observation study that some of the patients didn't return because they actually had surgery done during the observation treatment which is a confounding factor because maybe some of the more severe patients we actually lost them because they decided to be treated surgically during the follow-up period but even then uh we're documenting the patients who sought surgical intervention during the treatment as well with the patients that had rapid disease progression the challenge with that and um as a follow-up as i mentioned we are fortunate to be funded for years six to ten and it was the work uh that kayvon and the feedback that gil and you brian did that allow us to renew this um project for five more years so we're this would not have happened without your input but um moving forward um our goal was also for the tmj project to develop um uo one uh with different clinical centers and we have started i didn't add that information in this presentation we have started some preliminary work well with the oregon health sciences because they have recently gotten an r1 on longitudinal uh changes of the tmj but their data it has been you know so hard to work with because it's like the large field of view scans that have very poor image quality image quality they also had they have both cbct and they have mris but their mris were not acquired with a three-dimensional imaging protocol we see all of the mris in the medical field even mri elastography that even detects the muscles and so on but those are very high quality images that are usually not taken for the tmj the mris of the tmj's are taken with very thick slices that do not make 3d reconstructions possible and doing the multa modality muda modality integration uh has been a challenge for the in the data that we have gotten from different centers so those are challenges for the future um how do we integrate um data's from different quality of imaging because for these approaches to be successful and really implement deep learning approaches we need large number of data but every large data set that i have looked at really suffers from the quality of the data set from the standardization of the protocol in which the data were acquired so i have a question for you yes i'd like to know the extent to which your phd colleagues and dental colleagues uh besides participating and appreciating the analyses from caveman's team and from you yourself extent which they are learning and how is that coming along i i don't know if you were cut just for me we didn't hear part of that yeah repeat like the last half you are you there yeah i'm here is this better yeah we could do we just didn't hear you sorry i was asked asking about your phd colleagues or trainees and your dental colleagues and trainees whether they are contributing data and doing your analyses or whether they're also interested and capable of learning to do machine learning so that they actually can take over some of these projects and not just be dependent upon k van and you no yeah so the goal of the web system that um i shared briefly is to have the tools as clinician friendly and as automated as possible so that clinician can apply these tools that's that's our goal um we don't have a large number of users outside of our group at u of m now but we are training people with that regard and how to use the web system and it's it it's still in the development stages uh juan carlos creator our collaborator at unc is the one who helped us with the implementation of the web system but just for you to have an idea there are many initiatives outside of our group um and there are two different major journals in my field that are doing special issues only on machine learning applications to dentistry yeah okay well that's a little different from my question yeah you know are the tools readily available for the clinicians to use and to apply is that your question right no i understand you're setting it up so they can apply without understanding anything about how it works but i'm curious whether any of them are trying to learn how actually to create machine learning algorithms and to make assessments of there are modifications of them now are they trying to get behind the uh our the setup that you've already prepared for them just to be users yeah i would think that clinicians can only be users honestly um because that's what that's what we say about other fields too but it's not true it's just that not most of them or have the interest or the background to do the laboratory work or the mathematical modeling or such but that doesn't mean that a few of them might not have the capability to actually learn if given the encouragement that's why i'm asking yeah even myself i could not do the work without the developers that i work with um i do not have enough understanding of the mathematical approaches or the programming approaches that it takes um and we were very fortunate to have a post-doctoral fellow with us for two years that led some of the work that we have done in here what is now being recruited as a faculty at the university of pacific that we hope to be continue to be one of the centers that we collaborate with but even somebody with jonas that figure out some of the statistical approaches he doesn't have the understanding to actually implement the machine learning approaches and from what i and k von can please correct me or i don't know if reza or emmanuel had a chance to join this uh presentation but for each application it requires so much programming like the machine learning approaches are not generalizable for example if we have one of the biggest issues that i was describing is that the machine learning approach for segment it works very well for segmenting the condyles but when we started using images from different centers it was much harder to make the machine learning the deep learning approaches even combined with image processing to work properly and that's a tool that resi still needs to develop further with our next programmer that will join this programmer with co worked through kovid remotely until the end of june but after he left we haven't made any progress on the code for automatic segmentation of images from different um clinical centers so um and if res are you here with us i didn't i didn't see him okay so yeah uh kevin maybe you can talk with that regard but for example the post-doctoral fellow emmanuel who's working with reza to implementing privilege information in machine learning approach he's currently working only with svm and svn plus and reza tells me that it will take him a couple of months to be able to test other machine learning approaches even at a postdoctoral fellow level of expertise in your field so that this is why i'm saying i don't think that clinicians lack the interest uh but at least in the field of dentistry they are looking for algorithms that can be applied for the actual problems in dentistry and applied in a clinician-friendly way um maybe clinicians are too dumb to understand how we do but uh from my understanding on this and kevin please correct me if i'm wrong the the machine learning approaches are not generalizable for different applications or different types of images and they need to be carefully um it takes quite some time and work to develop the proper algorithms do you want to add to that kevin so maybe maybe uh gil i think you're asking a very good question and i would say the actual the compromise the street spot between like you know clinicians sitting and writing the code and you know testing machine learning algorithms versus the part that they they only have people who are doing that and they stay aside the sweet spot for that is somewhere in the middle and my desk has actually started one of the programs that we just started with midas is the data science training programs for for clinicians so this program it has like you know a workshop that we talk to people but then it has like a one week of boot camp that we bring clinicians who may not have any background in in computational sciences and what we cover them we introduce different types of machine learning algorithm and some mathematical background that they need to understand what machine learning is doing right and that would enable enable the clinicians to understand all the machine learning the general concept and participating in the decision making as to what algorithm to be used and how to test it so that's a different different thing that clinicians we teach them some uh some programming but we go over major uh methodologies and learning helping them be more uh on top of the problem again in the end we are telling the clinicians that it doesn't it this training does not give you the ability to necessarily sit and code your own algorithm or design the mathematics for a new mathematic i understand coding is another level of detail together right but strategizing or even having an intelligent conversation and the school of dentistry gil has been involved in a school of dentistry has a representative in the in the uh curriculum committee that designed the curriculum for for this boot camp and we are recruiting now we have the you know the maybe that might be like a good opportunity to advertise for that guild if if you brian can can advertisers across medical school we want to be and dental school we can bring like clinicians and give them what they need in order to to to be more involved we'll send something we can help with that sure yeah that's good that'd be very good well that's very good thank you thank you you know you can resist uh yeah you can prepare it okay and just show us and you can carry it forward you don't need us to draft something up for you on this subject oh we have the curriculum we have the flyer we're just going to help them send it around yeah yeah we'll i'll send the flyer to you guys soon okay thank you both you know i know you're having some trouble now with the audio but we do have reza on the line now so reza did you i'm glad you showed up so do you have any you know anything you could tell us about you know your work with lucia from the deep learning point of view uh hi everybody sorry for being late so i had another meeting so uh so currently we are working on uh i don't know if lucio mentioned or not on the privileged learning and we're going to use molecular data as a privilege information and we are working on developing a deep learning model that accepts privilege information so currently we have uh spm plus that accepts pure village information but i guess the concept of using privilege information in deep learning is a is a some is something very new and we are working on it yeah so you know i'm involved with cabin on another project with nick so it's got some kind of idea of the privileged information so maybe kevin can say a few words about that just how that works so basically standard machine learning has has primary information that makes a prediction about the output the class the diagnosis so if you have primary information you have a mapping bleep learning that machine learning is a function that maps primary information to the outcome there are cases that besides the the primary information you may may not have access to secondary information let's call it privilege information that may help with the process of decision making but keep in mind we still want to map primary to the outcome but can we in the in the training process can we let this secondary information privilege information help us with the mapping and create a better mapping between primary information and the outcome for that i give the example that reza said so in majority of the cases in in the clinical setting we have the images and based on the images we want to make a decision that like you know a dental problem is there or not like you know tmj has some issues or not but we have only x-ray images it's very unlikely that in clinical setting you will have access to um to molecular data nobody is running any kind of molecular essay at the clinical setting in most cases but in in the research level kind of you know work we have both uh molecular data and and the um and the imaging data so the question is can we use the research data that has all of that and still map imaging data to the outcome but use molecular information as privilege information that help improve the mapping between primary information which is imaging and the outcome that's what reza is working and we're trying to apply privileged information on multiple you know standard and new machine learning what we're doing with brian is we're applying we have applied privilege information to svm we are currently and that is what we are now applying to the application that lucia has presented to us but we are also working on different types of uh regression trees random forests and neural networks and naive bayes models and we're creating the version of privileged learning version of all these standard machine learning together with some of the new machine learning that we have created and lucia was referring to flexible non-convex kernels that we are working on i was really curious about uh you had a couple words on your slides active deep learning and there were some other keywords that were active can you say a little bit about that what does that mean reza you can um you can help us here but basically what we majority of the cases that we have we don't have enough sufficient data to rely on a passive approach to actually train the model right we don't have enough examples with active learning whether it's applied to deep learning or other methods we are at any given point we look at the data that we have and we ask the question what would be the most next most informative example that can help us uh train the model better and in those cases we actively search for such a case and we seek like you know data from patients who have this ability and it help us to have a faster convergence in the in their learning right so most of the active learning whether this is passive learning passive learning the performance goes like that and active learning goes like that with much fewer examples we can achieve the same level of accuracy but reza we are applying that currently to uh different types of machine learning can you give us an update on that if you have results or uh not for the tmj project currently so for the tmj currently we are working on the just incorporating the privilege information to uh to svm and to other networks as you mentioned like uh uh deep learning models and uh neural network models projects yes yeah res i don't know if you used active learning already but how about the work that you did with maxine demon that first utilized uh or even with search for the segmentation of the scans from the different centers and this is what i was mentioning to them until my computer froze and i will need to restart it so i'm using my cell phone to talk because it was causing a lot of vehicle here the work that you did with cerjose and the code still need to be further developed he did utilize first image processing which is active image processing and then he utilized the u-net to train the models for automatic segmentation of the region of the tmj and the mandibular ramus right uh was that not active learning yet yeah so the one that you you are referring to is was using the active contour as a method of image segmentation so we used active contour now i'm talking about the the methods that he hasn't deployed yet not the emerging processing work that has been deployed lucia we we have the mathematics we have worked on the mathematics but based on what reza is telling us we haven't actually yet applied that we use it for other applications active learning but for this application we haven't apparently we haven't yet used it okay well so we have more work to do that's good so any other any other questions for lucio if not i want to thank you again lucia for for the wonderful presentation thank you very much we're not in person we cannot applause the way we want but you get the message you get the idea thank you so much stephen we'll keep working all right thanks made a lot of progress thank you for the feedback and the nice questions and i um and even uh gail your question was a hard one very thought provoking but um i think we need to keep that in mind and see how is it that we're moving forward with these applications in different uh areas in dentistry right yes definitely i'm looking forward maybe many you know two generations or something it takes a long view okay you and i are long gonna be gone before these two generations maybe josh will still be here but i for sure brian and kavan will be too maybe josh and reza will be come on we're not going anywhere lucia forget that doc and jill's gonna be around for another 20 years man come on why not we're going to the longitude we're going to the longitudinal aging seminar [Laughter] all right okay thank you so much thank you very much thanks everybody thanks josh bye lucy
