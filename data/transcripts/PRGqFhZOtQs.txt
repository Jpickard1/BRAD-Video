up here an integrative systems approach to understanding cell type-specific gene regulatory networks and application to macrophages which are very important in the processes of atherosclerosis Stephen welcome to you can everybody hear me okay how about in the back there everything okay great thanks very much for that kind introduction I'm delighted to be here today at the University of Michigan to tell you about my research program which is focused on using integrative computational methods to map gene regulatory networks and on using these networks to uncover molecular transcriptional regulators of pathogenesis the work that I'll be describing today was carried out in the labs of Ilyas mule ovitch and Alan adaran at the Institute for systems biology and at a Seattle biomedical research institute it'll be a five-part seminar I'm going to start by describing at a high level the problem that my research program is addressing and its relevance to biomedicine I'll then describe the computational approach in some detail and then I'll present two applications of this computational approach both in the area of a throw and I'll conclude with just a few slides on some other areas where I've worked and where the long term vision or where the research program is going biology and biomedicine is probably you know well appreciated by everyone here that biology and biomedicine are being transformed by high-throughput measurement technologies this transformation is being fueled by the rapid decrease in the cost of data acquisition which is probably illustrated most powerfully by the the cost of DNA sequencing which has dropped by an astounding four orders of magnitude over the past ten years and this is driving an explosion in the growth of high throughput measurements of such as functional genomic and epigenomic data sets in nearly every mammalian cell type as well as fully sequenced mammalian genomes cataloguing of natural variants and genotype to phenotype studies mmm today I hope to convey in you know if I accomplished one thing in my talk I hope it is to convey my enthusiasm for integrating these types of high-throughput measurements to uncover key drivers of pathogenesis so this this omics revolution has led to several different unbiased approaches to try and gain insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis that I just want to kind of put my work in the context of some of these paradigms the first are genome-wide Association studies which attempt to relate variant to phenotype the second or gene on gene expression profiling studies which attempt to relate transcript or protein to phenotype and the third or expression QTL studies which attempt to relate variants to transcript now each of these paradigms has its own inherent limitations and blind spots and so there's been intense interest in the last 10 years in strategies to integrate findings from each of these paradigms into a combined Network however what the challenge that we're faced with is how to gain insight into causal regulators of pathogenesis and so for that reason my research program is focusing on gene regulation in a specific cellular context so I'll define a gene regulatory network as a molecular interaction network that connects upstream intracellular signaling cascades to the transcription factors that they control to the DNA sis regulatory elements that they bind in order to regulate the expression of downstream genes and control their functions in the cell so I'm focusing my research program on understanding gene regulation first because we can take advantage of what did what remains today arguably the only truly global and unbiased quantitative cellular measurement that also has good dynamic range second the transcriptome second because transcription factors often control many related many downstream genes with related functions and the upstream signaling cascades for transcription factors are thus of significant potential interest from the therapeutic standpoint and most importantly for today's talk because we can take advantage of chromatin structural measurements and epigenomic measurements as well and in humans expression QTL information to improve our ability to map gene regulatory networks but for the moment are the emphasis will be on identifying these sister Aguila toriel iment s-- and the regulators that bind them in our specific cellular context so the classic approach to this is to use cultured primary cells or cultured cell lines and to profile the transcription responses at these cells of interest to a variety or to a variety of cellular perturbations which could be drug treatments or environmental stresses ideally in full-time courses and under the premise that genes that are co-expressed across a variety of time points and conditions likely have regulatory elements upstream regulatory elements in common these genes are clustered and then clusters of genes that are co-expressed are mapped to the genome ik regions flanking their transcription start sites and then these genomic regions are violent bioinformatics analyzed to identify matches to transcription factor binding site sequence patterns that have been compiled from high throughput in vitro or cellular protein DNA binding assays and when we find a binding site sequence pattern such as the high mobility group box pattern shown here whose matches are statistically over-represented within the genomic regions flanking the start sites of this cluster of COEX jeans that is taken as an indication that there may be a functional association between the transcription factor that recognizes this pattern and the pattern of code suppression so the cell type where I have been developing these computational methods and that is a long term interest it's a core area of interest from an application standpoint in my lab is the mammalian macrophage so macrophages are an important cell type in the innate immune system they're there both I have phagocytic function as well as can present antigen they're important for both health and disease so in in help they're vital for host defense against infection they also help to promote wound healing and they're important for maintaining tissue homeostasis but is there also a bit of a double-edged sword because macrophages can't in cases of non resolving inflammation macrophages can contribute to tissue damage they can present Auto antigen and they can drive chronic inflammation a biomedically very relevant context in which macrophages can drive chronic inflammation is in atherosclerosis so afros chlorosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large and medium-sized arteries characterized by lipid rich focal lesions called plaque which preferentially develop at points that elevated shear stress in the vessel walls such as at arterial branch points after sclerosis developed tends to develop silently over a decade and typically the first overt clinical symptoms occur when there is an acute event such as myocardial infarction or stroke macrophages are present at all stages of the disease process from the earliest fatty streaks through advanced complex lesions and where macrophages can contribute to the thinning of the fibrous cap and lesion destabilization with and the resultant plaque rupture enables the formation of thrombus which is what drives these acute clinical events heart attacks and strokes despite the widespread use of statins and anti-immigrant and ace inhibitors in at-risk population heart attacks and strokes are still very frequent in the United States 1.7 million are occur per year and cardiovascular diseases thought to be responsible for approximately one in four deaths in the United States so despite the successes of statins and other drugs that target classic risk factors for cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease remains epidemic in in the adult population and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed so there is significant interest in the macrophage as a potential cellular therapeutic target for atherosclerosis because of its role in lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation in the vessel wall so cholesterol is carried in the blood by lipoprotein particles for example low-density lipoprotein or LDL which is sometimes referred to as the bad cholesterol and LDL particles can become entrapped in the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall where they are susceptible to oxidative modification yielding an ox LDL species or oxidized LDL that macrophages internalized through their scavenger receptors in a largely unregulated fashion and when macrophage internalization of ox LDL outstrips the macrophages ability to metabolize an influx that lipid and cholesterol it leads to a foam cell phenotype so named for the abundant cytosolic lipid droplets that give the macrophage a foamy appearance by light microscopy so this foam cell formation elicits a variety of macrophage responses that are on balanced pro-inflammatory and incite atherosclerosis so I want to understand comprehensively the gene regulatory network that governs these macrophage responses to atherogenic lipoproteins however it must be acknowledged that studying atherosclerosis as well as other chronic inflammatory diseases presents significant challenges so first the disease is very slow to develop so even in even in animal models the experiments are very time-consuming second there is significant intra and Inter lesion heterogeneity most importantly for molecular profiling of inflammatory lesions the cell type composition of the plaque changes during the course of the disease third in humans the risk of cardiovascular disease and in particular coronary artery disease is thought to be controlled by complex genetic interactions and most common risk alleles that have been identified to date have very modest effect sizes in live humans lesions are also relatively difficult to access which complicates human studies and in the most commonly used animal model the mouse lesions are quite small which severely limits the amount of cellular material that can be obtained for molecular studies so it's almost axiomatic that - to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases we're going to need to use a combination of systems high throughput measurements for exam so I've already mentioned the importance of genotype to phenotype studies such as jiwa studies and I'll just touch on that at the end of the talk in our lab we're also using proteomics to characterize protein transcription transcriptional regulatory complexes that regulate cholesterol responsive genes in macrophages I won't say any more about that today and lipid omics is also an important tool to understand the changes in levels of bioactive lipids in macrophages and in the plaque but for the moment I want to focus on what can be learned from a system-wide standpoint using the transcriptome and as I mentioned before in for primer cultured primary cells we can profile responses to a variety of cellular treatments or perturbations treatment with various oxidized lipoproteins etc and gain a fairly fine-grained clustering of genes into co-expressed groups and thus have good statistical power for detecting statistical over-representation of transcription factor binding sites shown in yellow cyan and magenta but this is just this is just a simple model of pathogenic processes in a simple in vitro cellular model ultimately we want to get to a molecular understanding of the changes that occur in vivo and here her cells derive from in front inflammatory lesions so we can typically profile only a comparatively limited number of contents and conditions so we may be able to only stratify genes just based on their ratio with lesion grade or their ratio during lesion progression versus regression and so this is going to limit our statistical power for detecting transcription factor binding site enrichment so we need to improve the accuracy with which we can detect transcription factor binding sites what are the barriers to accomplishing this well the first barrier is that in mammals this regulatory architecture is very sparse and spread out in the genome so while we know that the proximal promoter is important from a gene regulatory standpoint there can be distal regulatory elements that from a one dimensional view of the chromosome can be tens of kilobase upstream but from a 3-dimensional spent standpoint these read these distal elements can directly interact can be proximal to the transcriptional complex and have an important regulatory function however just violin dramatically analyzing all genomic sequence far upstream of the transcription start site to look for matches to binding site sequence patterns leads to an unacceptably high rate of false positive matches that is to say pattern matches that do not correspond to transcription factor binding sites and certainly not to functional regulatory elements and just using phylogenetic conservation information which works so well in simpler eukaryotes to help distinguish regular bonafide regulatory elements from chance matches to finding site sequence patterns it's not gonna this will not solve the problem in by itself enamels as can be easily seen from the fact that there are transcription factor binding site locations that are not broadly conserved across placental mammals shown here here the second barrier is that as was illustrated so well by the the big nature paper from the mouse encode project about eight months ago regulatory elements in mammals tend to be very cell type and tissue specific okay so these authors characterized nineteen different a variety of epigenetic and chromatin marks in nineteen different Mouse tissues and they compiled a tissue specificity index for each of these regulatory marks and to boil down their paper they found a a preponderance of these regulatory elements are highly tissue specific mm-hmm so today it's probably well appreciated that chip seek is an essential tool for decoding the complexity of mammalian gene regulation so I want to just define this assay so that this is chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing based detection okay so this is an assay that can detect the location of a DNA binding target protein or covalently modified protein genome-wide so if for example you do an IP using an antibody directed against a set elated histone or it would produce a numeric track along the chromosome like something looking like this where a peak in this track might correspond to a cluster of a set of nucleosomes where the histone amino-terminal tails are assimilated corresponding to d condensed chromatin so about five years ago anticipating the future importance of chip seek as a tool for understanding mammalian gene regulation i developed a software pipeline or analyzing chip seek data that was specifically adapted for both epigenetic as well as transcription factor chip seek experiments and as a pilot application we used this sought this computational pipeline to analyze data from a combination of five transcription factor chip seek assays that we carried out in primary Mouse macrophages the goal of this pilot study was to look for hotspots where transcription factors are binding in the genome and when we lined up this tract of transcription factor binding signal alongside signal from a chip seek experiment or a set elated histone core we noticed a correspondence between transcription factor binding hotspots and these valleys in the signal or histone acetylation chip c so we devised a computational score representing the depth of these valleys and we sought to use this score in a sequence based framework for detecting transcription factor binding sites we found that indeed if we on if we can augment classical sequence based detection of transcription factor binding sites we can improve the accuracy or detecting these binding sites by 50% so this led me to one a more broadly used at the genomic and genomic data sets to improve our insight into gene regulation so I have systematically aggregated chip seek a variety of datasets for Mouse map for primary Mouse macrophages including 102 transcription factor chip seek datasets which is the buzzword for that is the system spanning 23 different transcription factors 63 epigenomic chip seek datasets spanning 7 different epigenetic marks these are marks that include active actively transcribed regions facultative heterochromatin constitutive heterochromatin and so forth i carried out a DNA seek essay in my lab to map hyper regions of open chromatin and we also obtained DNA seek and fair seek datasets which also give insight into open chromatin from the encode project we also obtained from the Phantom project experimentally determined transcription factor sorry transcription start sites from a deep cage assays and we also carried out pull to chip seek assays in our lab and finally in humans we can use expression qtls so for example there have been multiple studies of expression qtls in human mana and mana sites derived from segregating populations for lipid levels in humans so i want to point out that for these Mouse macrophage datasets about 80% of them came from public sources and only 20% came from our lab so I think this speaks to the potential utility of these approaches in in other cell types in situations where we can leverage these datasets from the mouse encode project and similar data sources data resources so I devised a computational strategy to integrate these various datasets and it's a two-part strategy that I call regulatory element machine learning to infer networks instructing specific cellular expression and it's it's a two-part approach the first is to use a supervised learning algorithm to combine all of these cellular epigenomic and chromatin structural measurements and in humans also the idea would be to combine expression qtls as well to predict the locations of sis regulatory probable sis regulatory elements in genome-wide and then the second part of the approach is for genes that are transcriptionally altered dysregulated in our cellular response of interest for example responsive macrophages to atherogenic lipoproteins we within these regions we carry out a statistical test or over-representation of sequence matches to transcription factor binding site patterns and from that as i'll show we can bootstrap a regulatory network so we're focusing on a cell type-specific gene regulation it's an integrative method that tries to leverage epigenomic as well as chromatin structural information and we're using a model-based approach to identify key regulators and their targets so how does it work we're we're binning the chromosome in 200 base pair intervals and then within each interval we're taking it we're taking advantage of all the sort of cell type generic information that we have access to from annotation of the the relevant genome for example the annotated mouse genome so we have information about we have scores representing conservation biology genetics on servation across placental mammals we have GC percentage information proximity to the nearest CPG Island and so forth so these are all arguably potentially relevant to a predicting whether you're in a regulatory region but very importantly we're leveraging all of these cell type-specific measurements that i've discussed before now anytime you're talking about supervised learning you need to have a training data set that's that's fundamental to when to the the whole enterprise and so here what I did was to combine those 102 transcription factor chip seek datasets so they spend 25 transcription factors - and they're highly they're locations they're binding locations are highly correlated in the genome so they were we're gaining insight into these hotspots where transcription factors bind and using those locations as a set of true positives to train this supervised learning algorithm okay and then we can use it to map probable sis regulatory regions genome-wide so then for genes that are responsive in our cell type of interest and our cellular perturbation of interest we map to again the large genomic regions flanking the transcription start sites but here we use that supervised learning algorithm that I mentioned to map probable regulatory regions and then we bioinformatics the sequence within these regions to look for transcription factor binding site sequence pattern matches when we find one we can map to its putative target genes and if we do this for all of the transcription factor binding sites sequence patterns we can gain a compendium of sis regulatory element a compendium of sis regulatory elements that are potentially functionally associated with our cellular response we can map to their downstream targets their putative downstream targets as well as their transcription factors that recognize those sis regulatory elements and their upstream signaling cascades through molecular interaction data databases so this is kind of how the data look when you've organized them along the chromosome so I just want to point out here that importantly in a given 100 base pair interval which is about this distance we're not just taking to account whether you overlap a given epigenomic feature but we're also taking into account proximity to the nearest feature of each type okay so you may not directly overlap a histone acetyltransferase to choose from and so I tried three of them in this pilot study to integrate these largely continuous valued feature features to try and predict the locations of these transcription factor binding hotspots genome wide and the three that I tested were adaptive boost the support vector machine and a random forest model and in terms of prediction performance measured by the curve the trade the curve representing the trade-off between sensitivity and type 1 error so the greater the closer the curve gets to the upper left corner the better a job the model is doing the random force was the highest-performing and it was also by far the fastest okay so this was some pretty much a no-brainer I'm using random forests and it is an ensemble classifier that can account it can take advantage of both continuous as well as categorical features categorical means discrete and it it you're basically training and ensemble of decision trees and each decision tree is based on a different subset of the features and at a given in a given hundred base pair interval then each decision tree votes on where that interval does or does not coincide with a regulatory element and so the fraction of trees that vote yes has a nice probabilistic interpretation which is very convenient for incorporating into statistical Network inference downstream so this is how the voting fraction might look if you threshold it it at 1/2 along the chromosome and not suprise okay so the the salmon colored boxes represent cell type generic information so CPG Island proximity GC content phylogenetic conservation that and the like and the the baby blue blocks represent the cell type-specific information that we've integrated into the this supervised learning algorithm and then the voting fraction scores in each hundred base pair interval thresholded it at 1/2 which is why you don't see anything below half here are are displayed along here so naturally one it's it's an only natural I think you know I was curious so that's just one of the features that I incorporate so this is you know I heard to me that your distance along the chromosome might potentially be connect because if you know if you're far out on towards the telomere versus internal to the chromosome might be relevance because we you know in terms of correlation with heterochromatin that it occurred to me that that might be an informative feature for the machine learning algorithm so oh that so that's just taking the whole chromosome and then scaling it between zero and one so it's just a nice so I you know that's not something that I tested the so the normalized distance along the chromosome I don't believe was a was it didn't turn out to be a particularly strong feature but the actual physical distance in Megabass along the chromosome I you know I didn't I didn't include but you know because of the significant differences in in absolute lengths of the chromosomes my worry was that you know decision tree you you trained on data from one set of chromosomes might not generalize to another as well but yeah I'm testing it so okay so to boil this down so it's only natural to one asked well what subsets of features were actually useful right so we've combined nineteen features and so again the closer the curve gets to the upper left corner the better the better job it those combination of features do and so all nineteen features did the best and a random model which this is literally randomly guessing whether had any given bin is coincides for the binding hotspot of course does very poorly and you see you know a little bit of an improvement if you take into account proximity to the transcription start site but it's not until you get into including cell type specific measurements shown in purple and blue that you're really getting a significant bump in performance so that's also more clearly illustrated if you use a measure of feature importance called the Gini index so the longer the bar is the more important that feature is in discriminating between the true positive and true negative excuse me and so first of all I want to show you that the preponderance of blue bars up top is you know showing that the cell type-specific information really is essential to the performance of the classifier with the exception of the chromosome that you're on actually turned out to be important so that was kind of curious and and we can talk about that after the after the talk if there's interest so then the the next the next thing that one notices is that the hashed bars which are the histone acetylation also were all clustered towards the top so this is consistent with our previous work establishing that histone acetylation of derived features are particularly beneficial in mapping transcriptional transcription factor binding sites so and then i just want to emphasize that we're not just predicting that you should look only within 500 base pairs of the transcription start site that would be sort of disappointing since the whole goal was to do a better job by being able to go further out and so indeed close to 20% of the predicted regulatory elements are more than 2 KB from the transcription start site and in the interest of time I'll just say that we mask low complexity repeats we scan for motif matches within all non-coding sequence in these predicted regions and would for this pilot study I used a tandem statistical test but to test for over-representation of binding site sequence pattern matches but where I want us to go is a Bayesian approach to identify statistically over-represented binding sites sequence patterns and so we can talk about that perhaps after the talk if there's a lot of interest the idea is to take into account the voting fraction from the supervised learning algorithm without having to threshold it so I don't need to apply I wouldn't need to apply a hard threshold and also to take into account uncertainty in the sequence pattern for the transcription factor probably well appreciated by many of you that these transcription factor binding sites sequence patterns that have been compiled differ widely in how their degree of uncertainty in their composition yes oh you mean in the list of sorry let me back up a step so the supervised learning algorithm is not using transcription factor binding site but in the statistical test for over-representation at yes absolutely that's a really important distinction we can talk about why I'm yeah I have some ideas about why why it's best to split them up that way but it's a very important sort of separation of information in the method so I have several ideas about where I would like this to go but most notably incorporating 3d chromatin information when the resolution gets to where I would like it to be [Music] you know if the resolution was sub kilobase I can sort of directly envision how I would pull that information into this computational approach and and how and foresee how it would directly benefit the framework at 40 KB resolution I'd have to have to spend some time thinking about how to do it okay so this now I want to very briefly talk about two applications so I've presented the computational approach in it described how it integrates all of these various measurements so now I would like to very briefly talk about an application of this approach to understand the gene transcriptional changes in macrophages that have been treated with Afro genic lipoproteins so this work was done in collaboration with my colleague in the adaran lab who is also a cardiologist at Virginia Mason Medical Center and Liz gold so my initial goal was to uncover the transcriptional changes in macrophages in response to a thorough genic lipoproteins so isolated peritoneal macrophages from black 6 mice incubated them with ox LD yet with a high concentration of oxide yell and they very clearly become bone cells as can be seen by staining with the lysa chrome dial red Oh as well as with the lipophilic floor for Bo dippy 493 503 and based on the literature there was some transcription factors that I expected to see that would be whose binding sites would be over-represented for the genes that are up or down in response to ox LDL so these I had a list of ones that I expected to see coming out of the method but my hypothesis was that using this chromatin guided approach we would see a lot more and but first we need is to do the transcriptome profiling and so I carried out excellent exon or a transcriptome profiling of these peritoneal macrophages and I did some qPCR just to validate that the hybridization based measurements are faithfully recapitulating the transcript levels as they would be taking qPCR as a gold standard and they they are so then I used this chromatin guided transcription factor binding site analysis method that I described mmm to see what transcription factors binding site sequence patterns I could detect and you always want to have a control right so as a method as a sort of control method I used a sort of naive or classic approach just look at all non-coding sequence within one kilobase of the start site and with or within five kilobases of the start site okay so that's kind of a control and the bar length represents the enrichment ratio and the number of binding sites versus what would be expected by chance for a randomly selected group of genes that are expressed in peritoneal macrophages okay so that's why we're not trying to what the intention is not to detect a transcription factor that is just associated with a macrophage being a macrophage but instead to detect transcription factors that are associated with the group of genes that are up or down in response to ops LDL and so the white bars are the ones detected using the chromatin guided approach and it's easy to see we detect a lot more transcription factors and in every case we have a stronger enrichment ratio if we use the chromatin guided approach that was also the case for genes that were down in response to oxy LDL and the transcription factors that we expected to see based on the literature we we detected so that was also gratifying and another transcription factor family this HMG box binding transcription factor family also was caught our attention for reasons that I'll get to later in the talk so I just want to mention this TCF LEF transcription factor family so the transcription factors that bind these regulatory element patterns are highly connected in the protein interactome not surprisingly many of them complex together and one of the transcription factors that's highly connected in this network and caught our attention because we had done some previous work on it is the stress response of transcription factor atf 3 and it is itself moderately transcriptionally induced in response to ox LVL we also have known from previous work in our lab that ATF 3 is negatively regulates expression of PLR inducible that is to say toll-like receptor inducible pro-inflammatory cytokines so toll-like receptors are a conserved superfamily of membrane bound receptors that detect microbial molecular components so they're a part of the microbial sensing machinery that macrophages and other cells possess and so atf 3 is an obligate repressor that when in a TL are stimulated macrophage will help tamp down expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines so we wondered whether it played also plays a role in regulating macrophage foam cell formation because of the previous results that I showed you and so isolated macrophages from wild-type and atf 3 deficient mice and incubated them with ox LDL and indeed at every concentration of oxygen sorry at every concentration of oxalá that we tested there was a significantly greater amount of neutral lipids and lipid droplets in the knockout macrophages compared to wild-type control cells so we also validated this using an enzymatic assay for cholesterol esters that I worked out in the lab and we also validated this finding by mass spec by mass spec based lipid omics for neutral lipids so these cells there seems to be increased foam cell formation in when atf 3 is knocked out we wondered whether that was also the case in vivo and so we used the Apryl lipoprotein eid efficient mouse as a model of diet induced hypercholesterolemia and indeed the double knockout peritoneal macrophages from the double knockout mouse also have more lipid droplets than the age and sex match control animals so HTF 3 seems to be a negative regulator of foam cell formation so we wondered about its effect on atherosclerosis so we again turn to the april enoch out mouse which in addition to being a model of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia is also a model of atherosclerosis in the mouse and so we cross to the april enoch out mouse with the atf three knockout mouse and we weaned age and sex matched cohorts of single knockout and double knockout animals onto high-fat diet for eight weeks and at this early stage of the disease process we found an increased lesion area at the aortic sinus in the double knockout as compared to the agent sex match control animals so at least at this early stage of the disease process loss of atf three exacerbated a pro sclerosis at the Uralic root and we using systems approaches which i don't have much time to describe today we think we have a pretty good handle on the mechanism so using transcriptome profiling i should say that we we tried all of the obvious explanations looking at plasma lipids serum cytokine levels and found nothing that could trivially explain this phenotype and so that is why we turn to transcriptome profiling in nouse macrophages to try and see get a handle on the mechanism and we found that the most strongly up regulated transcript in the knockout versus wild-type macrophages encodes the enzyme cholesterol 25 hydroxylase so and this is an enzyme who that whose substrate is cholesterol and that pin converts cholesterol into 25 hydroxy cholesterol 25 hydroxy cholesterol based on work going back to brown and goldstein in the 70s and 80s is known to promote cholesterol esterification this is what led us to suspect that it might play a role in our atherosclerosis phenotype and in the interest of time i just want to skip forward so we we think we understand the mechanism by which this enzyme this cholesterol 25 hydroxylase gene is dis regulated in the knockout it's due to atf 3 directly binding the promoter of CH 25 h and changing histone acetyltransferase e2b to detect 25 hydroxy cholesterol in lipid extracts from macrophages macrophage condition media as well as in from now say orta's and in every case we detected that loss of atf 3 leads to a significantly increased level of this oxy sterile and we found that if you incubate macrophages just wild-type macrophages with if you supplement if you if you put 25 hydroxy cholesterol into the growth medium it also promotes cholesterol ester formation and lipid droplet formation so CH 20 + 25 hydroxy cholesterol seems to promote foam cell formation and we did the reciprocal experiment using the CH 25 H knockout so we think 25 hydroxy cholesterol is a driver of lipid droplet formation and we're doing the ongoing studies to demonstrate is in fact the mediator of the atherosclerosis phenotype that we have detected in this ATF 3 knockout animal so I've just a minute or so to mention that we're also working on another systems biology collaboration that uses these computational methods with Ed Fischer at NYU and also with Liz gold and here the goal is to understand the transcriptional changes that occur in macrophages in regressing fo schematic lesions and so in them unlike in humans in mouse there are various manipulations that can that can readily trigger regression of advanced atherosclerosis that macrophages emigrate from the plaque so we want to understand from a gene regulatory standpoint what the triggers might be that caused this egress from the black so you we have two different models that were that we're studying and you know I don't have time to go into all of the details today but I just want to empty sighs that we using our chromatin guided analysis for transcription factors we detected this TCF left transcription factor as over-represented among genes that are upregulated in plaque macrophages in regressing versus progressing lesions so why is that important well this this transcription factor family is downstream of the wind of the wind beta-catenin pathway okay which is well known to be to control among other things cell motility and so this led us to hypothesize that beta catenin levels might be upregulated in macrophages in the plaque in regressing lesions so I just want to jump ahead to that to show that we did a pilot study with Collett with this was a postdoc in the Fisher lab julia van brennick did the immunohistochemistry we found that there isn't at least in this pilot experiment we found increased levels of beta catenin in macrophages in the plaque in regressing versus progressing animals and so at least in this pilot experiment in this one model of plaque regression we're seeing a nice validation of a prediction that came out of the integrated computational analysis and so now we're gonna look at wint inhibitors and you can imagine what might come next for that so and I'm gonna skip ahead because we're running out of time and I want to tell you about where I think the research program is going so this is this is the last slide before the acknowledgement so on the long term vision for where I've talked a lot about mapping gene regulatory networks and some of the experimental work to try and understand the function of transcription factors in these networks but from my standpoint the network is really not the end goal but rather a means to gain a better understanding to identify candidate drivers of pathogenesis and candidate disease genes or biomarkers so the long term vision for where I I hope to take my research program is a second emphasis that complements the part of the program that emphasizes mapping regulatory networks the second part of the program would be emphasize on using these would be focused on using these networks to identify candidate disease genes taking most importantly taking to account what we know from genetic Association studies and the full protein interactome and so forth and so hopefully I'll get a chance to talk with some of you about that at length so I want to thank my collaborators especially the Fisher lab and my mentors Alan Adair and Ilya Semyonovich I also want to thank Liz Gould who's Mike then my long-term collaborator at on this atherosclerosis work and our technician arena Podolski and finally I want to thank my funding source on particular the NHLBI thank you very much for your time so if you were going to is there a hierarchy of what data is actually most useful because a guy like me who can't generate a lot of this data de novo I get you can I get most of this information just by pulling it off from from publicly available sources so I'm happily unhappy to bravely you know speculate based on what I've seen from macrophages you know to other context but with the caveat that what I'm about to say is based on my observations from measurements in mouse macrophages but histone acetylation is clearly the one you know measurement I would start with dnase hypersensitive sites also are important you know if I had to make two sets of chromatin and epigenomic measurements those would be the ones that I would start with which is not to say that others won't prove to be important when they've become you know when coverage levels improve and when we get you know some of these data sets get deeper but that's that that would be my starting point if I were to take this into a cell type or context where I had not used it before you had those bar graphs comparing your methods that oxy LDL enriched up and down regulated genes lots of those things were just blanks in the sense that you got you know the blank bar for your method and nothing in the other method is that because the other methods aren't searching for it or just because they're you know completely ineffective compared to what you are doing and what you know so it in the if mostly it's because any other methods we were below the statistical significance threshold or detecting and in an over-representation of the transcription factor of that those transcription factor binding sites so now you know ultimately the real proof is and you take you know the real proof of the discovery potential of the method is to take transcription factors that come out of the method and validate them you know in vivo as we've done right I mean that's that's the proof that you know convinces me and has me excited but you know that's a long-term process the atf three study was was a four-year study so just in terms of that graph whether there's a you know a fight against a straw man there in the sense that is a certain technique not expected to register anything anyway in other words you never expected them to show up on certain of those things that you're measuring well if you're talking about the comparison to the scanning all non-coding sequence within one KB or five KB of the transcription start site so mean all you know let's say transcription factor X is indeed its binding sites are indeed over-represent over-represented in all of the real regulatory all the bonafide regulatory elements near this group of genes so the question is whether we can detect it so you're gonna see the sequence matches for those all of those sites if you use your five KB plus or minus five KB method the problem is you're gonna see so many other false positives that it's kind of just washed out right because false positives contribute to the numerator and the denominator so I you know I don't know I mean I felt it was important to compare to something on the there are other other possible strategies I think that could be useful for complimentary validation strat you know methods so for example applying it in a simpler model system where we have comprehensive information about from deletion libraries and so forth so in that that's certainly something that would have merit as an as a complementary approach to validate the the method in obviously in aus we can't do that sure I think it might be best to jump out of keynote here and then oh now it is it's buffered all the keyboard input in now okay sorry one second back one now if you zoom in enough and I don't know that I can I don't know that I can do that on this but if you zoom in enough it's no random force definitely outperforms adaptive boost in fact I did a statistical test and there's definitely the this is the area under that blue that blue curve yeah and this purple bar is the area under the purple curve and the blue curve clearly has greater area which it can only do if it is higher than the balloon yeah yeah we have to oh yeah yeah it's about five times faster than adaptive boost you know now again with and and yes and the performance was you know a little bit better whether that but yes it's significantly faster for to Train in terms of correlating the predictions of the machine learning algorithm with sis eqtls and that kind of thing or yeah yeah yeah so I remain very sanguine about the utility of eqtls in the long run for this kind of enterprise but it's more of something that I you know will bear fruit in human than so that there have been to study studies of monocytes human monocyte eqtls that have generated I think 10,000 and 20,000 sis eqtl various respectively and you know I did map those those variant locations over to now it's using lift over just to see if those locations as a feature would have any benefit in the prediction but you know I if they did not they did not seem to have any benefit having said that it's another story whether they would be beneficial if I read it the whole analysis in human so you know that's something that's worth exploring and you know cuz the we definitely see connections between some of the transcriptional regulatory expressed genes that we're seeing and view wast variants for coronary artery disease so I didn't have time to show that but one of the one of the most strongly upregulated transcripts in regressing versus progra in plaque in macrophages in regressing versus progressing plaque is with the the three prime end of that transcript is within 40 base pairs of a variant that has a G wasa significally significant G wass associated to say so association with LDL levels and risk of coronary artery disease and that Association has been replicated in targeted studies independent targeted studies and it's also quite interesting in that it regulates that's P SRC one yet choline serine which coiled-coil one yeah so it also it's very interesting I mean we're definitely looking into it so it is thought to play a role in regulating microtubule polymerization and so one could imagine that that might be connected with macrophage motility but and on the other hand my enthusiasm is tempered by the fact that the effect size of that allele is you know about 1.1 for risk of coronary artery disease so like all the other common variants is small effect size that's row sclerosis formation of progression other than the slide you showed that which was very interesting but it puzzles me apropos what you are saying about plaque regression in in the mouse model and you said that that seems to be associated with migration away of the macrophages that we're stuck under the under the plaque shell whatever you would call it and and yet in your picture in your picture at least I guess for a human model you seem to say at the at the end stage that breaking of that of the plaque shell released this necrotic residue stuck under the the plaque and that was actually the cause of the thrombus and the the serious yeah you know catastrophic events so so how is the mouth letting this stuff out it out from under the out of the shell without causing a terrible whatever so we don't know whether macrophages are you aggressing through the lumen or the adventitia that is not I mean it's controversial and so I I'm not going to take a position on that so they macrophages that have egressed from the plaque have been detected in lymph nodes so we we think we understand at least in at least in one model of regression where those macrophages are ending up but the specific route that they're taking is not it's not entirely clear and also I want to point out that the mouse is not annex you know it's not thought to be a very good model and all of lesion rupture of quack rupture so the the lesions that tend to form in these classic afro susceptible mouse strains tend to be very stable lesions in they even when they're very very advanced they don't tend to rupture so they're the well though yeah so the rabbit is is a as a good model of diet-induced a hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis like the Watanabe rabbits I think to get into plaque rupture it it's pig's butt well then you know you're talking real money to do those experiments but thank you very much good time [Applause]
