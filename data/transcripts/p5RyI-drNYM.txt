and I find useful for their research so there's a sign in sheet going around please sign it if you haven't already and today's speaker is Craig Stevenson and he's going to talk to us about best practices for quantifying allele-specific expression from rnase all right yeah Thank You Marcy for the kind introduction as well as for inviting me to come speak so my research so I'm a bioinformatics graduate student in Tricia Woodcock's laboratory over in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology and so far my research has largely focused on improving our estimation of both total and allele specific gene expression from next-generation sequencing types such as RNA seek largely in the context of studying gene regulation and how this process has evolved differently both within and between species rather than focus on the biology of gene regulation today I'm instead going to focus on what I consider to be some of the best practices for quantifying allele specific expressions from rna-seq so first of all why study gene expression well kind of at its core this represents the biological process of converting and otherwise inert sequence of nucleotides into some functional gene product and the gene product I'd like to highlight today is that a messenger RNA this is a gene product that is transcribed and then could eventually be translated into protein so this kind of provides the the most basic link from a genotype to phenotype as a form of gene expression and the way in which so it's it's actually relatively easy to study individual genes levels of expression but a few years ago there's a what I consider to be a revolutionary technology that was developed along us to study the overall gene expression level of the express genome and that technique was known as Carney's and this technique proceeds usually in the following way we have a particular sample of interest this the model organism a favorite model organism could be any type of sample mrna is typically extracted from the sample it's fractionated and converted into cDNA can't directly sequence RNA we have to convert it to something that we can actually sequence this is submitted to a sensing machine and at the end of this process we're left with millions of millions of short strings of bases and this is really where the bioinformatics allenge comes in what's not so not so much anymore bioinformatics challenge but the the main the main thing that we'd like to discover from these reads is there a genomic origin so one of the first things we might envision doing is aligning these short sequence reads to some sort of reference genome and if we're looking up to have functional annotations for this reference genome as you can see there are different numbers of sequence rates aligning to these different functional annotations and we can use the number of sequence reads aligning to these aligning to these genes such as proxy or that genes level of expression and this sets up a very natural problem okay once we've once we've looked at gene expression in one sample we might envision comparing this across different samples that differ by some sort of condition they could differ by environment really anything you could think of but total gene expression isn't quite the end of the story as we know in diploid organisms a genes total level of expression is a is a result of contribution from both a maternal and a paternal so in this case I'm I'm highlighting for the same example that I just drawn that I just drew out a set of allele specific reads align to the sternum so here the challenge is differentiating our set of reads into each one of these alleles so why why my son be interested in allele specific expression a one such example is we can use we can use the output of a real specific expression as a measure of the strength or the output of a sample so whether or not there could actually be base changes in sis regulatory regions affecting a genes level of expression we can also use differences in a little specific expression between samples that have identical parents that differ only by which parent contributes a particular allele we can use this we can use differences in allele-specific expression between these samples to look for a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting this is an epigenetic phenomenon whereby either the maternal or paternal allele is epigenetically of silence so in this case if we compare these two samples but again different I which parent contributed which allele a blue or red allele we could see that the in fact the paternal allele in this case is being silenced so today I'd like to highlight for you how we can how we can go from this type of framework aligning a lua specific sequence reads to a genome how we can do this accurately to quantify allelic abundance from this type of next-generation sequencing data I'm also going to go through how to create appropriate genomes for mapping allele specific sequence reads and then ending with a test for significant differences in allele-specific expression for this type of data so like the what the problem suggests we really start by aligning our individual sequence reads to our reference genome and when we when we align these reads to our single reference genome what we can actually use our individual or the base content of individual reads overlapping a particular position in our reference genome to look for some alternative allele so in this case for this particular position I they have to supporting reads overlapping this position that shows some alternative base in this case teeth in this framework we must allow for mismatches a to our reference genome to accommodate this alternative allele and usually these type of alignment procedures are done enforcing unique alignment to our reference genome no questions over there yet okay in fact when different colleagues several years ago attempted this procedure they found that when aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome this in fact yielded a relative measurements of allele-specific expression that were biased toward the reference allele so let me lead you through this one of the plots in their paper so here they're showing for a panel of snips between two individuals shown here in red and blue the proportion of the reads matching allele represented by the reference genome in addition in addition to a deviation from this expected distribution shown here in the black dashed line they saw an increase in variation of this distribution as well as a slight shift in favor of calling a proportion of the reference allele a greater than 0.5 so we we really wanted to figure out why this was happening this when this when this word came out it was a little bit unsatisfying that we didn't fully understand the reasons why this might be occurring so in a simulation study I actually simulated a little specific sequence reads and I used one of my favorite model organism that we also use in my lab Drosophila melanogaster and the way in which I did this was I I used the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome and using a using homozygous genotypes from a different line of josepho Melania gasser from what's known as the Drosophila Jeanette I used differences to this reference genome to define some alternative illegal so here I'm showing in blue the reference allele and in red the alternative and again because we're interested in gene expression I'm looting my simulation to a list of annotated exons and then I started by generating all possible allele specific sequence reads from each of these regions and I did this pulse forward and the reverse complement orientation to reflect the fact that RNA C is typically get done in a non strand specific manner and notice i've colored some reads in blue and some reads are in red these colors will appear throughout the top these represent reads that overlap a differentiating site that is a site that we know can differentiate between both of these alleles i've also colored some reads in black these are reads that while they don't contribute to allele specific expression because they don't overlap on these sites the sequence is identical between these two portions state contribute to a genes total level of expression but not allele-specific expression and to really determine the genomic properties of what might be causing the aforementioned bias i have simulated this data without any sequencing errors and this also what you might notice in this setup is that for each differentiating site this sort of a very naturally we we set up this expectation that the allelic abundance from our reference and alternative allele shouldn't back to B so the proportion of the reference allele that we should be able to recover is 50% that'll become important in some of the later parts of the show so when we take this simulated data and attempt to line to our single reference genome allowing a single mismatch I found that there was slightly there was around 50% of these differentiating sites that showed unequal measures of allele-specific expression when I when I in and that's what I'm showing here in his hide if I instead find the distribution of the proportion of the reference allele as die ignorant colleagues did I see that again most of my differentiating sites those show unequal measures of allele-specific expression on fact biased in favor of calling a higher proportion of the reference or we respect right here Craig let me just clear ask a clarifying question in your simulated data you know that it was 50/50 yes okay and so this is purely it's not a result of the simulation but at the aligning it's a result of the aligning yeah and that's and that's a further motivation for why we didn't incorporate errors into into that simulation wait so did you keep just one one allele specific difference this is real genotyping assuming this this is kind of a exactly if you have like four right and that's that's kind of the punchline for what for what I'll show you after this after allowing a single mismatch so what marine said is very correct there could in fact be individual differentiating sites that are closer to one another then the length of a sequence read and I call these neighboring differentiating sites so in this case where I've aligned I don't know that is when I align our align these sequence reads two single reference um allowing one mismatch if there happens to be a read that overlaps two differentiating sites this of course mismatches the reference genome by more than one and so all such reads that overlap more than one different gene site would in fact be removed from analysis they simply wouldn't be able to line to our single reference gene so because of the we hypothesized that increasing the number of mismatches would improve our estimates of allele-specific expression in fact that was their question sorry I'm sorry I mean you could say so so good question maybe I misunderstood so the original analysis you only you only love you meet mathletes right because that's going to still alone don't eat napping goodness but you're letting you meet mappings with the single mismatch right yes so how do you handle cases where you have may like gene families that are somewhat identical to each other that you might need mapping to another wheel that's this is another issue that will come up a little bit later so the issue Ryan's referring to is known as map ability and I'll talk about how that can also have an effect I was independent of mismatches what are you lying and these are seeing lunar period these are single yeah I've left off some kind of I'm just experimental these are there's actually some bias towards how when we do parity mapping which you know how it maps the paradise okay straightforward is really good yeah so these are all single and done that's the original version folks which has a parameter that allows you to change the number of allowed messages cool thanks okay so as expected when we increase the number of mismatches we do see a broad improvement in our in our measures of allele-specific expression so in the case where i've allowed up to three mismatches i see roughly 10% only 10% of the differentiating sites still showed some measure unequal allele-specific expression one thing we also hypothesis it we also hypothesized that as you increase as these densities of differentiating sites increase so might also the bias toward the reference genome said the next step that we took was to stratify our different training sites based on these densities and we wanted to observe how this how this actually affected our measurements of allele-specific expression so I'll I'll guide you through this plot really quickly because I'm going to show several of them so on the y-axis here I'm showing the proportion of the reference allele and again what we expect from the simulation is that this should be balanced at point five we should be able to recover half of the reference allele the other half being the alternative and on the x-axis here I've stratified the differentiating sites based on based on their density so density of 1 in this case indicates an isolated differentiating site one that has no neighbors within the length of the sequence tree and if anyone's interested the length of sequence read here was 36 what what you immediately see is that as the stem density of differentiating sites increases so does this bias toward calling a higher proportion of the reference allele than was simulated again because we've also allowed additional mismatches we want to look at how this also affected differentiating sites when we separate them into the relative densities as you as you might expect for higher densities this also caused an increase in the bias toward preferentially calling the reference allele one thing you'll notice though is that in when allowing a single mismatch two mismatches in three mismatches we have these relatively what should appear as box plots actually appear as lines because the data are so densely populated around 0.5 these are cases where for example allowing three mismatches we've we've allowed an appropriate number of mismatches to accommodate neighboring differentiating sites of up to three and this also holds true for two and one so that explains why in these situations the systematic bias toward either has been removed as an alternative strategy we can use if available we can also use independent alignments of our sequence reads to both maternal and a paternal genome this is actually a strategy used by an allele specific mapper known as allele seek and the way in the way this works is we take each of our sequence reads and independently align them to each of the maternal and paternal genomes and ask for a sequence we did it uniquely aligned to one or the other genome so in this case this read allowing no mismatches because here there's really no need to allow mismatches the two counties in reference allele that's represented by genome the allele specific genome itself so here we would see that this read in fact aligns uniquely to the maternal genome but because of this mismatch would not be mine we use that as evidence that a read is coming from the maternal and similarly reads colored and black are those that lie equally well to both genomes and so again these contribute to genes total level of expression but not allele-specific expression and here I'm also enforcing so when we use this strategy we see that regardless of the density of differentiating sites the systemic bias toward preferentially calling in this case the maternal allele arbitrarily chosen has been removed and the proportion of differentiating sites showing some level of unequal allele-specific expression has been drastically decreased okay so now I actually want to draw your attention to the issue that Ryan was mentioning so even in our best case scenario aligning to a single reference genome allowing three mismatches so in these cases we've allowed an appropriate number of mismatches based on the density that this actually doesn't affect the strategy of aligning to both maternal and paternal genomes we but we still see we still see differentiating sites that show inaccuracy in their recovered measures of allele-specific expression so one thing that we hypothesized could explain this our differences in map ability and that is our ability to uniquely map because that's one of the that's one of the criteria that we're enforcing are differences in our ability to uniquely map these reads to to to a reference genome so here I just want to give you a couple examples of how map ability could be affecting this so in one case I'm showing a gene parallel that's kind of it's related to the example you are highlighting right so in our reference genome we have this gene paralog that has identical sequence information making it impossible to determine using a unique alignment the genomic origin of this read however in this alternative genome because of a couple base changes here between these two parallels we can fully distinguish any reads overlapping these two based differences from this other copy elsewhere in the genome another issue that can affect genome map ability are regions of didn't line up properly that's okay our regions of low sequence complexity so in this case I'm highlighting in the alternative genome a small microsatellite @ga repeat region making it also impossible to determine the exact origin of this particular sequence reading however in the reference you know this this area of low sequence complexity happens to be broken up by some base changes making it possible to determine the genomic origin of this particular read so we then took our differentiating sites from our different methods and classified them as either showing perfect or imperfect map ability to our particular gene so in our single reference genome case where we're allowing a single mismatch for differentiating sites labeled here in white that show perfect map ability we were largely able to recapitulate the simulated level of 0.5 proportion of the reference allele however for differentiating sites showing imperfect map ability here in gray we saw a much more variable distribution in this proportion of the reference allele this was also the case when aligning to a single reference genome allowing 2 & 3 mismatches also not not entirely surprising this was this explained almost all cases of unequal allele-specific expression in our in our strategy where we're aligning to both maternal and paternal genomes so here again I'm separating differentiating sites into those that show perfect map ability to both genomes or those that show imperfect map ability to either genome and as you might get as you might have guessed those showing perfect map ability and we were able to recover almost a hundred percent the simulated level of the protrusion of the reference allele are those showing any level of imperfect map ability those again were much more variable and what I'm what I'm not showing here but was something we also looked at the the direction of this bias was directly related to which genome either the maternal or the paternal genome showed the level in perfect map building if they were both if both genomes showed in perfect map ability then these measurements could appear anywhere however if only say the maternal breakfast you know showed imperfect map ability were more likely to see estimates of the proportion of the maternal wheel in this area or preferentially calling the paternal allele which showed perfect map ability Tuesday and one other question we wanted to answer was after removing differentiating sites either based on their density of differentiating sites or based on any level of imperfect map ability how many would we still be able to measure and we also wanted to look at how many exons retained at least a single one of these differentiating sites so in fact in our for lack of a better phrase worst case scenario a lot aligning to a single reference genome allowing one mismatch we were able to still use slightly less than 50% of the differentiating sites but just over 80% of exons still had at least one differentiating sites that we differentiate in site that we could measure allele-specific expression from and of course in our best case scenario aligning to both reference genomes almost all differentiating sites as well as exons were usable and these small black bars indicate the additional contribution that imperfect map ability made to the proportion of either differentiating sites or exons we were able to measure this also highlights the fact that while map ability is an issue it's actually a relatively small issue compared to that of the density of differentiating sites when aligning to a single reference gene yes map ability issues with 50 based reads do decrease but are still present as you also might expect by increasing the read length I'm also increasing the number of differentiating sites that could possibly fall within the read length so that also increased the bias in the single reference treatment case I also looked at so this was all done within Drosophila melanogaster I also looked at a between species comparison to look at the effects of sequence divergence and that also had a similar effect as increasing the read language those are results of Nationals he's a pretty different stream so the two species that I know this are you so the blossoms like how polymorphic yes some stuffs gone through labs and it's like these these are pretty close these are pretty close but they said but not close enough to preclude being able to quantify a real specific expression close enough where for every genotype I had the corresponding base in the reference no in dolls ok these areas of imperfect math ability you said you've excluded them from this graphic here [Music] only up to this point and these represent had I ignored math ability this is how many I could have measured it is kind of is the imperfect map ability predictable so can you create a mask for this for the imperfect map ability based on a set of rules or criteria yeah so I actually used a program called gem to calculate genome and inputs to that program are the read length and the specified number of mismatches the way it works I'm pretty sure it simply generates all possible reads from the genome and attempts to align them back to engine and for each site I have a measure of how mapable a read stemming from that location of a specified length how malleable that read is zem is the name of Jim okay so what I'd like you to take away from from these results is that the density of differentiating sites increases the bias and measures of allele-specific expression when aligning to a single reference genome and that the preferred method to reduce this bias or in fact eliminate it is to line to both maternal and paternal genomes and that while imperfect map ability has a small effect it's still a measurable effect when aligning to both the maternal and paternal genomes so I'd like to tell you a little bit about how you can create appropriate genomes for this type of for this type of approach so the way in which the way in which I've done this is we actually have we actually take a material and a paternal sample of genomic DNA and align them back to our reference genome I realize what I just told you there's almost in violation of what I what I consider to be a best practice for quantifying allele-specific expression here we're not nearly as concerned with recovering a particular allelic abundance as we are with just getting a good set of competent reads overlapping a particular site that shows some evidence of an alternative way so here the relative allelic abundance doesn't matter nearly as much so is there an advantage to align to say reference the entire reference or transcript or its genomic DNA to the to the whole reference or you know what sorry you can already still okay yes so this is basically to build build a genome but not in a de novo type of way more like a good but I would be afraid of I would be afraid of differences so there's so there is an issue known as RNA editing that I think could give you a lot of false positives and your variant calling so I would be a little bit more hesitant in directly using the RNA seek reads to to call variants I think the superior approach would be genomic DNA samples if sometimes sometimes they're not there was at least one published approach various parties I don't know how widespread these okay I assume it takes day yeah I imagine such an approach is the most successful when at least cross referenced to a list of known variants that have seen but there you're still dependent on there being a a set of known variants which is also not always possible sweets you need to cover I think with a single lane of genomic a single lane of sequencing for genomic gain and we can recover something in the area of 50/50 X for the Drosophila genome yeah yeah so that's not an issue um but you're right for other genomes that might be this might be so in reality this data looks a lot more something like this this represents a snapshot from the Nomex viewer showing individual date pileups of genomic DNA to this reference genome so here I'm showing a maternal sample of genomic DNA this was the paternal sample of genomic DNA and in addition to these gray Peaks which simply represent for an individual site the number of overlapping reads you'll see some Peaks have been colored differently from this from this gray color these represent these represent elevated proportions of some possibly present alternative allele this program is trying to call of course we can't simply look at genome viewers to call our variants we need a more robust approach that not only takes into account the proportion of reads representing an alternative allele but also mapping properties of those reads overlapping this alternative allele so one such approach that I've started using is known as a gatk the genome analysis toolkit and this is a highly customizable sort of work workflow for calling variants from from a set of sequencing data so what i want what i'd like to highlight with with this workflow here is that level of customization which can simultaneously be somewhat of a headache trying to determine what are the best parameters for my particular sample but in a lot of cases if those are tuned well enough it can get really really good results from this variant caller and in the end you either left with sad face that's a good set of variants or sorry a bad set of variants that you probably have to troubleshoot or a smiley face set of variants that you might be able to use in your project and this is this workflow also represents a gatk is best practices for burying a column that's where I stole my telephone so this again this this degree of customization also highlights the sort of stepwise variant calling that gtk goes through and particularly these individual modules that are calling third calling variants or kind of making changes to the data are known as bloggers and they proceed through the data to perform various steps a couple of which I'd like to highlight for you today in particular how the initial set of variants are determined the real novelty of gatk is its implementation of a local indle insertion or deletion realignment a base Quality Score recalibration but this I actually won't go into much more detail on as it requires a set of known variants which is not always possible in every sample this may be one of the that's maybe one of the drawbacks of gatk although they do provide recommendations for working around this issue as well as how our final set of variants are eventually filtered to get the highest quality set hmm so sorry that shows up a little bit grainy so the first step is to identify our set of candidate variants from this type of alignment back to our reference genome so in the case of a single nucleotide variant the the way that a gtk works is actually a bayesian formulation for individual genotypes that is the probability of a particular genotype given this alignment data is proportional to deprive the prior probability of that genotype this alternative genotype and the likelihood of this read data given that particular genotype we can talk afterward about the more specifics of that formulation for whoever's interested it as well as a candidate insertions and deletions I mentioned this is one of the novelties I consider with gtk is its implementation of the din del algorithm which actually does a local realignment of reads surrounding putative insertions and deletions to improve those calls because as you might imagine reads reads that are close to in those can have a higher level of miss matching bases to the reference genome so this is an attempt to correct those mismatches and not have a spurious set of false positive variant calls so once we have a set of a set of variants gatk also provides a set of recommended filters both for snips and in those and rather than about the individual parameters I'll tell you a little bit about what they what these parameters hope to achieve the first of which is a filter for the average read quality of reads showing evidence of the alternative the second is actually using a Fisher's exact test for the detection of strand bias this is an attempt to reduce false positives there's also a filter determining the consistency of a particular variance site with there being two and only two haplotypes also something taken into account is the average mapping quality of reads overlapping a particular variant and finally there's a small penalty for our alternative alleles that occur on the ends of reads so for many Supan sync technologies the ends of reads are slightly more error-prone than the beginnings of reads so variants that are supported by an unusually high proportion of such end reads for lack of their term there is a small penalty associated and finally once we have our set of variants we need a tool to incorporate them back into our reference genome so if we consider this was our original reference genome we input a set of high quality variants this is a file format known as VCF variant call format at the end of or after inputting this information we'd like to be left with a reference genome that has incorporated while single nucleotide variants insertions and deletions this last case I'm highlighting actually in the metadata shows that this happens to be a heterozygous variant so this is something in many of our analyses we would actually choose to mask so instead of incorporating one of these variants randomly we incorporate as this can have drastic effects when using these nomes to quantify allele-specific expression so the takeaway here is that we can align individual parental genomic DNA to our reference genome to call variants we can incorporate those variants into the original reference genome to create maternal and paternal genomes and these are genomes that we can use in kind of the aforementioned strategy to accurately quantify allele-specific expression so finally once we have a set of a set of accurate allele-specific expression calls how do we test for a different significant differences in allele-specific expression well one of the first things that we actually need to do is normalize our read counts and one of the more popular strategies for this normalization is known as the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads transformation well one problem with this technique though is that for a small fraction of genes that are either extremely large or very highly expressed small changes in those genes can have a very drastic effect on more lowly expressed genes so comparing our PKM transformed count data between samples can sometimes be problematic and no statistical frameworks are tailored for looking at differences in total expression not necessarily a real specific expression and I've even a subset of such programs Dec adjara Poisson seek basic and cuffdiff these also along these programs also are dependent on their being on the sample being replicated which also isn't always a possibility so in the absence of a sample being replicated how can we how can we compare you know these counts between samples we actually need to use count statistics because we're using constitutes the sarvair and because of that we need to actually perform what I'm calling down sampling we need to actually take our set of leo specific reads with more counts and actually reduce them to a smaller sample in order to make them a comparable and to equalize the power or culling allele-specific expression between these samples so in this case if we imagine for a particular gene between two samples we actually have evidence of twice the number of allele specific reads in one sample compared to another we can it turns out we can use the hyper geometric distribution to draw any of these reads so and representing the smaller the number of Julio specific reads in the smaller sample we can draw n reads from this sample without replacement and have a much more comparable set of allele specific counts comparing these two samples so is that is that kind of clear how this is working if we had more than two samples we would simply take the smallest sample and down sample all other samples so that songs and the reason this the reason the hyper geometric distribution works well for this is because it's I mean this this is the description of the hyper geometric distribution we have a large set of objects some some of which are counted as successes and we're actually drawing a subset of this larger sample size and the number of successes in that's in that smaller sample represents or follows a hyper geometric distribution so you're saying that you're slowing the weight they have to increase some statistical power that doesn't seem - nor to equalize the power between these two samples as otherwise it's so estimates of allele-specific expression in this sample are our more are more accurate than estimates in this sample just because there are more supporting reads so it makes it direct comparison between these samples a little bit tricky because the power you're disabled and then the sample size should be taken into a conflict that we've come to here being the sample size in the statistical test to measure the potential specific expression rather than throwing away the more the better sample and just throwing away a sample would sort of preclude the sample okay I see what you're doing I didn't know what help with maybe to explain a little bit more your motivation so if your that's a good point if if you're just looking for a little specific expression differences within one sample you actually don't need to use this type of data but sort of if you wanted to compare for a single gene allele-specific expression of differences between samples these would these are not as directly comparable right it's and so the particular test were using here is the binomial exact test and I think because we're limited to using this test for this type of count data I don't think we can take take that into particular variation I can't think of another test or this is the kind of the gold standard for a real specific expression of if you have replicates so you wanted to compare back to say you wanted to compare back to something some sample that was taken a long time ago that also doesn't have replicates you'd have you I think you'd still have to use these based I think about it's it's not a nun easy problem when you do this it becomes an easy problem any easier problem yeah but without doing this type of down sampling I think it's really hard to compare between samples and so the chest we're using is the binomial exact tests we use this for each gene and here that note we assume that our null hypothesis is that the maternal allele account follows a binomial distribution of the total of the allele account with a success probability of drawing a read from that maternal allele appointment and the choice of this being the maternal allele is also arbitrate that's could have equally this could just has usually been the eternal wheel actually just have to harp on this point but if you have lots of sample say a hundred samples right and you have 99 of the large amount of specific data right you have one of them that's got a smaller melody you down sampling all of that that's data we we've never encountered such an extremely situation like that in that case because usually there's always one or two examples in that case it might I hate to say this but maybe you'd consider getting rid of that sample I know you don't want to [Laughter] we haven't encountered anything that's quite that extreme we've never had to say maybe we should actually throw this sample off of that point larger popular you try to make this independent of the fly work you're gonna have places where there may be two occasions so is that going to bias your results as you're so based on based on how the knee a real specific mapping is done because we're also in enforcing unique alignments it's going to be harder to measure expression in those types of genes speaking only because those genes are so similar that you can't tell the difference between reads coming from this particular gene and it's paralog is that right so so maybe it has something in it probably maybe not depending on how far you know back in lineage you went but you might pick up that difference there but you know see a huge allele imbalance in addition to a little specific expression of balance and so I guess I'm just wondering yes I would would that not be captured though in the in the construction of your maternal and paternal genomes and my maternal and paternal genomes those those differences well if you have any message you know big DNA you know it at that point yes but you're just looking at snips and in Dells not so much so I'm just wondering about if you thought about maybe incorporating that kind of information along with the Simpson it was a big we have a duplications of these in the journal which are all say at these locations and so we expect an allele imbalance and therefore some sort of it'll be a specific expression about yes so so far I would say I haven't taken enough care about those types of structural variants I had asked okay okay it's gonna change you a little frequency to okay so just to wrap things up I hope I've convinced you that aligning symmetries to both maternal paternal genomes can give us the most accurate measures of allele-specific expression and we can construct these genomes by calling variants from separately aligned genomic parental genomic DNA to a reference genome and then using down sampling and exact tests or account data are ways we can determine significant differential allele-specific expression in the absence of replicates so with that I'd like to thank my advisor Tricia wit comp as well as a postdoctoral researcher now turned research scientists in the lab Joe Coulomb as well as the rest of the and thank you all for some difference of proportion yeah nine of them all implemented in our so you can use any difference in like if you're comparing the analyzing samples the proportion of two things like 30 percent in one sample yeah 30 percent in the other sample is there a difference well that depends on how accurately the 30 percent and the 70 percent was calculated and then that depends on the number of reads supporting either allele so then the main hypothesis is that there is no difference I mean so the difference is zero and then there are tests which try to take what if you have more than two samples we also point out the building separate maternal and paternal genomes works fine within organism unless you have a coherent sequence because you don't have phase grind that's easier on your right so can the parents of donate sperm an egg but for those homozygous differences like say you just had so like what you're talking about is maybe a hybrid from the wild whose genomic DNA you of course can sample right aligning that to a reference you know how do we then call our individual know if you've collected two hybrids from the wild and mated them there's still a question of phase within each of the balance does each of the parents I'm trying to make the analogy to humans where each of the parents is outbred the difference is still matter then so you can still determine what whether the homozygous variants but what which homozygous variants go there together very very messiah's unionize our camera so then you're trying to get allele specific expression from a situation where you don't know any little source of information one more question question so you focus on the technical aspects of this which is tools and technical are you guys using a legal specific expressions may be a proxy for isoparm expression where you alleles in particular splicing structures you can show differential splicing within this this comes up almost every time I talk that we actually aren't but our collaborators use we're using the same set of data our collaborators Brett and gravely who is part of the modencode project for Drosophila is actually using this data to look at differences in regulation between slicing sort of not our my or my labs area of expertise but someone's using this data exactly for that so what one idea that might be crazy I didn't really think it's true but you're solving the problems allele-specific expression by first aligning to the genie regina maybe you could like make a Llewellyn specific differential expression without alignment at all because there's so sort of counting counting gamers maybe or other hashes of the camera counting could maybe work for that of course assuming you can map those cameras back back to their location in genome would be like oh yeah I'm trying to think how that work you might be able to do something that independent of reference genome or maybe I'd ever seen alright thanks again
