up in Traverse City of all places with feeling so sorry for Alex don't forget this signup sheet here blowing underneath Louisa is a senior research scientist at the department of medicinal chemistry that's an old term for our very important thing it's in our College of Pharmacy obviously you know that structure of molecules and how molecules interact with small molecules interact with receptors and structures so hugely important to our understanding of how pharmaceutical agents work you know what we're gonna hear about is really a number of very informative protein structural tools and capabilities that under you've developed over many years time and you know it's really gonna be a kind of big yes ruin high-level tour of not only your work but it's gonna be informative you know us but what's done is pharmaceutical chemistry looking at in memory and most of these tools and databases we do now grew and years and and really complicated proposition layer itself includes more than a thousand if Furber technical drugs targeting just for example BBC are arranged with the bilayer and peripheral protein who would like to move their memory in finding activities also there are making it small merry-go-round which can be read through the lipid bilayer and some of them agree to the federal public TV drugs would be metabolites regulators and so on and other require our transporters the key transported through their lipid bilayer because they are polar so we are developing computer systems precisely to address some of these regions today I will tell about three different little be hidden topics and three different are PE PE types of Archimedes new model trust will be modeling consists of a decent person and therefore sequences this is our PTM appropriate lip service and 40m database another subject is today's modern including its instructors so pretty relatively simple and I think I've been advocating complexes which are usually Campos only one or two and I think it is like balancing between Kumar Dino get the retirees this is Kashmir and then go over traversing mera naam be a base and the third part is modeling which is giving ability of molecules also increase ETF is good it is value layer this is money or so younger truckers and our current database it would be our three parts in my code today and all together we created more than five waves orders and three TVs and actually method since the ethical business and that is although this equation how the life of these methods are how useful they are and so on so when we develop these tools we use a number create general detail just all I will methods are physics based in the trade with I didn't in three individual by voting contraction of different compounds or protein stiffness and so on and this way it is usually can be experimental measured and compared with result of computation then I will try to extensively this are I'll get info available experimental data and we also in be nothing as easy to use web tools but everyone can use them or independently verify how they work something good can be applied on a very scale so it can be applied to retirements modeling for example having raw materials or single calluses or entire protein databank and zone so we need white scale applications and the result of our large-scale applications are available to know the environment so everyone can look at them so one of important features here probably the most important that we are trying to reproduce is an excuse me the energies and contributions and I wasn't based on their for example we have development model of the failure to calculate in the transfer of small molecules or proteins from water to TV pilot we heat up to my dynamic model of my placate experimenting to reproduce the genomic stability of hyperkinesis when they are powered to my son from memory and we develop new cases in first you need the energy of the moving africanus association improper and additionally we don't use our molecular dynamics will be here and that's why our method to completion the ability to be fast compared to and there are many different reasons in the PDB for example this is like part number one arrangement and some of them have a curricula and others have a pizza bar over it and also a bacterium for important boxes which makes this a sixth order for proteins just wouldn't but then they relate with each other and they release hydrophobic parts of this after such a sentence or technically fanfic editors and the one i channel to the membrane irreversibly and this channel usually you pull there is a great variety Oh having produce with different parts but and these structures are available in the protein database but we don't know how exactly these proteins are arranged with respect to the lipid bilayer we don't know where the lab suppose I haven't found it from the reason we have the little significant amount of what and basically pull in water and important parameter is the distance between is a boundary place because it defines hydrophobic of osmium proteins and they said a political network operating from different types of memories of a different class for example if you do these calculations they beat the parents in outer bacterial memories relatively smooth cyclic thickness around 24 to 25 I'm sorry and they are thicker in proteins from their inner bacterial memories and even more thicker a little bit like in averages 33 aren't in proteins from plasma membranes of your tentative steps so this is important parameter hypothesis which we also need to determine so what we get is relatively simple we'll take the dimension structure from the coordinate a bit this could be penetrable transmembrane protein we partitioned in our program and the result now OPM database which currently includes around 10,000 Givi engines but how we do basically is trying to find the lowest energy arrangements for the wedding is a lipid bilayer good we optimized Google is equally immunization of transferring energy of death but American from water - there are hydrophilic invite and these are surveillance the function includes your salvation energy current introducing like hydrogen words between for example writing and what are we solving and related to that movement of the protein and also can be loosen from ionizer but in order to use these equations we listen to some parameters like in circulation well we different types of atoms and we determine them we need to know within determine using other equations and to do that we need to know in molarity how fidelity of the neighboring change in different position a week today abnormal cross the lipid bilayer so you don't need like an enthalpy or or a entropy term combined together yes for political salvation energy it is very difficult to separate enthalpy we think it can be done for this is Sigma Sigma for example living in groups are hydrophobic interactions which are of entropic nature and also make into hydrogen bonds which are often tied with nature but the second Tori this second term I recited this is purely the entire picture and this is main through the actually because depends on tteo groups so it's mainly to the board but when we're trying to separate entity entity countries another approach which will be net one of the next we will use the city clear information entropy of site keeps the changes conformation and at your side chains when 150 this is a straight with each other this explicitly and for people tickets so here we actually P when we try to develop this measure to pump that will be three identity parameters of this wouldn't remove the second these parameters are known like hydrogen pointing donor and acceptor capacity of the student and also people entity pariah these parameters are widely used for kindest words to describe there we can see that yeah by Liam SS Weldon yes I knew that working story so the proper kid are these Panera key parameters can change along there Yuliya more no change we use a distribution of different groups it was like it would you easy by layer and this Missy person's weight will be determined and others today and you know capital e so he determined how these parameters a key above the normal and then to calculate really thought about this before but you should that really remarkable structure that looks like a tree o Monson some of its in the membrane and some of its outside yeah in my guess is that you know the outside part which has a different energy you know you know you know they also try to do it for political groups in three dimensional structures in protein and we published I think about it so actually I mean at least do the different row from some kind of effective biological name so for example using this approach we can calculate speed movement only transmitted problem here there I protect if your own protein as an example this was our collaboration with people from Canada we should published in DMV and what this method can our data can determine can determine which views will be training with the absolute change region and howdy and also we calculate a free energy combined transfer entropy change in association of this world is hit by them and we can compare these related videos with women who babies for an hour even believe it telephone pole all this what role but for a number of others so it was published with virtual and there is a sufficiently good relation but it depends on our computational models we try to and we actively improve this the second most ppm problem oh we can predict even for example any place element by some other residues like as party itches absolutely it will admit at the party and basically that when the existing videos they have our ppm web server which allows modeling viniferamine's me every wasn't seen then finally really available the result of calculation see 10,000 Givi entries and this one is also crucified two different classes to confirm these instruments and really there are maybe around a thousand of different phenotypic variants also provide a poetry and intercellular recognization so you can actually pros brutally basing motivations uses various and so on and so on and it look at the content you can see the transmembrane proteins I took a little in the bottom they can see cute the lesson huh produce in the daily lives for others at the advice we also treat with visible layers and hepatic and transmitter interface and presidency and others are water soluble proteins political or some of them can say permanently but there are many of them and this data cannot be found in any other resources so and also is a ppm webserver facing outside inside yeah so we all your energy function can help how much of coding idea how deep is this in the membrane yes but you cannot tell whether it face in style outsider style even American we define topology in this database so we take topology from experimental sources we don't do our like ab initio of the quality oh that is like positive insightful for example yeah I talking about the poaching I'm not sure what you mean by apology I say well how this again is the to inside or outside yeah engaging can be I need at this way another way yes this is both tennis memory compose so this information it is important to note oppose it because the international with an exorcism of parts are different so basically usually it supposed is a well known for proteins in the TV and you can look at their publication by crystallography ins is there to simply take a puja from these publications whatever is indicated in the disappointing publication like almost a million and it was the cited in the literature publications more than a thousand times what is widely used and it is also integrated another by informatics services even in um this is you have a breakdown I'm an intern pharma versus pharmaceutical company but I would be good to know you know but some of them are on purpose it was wrong that they are oh I hate a lot of critics buildings over the email with different people about it and maybe significant part of them work from pharmacy but some of most of them probably appear for students or researchers and this is kind of like our current equals diagram how our resources are allocated because initially everything was located at the University of Michigan and we use HP and HP and what it is you will decide to increase the complete sustainability and right now we want to use get a body to ash cloud at the University for calculation this very very is what you get actually intensity of charge and significant computational users yeah well our web servers this is this is really a very good resource and it would be about available to us it's some berry it's a densely it's as a dense computing stack it's very high speed good data i/o and it's it's free and available to us and some of the algorithms that we run crash flops is kind of thing they worked really nicely on the other bytes so it's something to check out to save money but other disciplines right now like eat it which right another place so we use like pull out right now storage and we use a Roku fan base and we also use the part of for voice so we try to do some things but we work with computer science students and they like try different things happen to change because I tell the way they would they went from something do we eat like 10 years ago 15 years ago if it was only pitch keep my eye and my back okay so a lot of experiments here plates of proteins will be a three-dimensional structure is include the calculations very fast and produces cartina coordinates of the produce actually have been bound and it was better than in terms of precision and some other tools which can use only potassium a product because this is the only tool that can be used right now for P developer so that was like a big part of my talk today and the second part is about a single spinning fight over here is writings and great for this and basically into speaking presently only one man's memory nitrogenous but they care about what actually built our agency frequently on the both side of the membrane and they are highly highly diverse and look at the human membrane protein for example almost half of human memory proteome are with motive projects there are more than provide interaction some of them are enzymes and supporters are they involve memory trafficking like human trafficking and also and they do go to win here well Boone our famous remedies like receptor tyrosine kinases integrins adhesions and so on and so on and all of them have different cells so this is very important class of proteins more than 600 contain this mm I'm votin developing for different diseases from cancer to diabetes or viral infections or whatever and some of them I bought this little transaction like receptors for the outside inside the cell and they do they become pretty big ah what a horrible damage on the both sides and they frequently for diamonds homodimers will get on the divers and during the binding of the Liga they changed the significant confirmational changes in this part wasn't fully booked at the extracellular but and then they are infiltrated of this hyperkinesis changes and the signal transducer inside their cell where the confirmation of a receiver and activated the means became ethernet begin and activate and then they directly some other drug so but basically what we are using here only this part let's me a vampire so we would like to Moodle residential structure of this NGO mon gate our diners and is it important to model them in visual information space because it change information state during signal transduction and this can be done actually for many thousand this different by public proteins in the entire program so what we do here basically within a community that's not a structure random from our F we end up with reversal programs which we use and they do modeling of individual activities or hypothetical guidance and the desert of this what we do our memorandum database which includes the dimensional model spoke dialects and models and so on so the first part of this software is our program health map which calculates structure and stability of facilities in computers with memories which would be entry surface and also I mean now I'm working with this EBT system puzzles and that is they pulled in Atma solution is considered a to the different stage and we can see relationship tips of the process like first convocation of educators in water and then a transfer of that from water today we have rain in the area so the energy of binding for fancies from two parts would transfer as a super place is just absurd part we use our imaginary qualified recently this information membranes it will come some time ago and in that case we are interested to calculate these energies between well like recycling at the folder structure or advocates of it issue and this energy expression includes sample taken from the Genesis titles like advocate so because it professes and some other terms which can be that it can be evaluated or empirical and the second third ranked it is exactly the same as what the aim program which you talk about people so and regional triplets and the same is with water and but with the sportrack in the video are against that but then we need to properly structure of the divers some woman or get the divers within their lipid environment when the poor activities are within the evident entry to interact in association and in that case we give you at least a ten dollar poodles weekend program which includes us I mean HTTP minute the previous problem here a souvenir ultra calluses and then given initial practice of the diamond actually sometimes template killing sampling procedure and localization anthos my program and then finally the police of the three energetic of association and this is most important part because there are different modes of helix helix Association and to identify the native flex actually to be able to separate it from other iconic possibly include stuff also it is possible that there is no any association maybe these two hyperkinesis are completely separated and those from any diamond because it is not in a ditch in favor that make difference as well so we need to use this free energy of Association can be compared with fully experimental ways and this energy of Association includes different contribution such as changes in conformational entropy of side chains using finding salvation attractive energy within the membrane relations of case dipoles archive is important on the vise interactions basically between two allocated by the parameters of energy functions here a different from this in the mannequin we can one day night and we derive from protein G data so we verify these things off method and the worst two different ways to verify first we needed to appear experimental experimental and calculated innocent of killing scallops association villages and they were wasted for me in public so many times men come with diamonds myself and the deeper layers so there is a good pedal issue but we can a little bit others committed video affinity so you do micro Callum rabbit range make measurements thermodynamic measurement data already published in the literature so we took a we can complete if you don't do any computation and compare published experimental tapes for the same bankers and when we template driving but we populated these structures with aluminum are pious models around 1.5 to three arcs so this is more or less a kiss good precision and also verification totally an amount day to pass mania - potato protein suicide using cyclic me the Genesis coming to the Genesis and Scott there are more men more than 30 of them who have published and we also do these days and then we decided to use it for genome-wide modeling and analysis of homodyne it will be gamma diamonds but and what we eat here we look like 6000 proteins from different species human arrivederci yes helium is Nikolai and so on and we finally article selected around 2000 most stable Terrace nearly died from a diverse include them in running analysis and what happens there are some interesting trends for example we found the terrible woman Thailand inhale periods and the most year like for example for human if you were significant larger numbers and 1404 already goes surprising because of these credits and the Tigers are both in PE itself cell interactions so this is like obesity organism very similar again and P most of them are receptors you can look at the distributions by species by functions or by different types of about logical game and what happens most of these Nagas are situated in the plasma memory in high and the most of them are deserts but there are also many enzymes and they are not necessarily see that one coming back to intercept method and another interest which is directly due to the spiritual organization for these Puma divers some of them can be defined as right with and this with right-handed are moves and if they are less as people they are flexible and they usually present in receptors and therefore they can be more frequently taught in class earlier but in poetry in they are mostly we can find the thymus from by enzymes with more stable Analia in the diagonals though there are some interesting trends about no one gives these analysis of diamonds before where you are Gaius and the results are six pieces six thousand proteins without the diamonds they are also testified to more than one thousand of families and they can easily browse here the database also include some genetic variants or mutations in transmembrane alpha helixes and these mutations are equal to be elevated like can't especially in case of cancer and many other and we also provide compresses access to liking who mixes in the court in the end for this 20 proteins and protein protein interactions but this is all the interactions between to be put differently topic proteins like one year process which can be in more context of transmitting articles also suppose an intracellular organization and so this is pretty significant with a lot of data and with circuit one of them is map remodeling cofactor Cadence's in different conditions and can be used for campus what are my sons needed by their operating and the in book web server which can be used water modeling that we and applications on diamonds and it produces different models of divers and the models can be easily visualized we get more so when we do this visualization what happens could be several different models of mechanics can be speaking using GMOs I can use boundaries and user can click a different practice and the different structures will be shown is output and will also reduce movement the interfaces will be so the output and their images so it's my good like and me third part of my talk today is about the ability of molecules or through their membranes and here that would become ability of small molecules like drugs Anthony ability of their diets and formally we made it like two separate programs dependent webtools because in that case you use a single emanations yeah you need to just make the structure of the image coordinate of the small molecule drug from Cuba other uses and they go through our web server to calculate them okay I'll turn about and then is also equally in the database by this opponent is not only a leading coefficient condition but allocation pathway there are limitations but when you read it rotates and different air intakes trying to minimize energy in every point of this shooting this movie so what we do in this mirror we move across the lipid bilayer and in each point of this pathway we do optimal rotational orientation of the molecule it takes to expose to water parks an acquaintance building nonpolar parts of the movie then we draw this energy curve they depend on political it's a power that was and can begin a mole per year or nobody essentially nobody else for hydrophobic compounds all can the significant value for polar compounds and then we integrate this liquor to calculate suppose permeability coefficient which show how fast the molecules that we buy them and those VD coefficients will measure experimentally per minute it will come out in different experimental systems and can be compared with the result of our relationship so what we did comparison with politely membranes and the positions were the most relevant system because what we do in this calculation so basically consider something like your PC and see what would be the mobility rate for this blue piston we learn something simulates all it can be actually and another new model by there and we did for a nice and a nice compound and that is a pretty good consistency here with guilt around unit and significant regulation but vegetation it will be more ethical of what the metadata about ability through a lamprey Maria in that case but at the same time it could be also some transported simple well it can be some ethnic single compounds that go to yourself across the salient and move back by exported but even in that case that is a sufficiently good regulation between our populations and the result of the nobility through will be be forgiving and it is possible put up or at least approximately distinguish in compounds which in trade or don't rate to the central nervous system so it can be used as a pretty cool but with their successful attend is a real physical system like just really where you have only basic diffuse without any possibility of additional active or facilitating issues so and we created also this one web server and database which are populating permeability coefficients for small molecules and then I given it opens more optimization here also calculate by McAfee is of small molecule very good by the way in addition to permeability rates and we've also create your database which take data for about five hundred most well-studied drugs and drag like molecules well slightly meaning hidden ability coefficients to be experimental instead which is also accessible and this web server also provide a visualization of results of complex verses provides their energy energy of the molecule and also provides which is using the same key mode when you can predict a given position and so money can give you values as it moves across lipid bilayer and we can even throw kind of movie alimony can move from a five million so it is raised in such way to expose volume and beauty back up for the girls this is by depressive doing is unit is an example exactly the same way to ask for proteins and peppers because this is my general physical movement that can be used for protein spirits molecules and finally we are working right now to develop the selfie mm for peptides but it is currently under development yeah all of them upside and in that case you can use a single amino acid sequence and look at the prediction of your ability to cross the lipid bilayer basically be appreciative and again put it recharge this is a marked by blue and they are trying to stay out so in reality you know when you realize these are working through very crowded regions this thing I mean you know it's you know there's a lot of crowding in there that's you know so I wonder how they don't know basically you can parallel lives and if this is fluid bilayer this type of small molecules mostly supposed to interact with these but of course if you also have proteins or maybe connect with the protein surface before I buy the protein surface of tellurium this may appear that's my bad yes if you can just try working or channa then of course it would be completely different story but even with the surface it may affect like it may get consideration so this is the kind of opportunity so basically this is the kind of reason if you look at least in courts for example for comparison which is very mentally maybe Confucian but for politically peculiar you don't have any projects in real life situation I to be really quite blood-brain barrier for it out we definitely think have a lot of process yeah and this is the made you one of the reason for these differences of living can consider the consistency is not so good as it might be this is worse than for is also a tomorrow yeah this is like a baseline what would happen if we don't have any active tracks but let's compare what happens with me reality and then we have some disciplines do it can be explained by air flux or epi transfer within the cell so you don't need to consider this just as a while more poops and poopy that's a face life so what contributes to the asymmetry of the energy profiles ah this is different ways we would like to calculate the energy value here for example if we do that a genetic mutation without energy just find the communication opposition to each point across the lipid bilayer then what happens we make some radical which is estimated the definitive membrane then find optimal orientation which is basically flip-flop and we neglect this energy of leapfrog this leads to other estimated value over here that's why here I've eaten so called instead of bloom just that this is still one of possible options and this exist in this earth but here I'm using so-called drug here when you basically the taking you and drive it through some point with a lipid bilayer and when we drive it are you calculate energy which package and when you do that you have thin ice kinetic energy cure because what happens he examines a position or still somewhere then suddenly retain just without any additional by ear but just local energy minimization in Maine that is European no precise estimate of the actual energy by here of the techno process but begins a significant so this is has two different offices for musicians not that simple and working with this well-known problem if you have like some kind of pass energy pass some complicated image resources and move scientists how to determine the value of like lowest point of the bus when you pass from one where you have one already pay another way and that is what happens here this is not just a local energy optimization when you justify trying to find local or global energy me but finding the bus initially I allowed to do that paid freely in some orientation and but actually you can start from different initial annotation and see how the defense it's also doesn't affect much because what happens is good but the form shape of this curve may actually change depending on the initial any days yes but the results know basically what you have to do it's morally no more complicated because you have several million number of different components so for example methods I'm trying to do local in here like optimize especially for theater P my side chains and forwards in this position so I don't consider any energy but yet between if side chains and folders you can see them to move freely from one arrived allocation to another this is of course approximately game yeah I'm trying to do just don't make it too complicated because we need to have a relatively fast procedure to be able to use it on food web servers like that for example for small molecules the user is allowed to include like a set of different conformance basically you can run through any kind of software and then generate a set of possible components like module one moto2 moto3 in PDB files and then include them in the YouTube file if you do that when the program I choose the optimal conformer in different voice of the transmitter in very try story but that what can see that I can see that each time format is a rigid body it's like a set of rigid deep in the rigid bodies so again this is like food approximation so that's considered evening conference by do it now very approximate way and the value of some their size of the initial sample can be heated you can include like three conformance like thousand but if it's thousand then it would be slow yes when we did it we use some software we do surplus and analysis for example plus an analysis two different masters because in different parts of conformational space and you take just one represent me for each cluster and that we would please set around this set of components through the membrane this is kind of better than just not basically include conformational flexibility is important because them will come for additional side chains here important and for example become saenko city highly flexible organic molecule you need to take into account the base can be like they're like that so you must include several component but they how sign greening maybe not for verifying grain may be very close written by the kids trade between speed and accuracy figure out for the option to generate those comforters or the user not really not because there are some other tools we teaching for generating California communities so I assume that you that will generate no actual even par camp or provides a number of different controllers so you're supposed to generate and using other tools and then use it yes but 4px I am still working like the Sherman is working but the underlying programmer I'll see you on puppies but those who would use your practically so and finally I would say about our future directions because looking like pea plants one of and those that we do several great purpose are playing right now in defeat if on what will be funded make you different things one of the thing with development wooden bullets or modeling Oh in this would allow us to consider to analyze interaction networks or veto reproduce because we don't know that we know about interactions proteins NZ but we don't know is the internet water soluble domains Oh turns me away deletes and we can try to answer this question by using this software and we can try to preheat influence of potential drivers cancer mutations inference membrane tendons of the topic proteins or we can develop modern computers between single alpha helix and multipass membrane proteins with known three-dimensional structure or we can look at the wooden pathways and evolution of structures of Multi calavaras marrying rottens KwaZulu can calculate for example stability of alpha key enemies like if you have qualifications you can tell if we will be stable association in the protein structure unstable to the stage you can stable I'm through here pins like in certain cytochrome B for example are there it may be like heh between say it's moving on this are pretty public receive it just enjoy when Denis I would like to accomplish this work myself and I would like pink pop quiz here and we achieve my constant most important collaborator during all these years without joy will not be possible I would like to thanks to me hey girl I'm geezer who is my son p.m. new Murano databases and I can move in it supported initial stages yeah I remember him and I'll invite my 25 years and we get another degree computer science students who we're wanted to train using kaavo like resources and improve their skills but at the same time they you know this web service wonderful web servers and databases and so on and it is a playground for popular science I thank you for attention thank you ok any questions yes madam so like for example in conformance the diesel I believe in psychic importance for example not we can excuse it's late independence library of Sachin controller and then when you generate then you can do local energy minimization space of course and endless with certain ports feels like for example each EVP or it may be five dCPP right now and then you can calculate like conformational energy Oh free energy which is a given oh I do like a national search using some libraries of current words for example and I do vocalizations for example for the moon driving the society I actually do a library of psychic and furnaces that are allowed a certain position of this deity but that allows to speed up significantly the compilation containing any more questions so I don't use any because if I used in to take like a hundred times older or maybe thousand twenty thousand times oh my god isn't here yeah did you now Pritam's you seem to run plenty fast you spend much time optimizing them or do they run in parallel allows to get the bike local allows for an innovation I am planning to do sample initiation of the code but I didn't yet so basically it's a scenic on a single processor but what it takes maybe half an hour for the biggest structures like if you want to partition every 40 synthetic fabrics like polish fusion protein cotton balls it takes maybe an almost an hour but for smaller words much less but if you do it use it through email you just received a reply by mail with the results okay thanks very very much okay
