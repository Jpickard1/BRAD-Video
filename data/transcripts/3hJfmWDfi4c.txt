so i'm thinking about moving here already okay okay so actually i have uh i have many things to say and then i really probably i'm too greedy i prepared a lot of things and um but now i have a better idea about about what i what i should talk about and then and then so i'll try to to deliver so what the the the interesting areas or topics are within the control of example or population systems that might be related to what you are doing so i'll try my best and i'm poor in biology so yeah okay so so in system science and uh and engineering actually so in past decades so research has been focused on the modeling and control of just a single or a small number of systems and this is a typical application is to design an input that will steer this system from an initial state to a desired target state so this is very typical and this is very um this is quite straightforward actually okay so now in recent years uh we have seen a lot of complicated systems like brand and social networks of tremendous scale and they are prevalent in nature and human society and these are these complex systems or networks actually they are often constituted by a large number of structurally identical or structurally similar dynamical units so we have we are seeing uh a significant shift of research towards analyzing or controlling collective behavior of population systems so here are some uh widely observed population systems right so the neurons are cell population group animals robots and wind farms and social networks so there's a common uh feature in all these systems so so the system actually contains a large number of identical units right and so the control in many application domains the control and observation can only be implemented at the population level through for example through broadcasting an input signal such as a common signal broadcasting to the entire population right so each node actually is receiving the same input right or through receiving aggregated measurements in this way so this is an electrician of a recording of spiking activity in a population of neurons right so you recall this on spiking activity and if you look at the top view right so these are the spikes and then in in many cases actually the the spiking activity can be monitored as a whole right so like this but the activity of each individual neuron might not be known right so you can you can just observe this as a population level measurement okay then um so under this uh restricted conjoined observation scenarios uh a fundamental question to ask is as follows right so if we have a population system can we design inputs so that we can take off the populations from the same initial state to a common final state right or can we do more can we do pattern formation can we take this pattern and then we switch this pattern to another pattern and then we we do another transition to separate this into another pattern so so these are common questions uh to ask and this is a more realistic um example right so if we consider a population of neurons and they initially they might be typed randomly right in a random fashion and we wanted to know whether it is possible to induce desired spiking patterns like this can we spike off them simultaneously or can we create any arbitrary synchronization patterns with high spatial and temporal precision right so this would be uh of interest in neuroscience and i'll i'll give you more examples uh so the first one is uh in the quantum domain right so in uh mr spectroscopy imaging a typical goal is actually to apply uh something called radio frequency field and you won't need to excite the entire population on this order from an initial state to a desired final state right and then this is a very important step towards uh affording protein structures or medical diagnosis and brain stimulation right so this is to affect or to desynchronize thousands of neurons in the brain right so that that cause uh some pathological synchrony right and so in training a population of circadian cells right so we have a population of cells with different slightly different clocks and how can we design inputs so that we can expand all the clocks into the uniform class right and also in cancer therapy so sorry so uh the the the the treatment might not be uh so the cancer cells might have different response to to to a common treatment right so how can we design a treatment strategy so that the response to the treatment would be uniform right okay many more right in mechanical systems in robotics right so senseless manipulation and then you do this rolling ball right so you have a single control to control a group of systems simultaneously right so all these are within this application domain right so controlling example system okay so these these are the the main challenges let me recap okay so the first one is the under actuated nature of the control right again so we can only apply very very few inputs or a single input but we wanted to manipulate a huge population right and the second one is lack of state feedback right so for each individual system imagine that if we had thousands of systems if we wanted to measure each individual system then we have to put in uh thousands of sensors right so this is uh impractical so this requires too many sensors so in practice actually we can only uh collect such aggregated measurements snapchats right so can we use this to uh to estimate the system dynamics or to design a robust control strategy right and also the lack of mathematical models right so in general it's very hard to for example to model the brain dynamics right but we could have many many data available to us and we pass from the data to write down a mathematical model right so so these are challenges okay so here are the here comes my the goals of my talk right so i i plan to actually to formally introduce the notion and mathematical formulation of example control problems and the second part i will i will ask yeah i will go over this uh quickly without too much technical details i will present some uh state-of-the-art methods in analyzing controllability and to optimal control design and i will show you a lot of simulation results a lot of videos animations and also show you some real experimental results uh and then i will talk about our recent work on moment-based methods for for controlling examples and if time permits i i will talk about data driven on the network difference okay so here comes i have a few slides uh with some math so so this is a harmonic oscillator so if you are familiar with uh with linear systems theory so so this is the model and then u and v are the other control input right so in this case if we wanted to design this pair u and v so that we can take this system from this initial state to this design target state similar to the first animation that i showed right so this is a very very straightforward problem it's very easy to check that the system is controllable meaning any pair of initial and target states can be reached right so and then it's very easy to write down a minimum energy control law right so this problem is very very simple okay so now if we can see the population of these right so if we take many of these and then it looks like this right and we put this into a big system right so they these are the motions right so now when the number of these oscillators goes to infinity and this matrix becomes an infinite dimensional matrix right so we wanted to ask the same question so is design symbol systems still controllable and how to construct and open an optimal control law right so these are the natural questions that we wanted to ask okay okay so then um so this is the formal formulation of the example system right so i take one system and then this is uh this is the dynamical law that this system follows right and beta1 is the parameter and i check the second system and this second system follows the same dynamical law and controlled by the same input but the parameter value is slightly different right so for example the frequency of this one may be different from the frequency of this one right so beta is other other parameters right and then if we can take n of this by a finite number of these right so now when n goes to infinity right so we have a huge number of even finite yeah finally many of infinitely many and we can actually write this as a parameterized system of this form right so this is a family of uh of our dynamical systems or control systems indexed by beta controlled by the same input use right so this is a form of formulation and then the idea is that in the classical system if we only consider one system and then we are starting on the problem of steering or controlling this system between two points in rn right so now we are trying to control or to steer systems between two functions right so the functions are the functions of beta so the population function right and then uh so this is this is controllability so yeah so we say that this system is controllable if if there exists uh an input they can steer the system from any initial function to a neighborhood of target function right so so now we are trying to steer the system from this function of beta to another function of beta right so it's the later you are going to see why these are why this is related to how this is related to the applications right anyways also these are the the definition with respect to different topologies let me skip that so okay so so in the following slides actually i just wanted to show that um probably i should did i skip this this is very very system theoretic stuff so anyway so i wanted to show you that uh so the controllability can be studied uh by a techniques or polynomial approximation so i think i should uh i should skip this actually okay so this is what i wanted to show okay so we started this system so this system is a system uh modeling the evolution of a population of nuclear spins right so this is called the block equation okay and then so you can see that there are two parameters omega actually omega denotes a lot more frequency actually uh so we consider a population of nuclear spins with frequencies lying in this range right so that is omega and epsilon is called rf and homogeneity when you apply a field and the field could be in homogeneous right so there are two parameters right and then so this is actually a population of systems with given values of omega different values of epsilon right and then we actually we have already shown that this system is actually controllable meaning in the context of mr spectroscopy and imaging so this means that any excitation profile is possible okay so so anyway so so this is very very important so if you if you take a population of nuclear spins and then they are sitting in the equivalent equilibrium stage right and then in many applications we wanted to excite this population of spin systems into a certain state so now i can say i wanted to do this and then so so the countability in first that indicates that after any actual excitation profile is possible and this is very important for for pro for uh mr protein right so spectroscopy and for mri so i just wanted to show you that and then so here comes to the uh the computation of optimal control and again so i can just show you the main idea so this is the linear system right so i have a population and then i can turn this into this integral equation anyway so then i so the design is basically based on mutation of singular values right but this is more important okay so now i take this example of harmonic oscillators right and then so the goal is that okay so so i take this population i place this population into this uh configuration right so this is x and y and then each dot corresponds to some example corresponding to different frequency values right so and then i i think they are like 81 or 101 of this here and the goal is that i wanted to apply this uh broadcast input umv so umv is applied to every single one right and i want to turn this pattern into this pattern right and then and then this design can be just through very simple singular value decomposition and it so so this is the pair of u and v and following this input you can see that you don't know what's going on but you are sure that after this desired uh prescribed time instance so the pattern can be formed so in this application actually so this although this is a very simple case this is just a linear case so you can take a population and then assuming that you know the model you know the perimeter values and then we can actually design a broadcast input so that you can do any pattern information right so this is already proved okay and then we extended these two to actually to more complicated systems meaning to non-linear systems uh let me skip this uh and i just wanted to show you uh so we we based on this uh these are results for linear systems right actually we can devise another algorithm to solve for any type of system for example by linear systems non-linear systems and uh iteratively so let me so i still wanted to show you this uh this is uh in mr so this is called broadband excitation parts right so you wanted to you take a population of spins and you wanted to excite all of them from the north pole to in this case to from zero zero one to one zero zero right so this is the this is the control that we computed right and then applying this you can see that they will be steered to the same point so i'm just showing you uh all these applications and this is a real experiment in mr protein mr spectroscopy anyway so that's i think this is this is probably more relevant to to uh to you so can we design controls or design inputs to study synchronization or to control synchronization so this is actually a video from my my biology collaborator eric herzog so i remember that this is a this is a three day three days of recording of uh something called uh period two protein expression at the uh microscope stage right so this shows the the the ktm rhythms okay so the idea is that can we control the rhythms right so can we make different spiking or different uh rhythmic patterns right so so actually that is related to controlling athletes right because um so we treat every neuron as an oscillator so this is the main idea so if you take an oscillator and then oscillator could be n-dimensional that oscillator will have a stable attractive limit cycle right so like this this is n-dimensional and if you are familiar with a phase reduction technique for example you have probably you have heard about chromosomal model so the idea is that this is n-dimensional and this is a periodic orbit and actually one can map this periodic object to a unit circle right so just you know you can see the one-to-one correspondence right so you can actually map this uh to a unit circle and then this n-dimensional system can be reduced to a one-dimensional system actually over this unit circle so now we take a bunch of these right so we consider the population of this and then we can model circadian cells using this model actually so the theta i theta is the phase and this is the oscillation frequency and then u is the input and then this is the coupling right so if you consider chromosomal models uh and actually the coupling would be the sinusoidal wave right so here we can see the population of neurons and as oscillators and we wanted to control synchronization right so the idea is as follows right so so the definition of synchronization is that if you take two dynamical systems in this case if you take two oscillators and then these are their trajectories right and we say that these two systems are synchronized so after some time t if the difference between their trajectory remains uh a constant right so then they are synchronized right initially they could be they could be uh totally different i mean they are not synchrony right so and then after some time if the phase if the trajectory difference remains a constant then we said that this is uh synchronized right so this is the condition very simple relation right so theta 1 of t minus theta 2 of t is a constant when t is greater than some time right so after some time they remain a constant right okay so then if we wanted to design a synchronization pattern so for example if i take these two uh oscillators i i wanted to keep these two oscillators in this relation right so over time so the distance between these two will be fixed right and then we can actually formulate this problem as a trading problem meaning uh we can take this uh reference trajectory so this is theta d right so we can take data d like this we can just assign this this is face life yeah yeah and face luck for all time after some time right so i wanted to lock the face right so the face right okay so then i'm going to to create this theta d and my requirement is that theta y minus theta d is a constant and this relation holds for all the pairs right so anyway so then this is actually uh originally this this this could be a very challenging problem to for the design right so you wanted to you have a population of neurons and non-linear and you wanted to design inputs so that you can you can you can make make the phase lock right but if we look at this in this way we can formulate this as a trading problem so basically we are just trying to track this trajectory right at this at this constant distance okay so so now uh this is an example where i i took four neurons uh chain half three neurons and then they started with the same initial state but they have different frequencies and i wanted to design an input so that over time i wanted to make them to form this pattern right so you can see that so this is the input that i'm applying and you can see that after many many cycles so they started to be apart right and yeah it would take some time and you can see that finally the face pattern is gonna be locked right so i'm going to lock this into four groups for for these type of fittings however you can you can always do that yeah so because because the idea is that um okay so depend because when you do tracking you do need to tolerate uh some uh error so if you allow that then they will be and then you can in the same idea right so if you take a 100 neurons right with different frequencies and then i can say okay so i wanted to create this uh complete desynchronization pattern right and this could be useful for conceptually for different stimulation right because you wanted to break the synchrony and this is the most synchronized case right so you get the idea so you can from this trading problem you just try to make the distance constant and then you can do whatever you like so you can assign any different groups right yeah and the computation is actually very easy so you just do yeah so if you are interested in this i can i can show you more okay and then this is a real experiment experimental results are for chemical oscillators right so this is uh this this was done in my collaborator uh doctor is vanquish uh lab so he started his uh chemical athletes so in this case he actually placed this array of oscillators for 20 years later and then these are the the color bar denotes the initial phase right so they are randomly distributed i mean the the initial phase is random right and then if you put these oscillators on this uh phase circle they look like this so these are the initial conditions and these are the color color codes right and then the application here is to show that we are able to design the waveform so that we can turn this pattern into all and then switch this to k and then switch this back to o so we just wanted to demonstrate that actually we can do this and so you can see that this is uh this is a real experimental result so if you if we apply we design this input right so a global input applied to these 20 oscillators and you can see that you can turn the pattern to k and then we can switch it back to all right so there are there are some uh further applications along this side so they could be related to information encoding so you can encode actually your information inside this uh array of athletes right so for example you if initially if you are given this right and then you do need to use this path key the path key is your waveform you do need to use use this path key in order to reveal this information in this uh in this oscillator network right so so this is also for they are applications for information coding for cyber security so that could be along the way and uh and the next topic is uh moment based and data-driven example control okay so this is our recent work and the idea is that so earlier on you have seen this right so if you take a population of oscillators right and then we i have already shown that we can design open loop control that will be broadcasted now broadcast to to the population and then you can form this to this right but now if we have this kind of measurement data right can we use this measurement data to do the same thing or to do a beta job right and know that actually in this case we do not necessarily need to know the model right so in this case i have a well-defined model i have everything will define meaning the parameter range and i know everything and if that is the case and i can design so now if i have a population system right so like your population of sales and then you actually don't know their dynamics you i don't need to know their model but i can measure this uh that i have snapshots right so how can i use this to do this for example okay so here's the idea so this is just a generic model right so we don't we can forget about that right so now with these measurements the idea is that actually we can compute moments but moments meaning you take this data you compute the mean you compute the second you compute the uh the variance right and you compute the third moment fourth moment you can compute as many as you want right so directly from the data and then so theoretically so i can say okay so if i have a model right and then i'm going to be able to compute off the moments and i can write down a system for the moment right so this moment m is actually m contains the first moment second moment up to uh as many moments as you want right so this is an infinite sequence right okay so i can write down the moment equation so this is my moment system and then so what i wanted to study is that so initially i i'm starting this system and i can i wanted to turn this system from this pattern to this pattern so this pattern could be like the star this pattern could be like the main only right so i wanted to do this but now i might not be able to do this directly because i do not have the system equation right and i wanted to study whether i can do this through this moment system right so instead of controlling this system from here to here can i find the corresponding uh state in the moment system and i want it to control from this moment to this moment right so the idea is that if i can do this through the moment then i can in general actually i'm doing this for the system so this is the this is a rough idea and actually this can be done uh so this is the proof of that so so if you take a system and then we can write down the moment equation and then we borrow these uh very nice uh results from the moment moment problem right so this is called house of moment problems so in this problem the result is that if you have a distribution and then the distribution can be uniquely determined by the moment i'm just talking about the moments yeah but no but if this is an n-dimensional system so you have you have all the questions yeah right so so now yeah but i mean you can theoretically you can you can extend that too if you you can you can have the course terms but now yeah so you're right so here i don't have that so i only have i only have the the variance code yeah okay so now if i have uh if i have this moment system right so the idea is that uh so under some conditions i can actually represent a distribution by using moments right okay so look at this so if we have this kind of data actually we can treat this data as some samples of certain distribution right so this could be samples of some distribution so these are samples of some distributions right and then because my goal is is to take this moment system and i wanted to make this system to turn from this this moment this initial sequence to this final sequence right so so this is uh so any distribution is uniquely determined by the moment right so what we need to do is that if because this is a unique representation so we just need to control if we can control this moment to this moment that means that we can control the original distribution from this to that right so this guarantees the the the uh if and only if relation right so let me show you one example that uh okay so this is uh the same harmonic as a later example i will take a population of harmonic oscillators but now this is the initial date and then this this is the final configuration that we wanted to reach right so this is still very preliminary right and in this case we assume that we can over time we have the measurement data so now it's so we started to evolve the system right and then assuming that we can collect this uh uh mesh chart data and then we actually use this to design this control so the idea is that um so let me go back so we got this uh aggregative measurement and we can compute moments and then um so in order so for the control design actually we can just easily take a linear combination of moments so imagine that so if you wanted to if you have a population right and then you wanted to take this population if you have if you have so if you have a four systems right starting from here and you said that you wanted to take these two to a single position and what you need to do is to actually this is a very simple case right so what you need to do is to guarantee that you are going to fear the moment so you have to make sure that the moment of this that's actually there are four of these and they are centered around the same point so the moment the mean is actually equal to zero and the and the variance is also equal if you can do this and then you can guarantee that all of them are going to but if you wanted to do more complicated patterns like the maple leaf and then you have to utilize a lot more moments in order to achieve that so that's the basic idea any questions right so the the good thing is that um so we really do not need to we do not need to know the dynamics right so we don't need to know okay so your the equations for us for the for the sales equations for the for the neurons and we don't need to know that so as long as we can take pictures and then we have this data and then we can write down the moment equation and then we can use the moment to infer the original dynamics and to do the design you mean uh these are like this yeah so okay so you can write this as um you can represent this by using uh a sequence a sequence of moments right so so for example um let me show you this here right so so from this this is this this is a this is this is the classical moment problem right so the idea is that if you have a distribution so now uh when i define the moment in this way actually i i treat so beta is my random variable so beta beta is the parameter so beta is like my random variable and then this is my distribution x is my distribution right so when i define the moment in this way right so the idea is that okay so what i need to do is that i wanted to switch that system from this pattern to this pattern meaning from this particular distribution to this particular distribution and i can find a unique sequence of moments that determines this and this is another unique sequence that determines that right and as soon as this is set right and then what i need to do is to work on this system right and then i just need to study the steering from this meaning this sequence to this sequence as soon as this is done then actually you are able to do this because you you write this as a sequence you write that as a sequence and some of these and then apply applying the moment control back to the back to the orange whatever system you have you can you can okay so this is the last topic that i wanted to talk about uh this is uh data-driven learning and inference so this is our recent work in networked inference right okay so here's the problem so if we have a network right and then we have a time series recording for each node right so for example if there are 100 nodes and then we have 100 i'm serious recording and given this data can we recover the connections can we recover this topology over time right because the coupling strength between nodes could be varying over time right so so so can we actually from data can we infer time varying connections of the network and can we learn spatial temporal information and can we discover dynamic structures meaning for example synchrony and can we learn um the model right so these are very interesting questions that um that we could ask okay so our approach is actually very simple so it's based on it turns out that this can be done by by a kind of regression right so so this is the generic model that we we can see there but actually so here this one hypothesis the hypothesis is that so this is the dynamics of each node and the dynamics of each node depends on its self dynamics right so this is the self dynamics and the coupling dynamics meaning so for example if if you take three nodes right so x1 evolves according to its own dynamics plus k12 k21 the effect from k1 to k2 1 and k1 3 and k31 right so this is our general assumption right so you have a network and the network is uh is related the dynamics which is related to itself dynamics and the coupling dynamics okay so now that i so we wanted to given data for x one x two and x three so given three times zero theta we wanted to infer these coupling functions as well as these right so the mean no note that the coupling functions are actually time dependent so because these these are these connectivities are are changing with time okay so the idea is very simple so now i'm going to take this coupling function of two variables i will expand this by using an orthonormal basis right so this is a two dimensional orthonormal basis and i'm gonna expand the natural dynamics f using just a one-dimensional orthonormal basis meaning for example if the system is oscillatory or periodic right and then you can choose fourier expansion right so the idea is very simple you take f and then you just expand this by using for your expansion you take k i j you expand this by using a two dimensional fourier expansion right and as soon as the the bases are determined actually if you plug this in and finally this is the dynamics right so this is the equation x i dot equal to this right and because we have already chosen those basis functions meaning for example we have already decided to use fourier two dimensional fourier and what remains to determine would be this coefficient right so anyway so we can decode actually this problem into so for each node i can write this into just these are very simple least response right so if you are considering a huge network and actually we can do this in parallel so the estimation of for each dose for example now if i pick this node right i wanted to estimate uh all of the connections into an and out of this node as well as it's not self dynamic right so for each node we can decode this into a very simple regression problem right and then we can do this simultaneously meaning in parallel right and right so this is our y is actually the data that we have and and this a matrix is the matrix containing all the bases that we have chosen meaning the free fourier basis right and then z is the coefficient that we wanted to determine and then we just uh basically we're just doing the data fitting right so this is originally a linear estimation problem and then we can just turn this into a very simple linear problem and uh and i'm going to show you uh a few a few uh simulation and experimental results right so here so this is just a test bed right so we generate synthetic data we generate fake data right we know the solutions and we apply the technique to do the recovery and then actually this is um yeah so of course we can get a very accurate result this is just to validate and then let me show you this so this is a case where we start this social synchronization so the idea is that um we actually put uh so my collaborator so he he took uh five months into one cage and could house them for 65 days and then he did seven of these and then he wanted to study weather these groups of mice are socially synchronized after after this uh actually 78 days first right 68 days so he wanted to understand whether they are socially synchronized right whether meaning whether they like each other right and actually the idea so is to to look at these through their temperature rhythms so so they put mice together and then he collects locomotion data activity right and then that would turn into the temperature variation so whenever he sees that after the co-housing their local locomotion activities and their temperature variation uh are kind of synchronized and then they conclude that this group of mice is socially synchronous right so what we did is that he collect all the locomotion data and then also the temperature data times years and then we use those data uh to recover the network right so for example there are five mice in a cage so then the there are five nodes right and then we use the data and then we recover the networks right so we have four cases of connected networks we have three cases of not connected networks right and then so our conclusion then we can okay so these are synchronization index actually our conclusion was that these four cases are socially synchronized while these three cases were not right and actually this matched their experimental observations and this is another experiment uh from from uh dr herzog so again we start the uh circadian networks right so actually he so this is a he gave us a network of 700 nodes okay and then we wanted to use the oscillation data to infer the network topology over time right and then from the estimation we can identify hubs right so the these dots represent uh those nodes that are highly connected right and okay so this is actually the left hand side brand the head left sdn and this is the right hand side brain so the idea so actually in their hypothesis the connectivity within this brain or this part of the brain is stronger than between right so and actually we identified that so we we took the data we recovered the network topology and then we observed that within within the the left-hand brain or right-hand side brain actually within the brain the connectivity is greater than between and um so we also identify 14 halves on the left hand side and 16 on the right hand side so of course i mean nobody knows whether these are correct uh answers right so they actually didn't know uh where are the the the hubs located right but at least we can identify okay so when we do the recovery actually we recover the clock as 24. so this is one thing that is very good very close to 24 and then we also identify that within within this or within this the connections are actually stronger than between right so and then we are continuing doing this uh to identify actually what are these hubs right so those are called vip cells okay and then uh yeah so this is this is our ongoing uh research so so again so you can see that so these these sales are actually more important in terms of triggering staccation reasons and and what we are trying to study is that if we have a network of we if we have the data can we use our algorithm to locate uh these important nodes right and then in order to validate whether this this uh estimation is correct actually the in experiments like my collaborator he could do that so for example he could take away a few nodes he can remove some nodes and then we do the estimation again and if the nodes that are removed after removing some nodes if the network is not synchronized anymore that means that what has been removed will be this house right so we can do this by actually uh one by one because i mean in experiments i think they can they they cannot simultaneously shut down or remove multiple nodes right so we can do this one by one and then we know that as you can see more important nodes are actually in the bottom of the brain yeah so this is ongoing uh work that we i'm doing with my neuroscience biology collaborators okay so i think i'm done so this is uh this is my concluding remarks so i wanted to say that uh actually to tell you that controlling collective behavior and engineering dynamic structures meaning synchrony right would be really a very very compelling task in many many applications right and the many problems are really unsolved so i i skipped through uh all of those math parts but but there are many new problems there which are very difficult to be solved i didn't have time to talk about that so there are still many problems if you are interested in this area there are many theoretical problems there are many data-driven problems and and and data-driven method seems to be the right way to deal with this problem so like indicator yes types of data that that we can we can use and and we do not really need to know the equations right so we just have we just need to have data and then we're trying to use the data to learn that okay so this is my group and the work that i have already presented uh many of those were done by my students my postdoctors and these are my collaborators and thank you for your attention thank you for your talk for the definition of when a system is controllable you gave that it could be moved from one state to another any given pair of states but i imagine that there's other criteria that you could want to have to make a system controllable like you know the seq you know the sequence not just that it's feasible uh so you actually have it in hand or that it's computationally tractable or that you have to can do it with some noise in the system so you are talking about the moment i guess i'm trying to map the theory to and practice how how would you go about using the theory to find actual ways of controlling the system okay so that's the definition right so now you have a system and then your state actually the states are functions functions of your data so beta could be like so the idea is that you wanted to steer this function this population requires this configuration so the the definition is that actually if you specify so this is your tolerance and so you especially find an initial pattern you specify a final pattern and then you actually consider any any you can for example if you if you look at those animations that i have done so for start to maple actually there is some tolerance that so for example as long as i can make the pattern very very close to the shape within this arrow then that is that is okay does this make sense you know that you can do this so if you specify this error you know that even within finite time you can do this yeah so that is the definition of controllability so in the example right so that is a 40 40 seconds right so that maple leaf so so i i specify the pattern and then uh right so here i actually specify i i consider this system and everything is set up right so i wanted to do this this and now i specify that i wanted to reach this in 40 units of time and of course if you change this time if you make this shorter and i guess your amplitude has to be larger if you make this longer and the amplitude could be smaller right so this is set and then i designed this based on this criteria target the path you mean the path in between to the trajectory to go there see that is another that is yeah another problem but but the animation that i showed that is to reach this pattern within 40 minutes in minimum energy yeah so i can i can yeah so i wanted to do that in the in the minimal energy perspective yeah and and then you can also you can also try to find another criteria for example you wanted to switch this pattern to that pattern given even even a certain energy level you wanted to reach this in minimum time so there are many different criterias that you can access because you can just allow you can just wait forever and then probably yeah uh defining controllability you had a field that it's operating within as m um is that m assumed to be constant in these models or could could that m also potentially vary with some other variable like time or something like that yes the slide you just showed us this slide yeah you define the the vector field or or however you want to describe it as m the space you're operating within uh no the the field itself if you look at the the bottom left figure the right above that that m so meaning your system is living on these things right so then do you assume that sort of the shape of this state space you sort of draw it as having some some shape to it oh so this three-dimensional and then this m so if you consider two-dimensional a plane okay yeah so this is just a so then my question is uh do you assume that the way it's going to navigate through the system the way the system is going to respond at any time point is constant so this is this is like the space where for example uh what is a good base space for us so so for example yeah uh i think that that is um that that is just a space where your system uh your system is evolving on and for example if you look at this if you look at oscillators right so if you look at oscillators actually the this and the m is just this circle right so in this case specifically do you assume that the frequencies are constant examples yeah i can hear the following i can see here i take four hodgkin classic neurons and they have different frequencies i know the frequency so that frequency is constant uh so in actual biological systems that frequency might not be constant so how do you plan on evolving the model towards that sort of a system where um the the state of the system might not constantly be constant right so that's that's really a very good question so if i do this i need to make sure that everything comes right and then i design it worked for this and for example if i designed this and just saw that when my systems are coupled and they are evolving and then the frequency is drifting and the frequency is changing and finally i will not be able to the aggregated feedback is very very useful so if you can collect meanwhile when you have the evolution if you can collect measurement data and you can use that to to
