and i'm really excited to uh have benjamin garcia uh here so professor ben garcia is a is the chair of the department of bar physics at at washu and he's a raymond witkoff distinguished professor and before at washington before that he was the presidential professor uh at upenn and before there was a faculty in princeton when uh as when numerous awards which will take me 30 minutes to go through but some of the coolest things he's won or he won the nih new innovator award the picassi award the presidential early career award for scientific scientists and engineers he was a sloan fellow and he's also a fellow of the royal society of chemistry and uh when venezuela has done some really cool work uh using mass spec to study you know epigenomes protein modifications on his stones and i'm really looking forward to your seminar okay thank you very much for that really kind introduction and the invite um to come share some of our work over the last year too that we've been able to accomplish and what i'm hoping to do today is give everybody um you know in the first half of talk kind of a crash course or update on some of the technologies that we've been developing over the last few years and then kind of second part of the talk we'll focus on how we're applying these technologies to understanding epigenetic mechanisms in a very specific sarcoma cancer and so just to get everybody on the same page with regards to background i know not everybody studies chromatin or epigenetics that's okay nobody's perfect just kidding but we have large amounts of dna and the way that nature kind of is able to take this dna and put it in a very small area in the nucleus is by wrapping the dna around a ball of proteins called histones and about 146 base pair of dna will complex with two copies of the four core histones and make a nucleosome that's the basic repeating unit chromatin and the nucleosomes will be connected together some will be in more densely aggregated regions versus more open regions of the genome but ultimately this will make our chromatin fiber in our chromosome and these histone proteins are very important to this process and at first it was thought that there were more structural proteins involved in just you know the structural aspects of of chromosomes but then you know researchers over several decades have discovered that these systems are highly post-translationally modified and in fact you know the modification kind of landscape of these systems is is quite immense and i would probably go on a limb and say that they're probably the most highly modified protein in the human body um and so here's the the four core histones h3h4h2h2b and the linker histone h1 that's in between nucleosomes and you can see here there's many different modification sites spread across the histone and you know this is probably out of date by now because this is several years ago but it just gives you an idea of all the different modification sites there's some sites that have multiple types of modifications that can be found and as you can see here the chemical diversity of these modifications is quite high you know definitely things that you've heard before you know phosphorylation or methylation of lysines things like that but there's a lot of really interesting modifications that have been found and are continuing to be found on histones such as adp ribosylation sugars and a whole series of fatty acyl modifications and these modifications um that um many of them not all of them but many of them are on the n-terminal tails that stick out of the nucleosomes these n-terminal modifications um have been linked to gene expression patterns and so again you're kind of seeing the core histone tails in cartoon form with some of the more abundant modifications that you'll see and in general histone acetylation has been found to be linked to gene activation histone methylation it's a little bit more complex it comes as monodye trimethylation so different degrees of methylation and it can be linked to gene activation or silencing for example lysine 4 methylation is found on the promoter regions of active genes on histone h3 but if you go a few amino acids down the same type of modification lysine methylation is actually on k-9 of the same proteins actually found on the parts of the genome that are silenced and so it's not only the modifications and what type but where they're at on the sequence that really matters and because of kind of these relationships um many theories and you know kind of hypotheses have been put together to try to understand how histone modifications affect gene expression patterns and one of these is like the histone code or just on ptm code type of hypothesis that basically says that these modifications act as a binding platform which recruit other proteins and this leads to gene activation or silencing and in support several proteins that bind specific histone modifications have been found and these are kind of like some of the first steps that will then turn on or turn off a gene and histone modifications along with non-coding rnas and dna methylation make up these epigenetic mechanisms and epigenetics kind of refers to gene expression patterns and cellular phenotypes that can be passed down from one generation to the next and then not you know not require uh any type of underlying change in the dna sequence so there's no dna mutations as you can imagine there's a lot of areas of biology that this could become really important um especially developmental biology so if you have a stem cell and it's gonna convert to many different cell types and tissues organs and a whole organism epigenetics has been shown to play a big role here in you know control the gene expression patterns to differentiate cells to different lineages but there's a lot of real interest in understanding epigenetics and human disease as well and that's because with the huge amount of genomic sequencing data that's been coming out over the last several years many mutations to histomodifying enzymes proteins that interact with histones or even the histones themselves have been discovered and so there's many companies large companies that all have epigenetic oncology divisions where they're creating kind of small molecule inhibitors as kind of next generation therapies for various cancers and other disorders and there's just a lot of interest in understanding how epigenetics may play a role in different biological processes as well and you know that your field is is a really important one when it makes it into the really um uh you know blockbuster movies and so what you're seeing is a picture still uh from one of the spiderman movies from a long time ago so there's uh you know the board is full of all the um science and math that you know required to create a superhuman spider and if you look at the board you'll see a lot of things that are familiar but you'll see something right here that looks uh very very familiar at least to me it does it's a nucleosome with histone h3 k27 trimethylation on it so whoever's in charge of this cord knew that you know epigenetics was you know just a really important field that um probably plays a big role in obtaining human uh superhuman powers there's a lot of different ways to study history modifications um traditional approaches with sex-specific antibodies and so these are antibodies that recognize you know more or less one site at a time however there's issues right so when you're doing western blots you often see multiple bands that it can recognize and that's cross reactivity so the antibody may not be super specific and it's a big problem with histones because a lot of the histone sequences are very similar and highly modified so you often get cross-reactivity that occurs but a bigger issue is what you really don't see and so here's a peptide elisa assays you have these synthetic peptides they all have serine 10 phosphorylation there's a monoclonal antibiotic recognizes that serine 10 phosphorylation the last two um peptides have a modification right adjacent to that phosphorylation and the antibody is really great at recognizing phosphorylation by itself but has trouble recognizing the duly modified peptide and this occurs in vivo and so that's why we kind of uh favor using mass spectrometry analysis and i think it's a little bit less biased approach and we can do things you know much more quantitatively than uh with immunoassay or antibody based type of methods and over the years my lab has been developing a lot of approaches for um just understanding a lot of different aspects of histone gtm biology trying to make these um analyses a lot more quantitative and high throughput you know trying to understand which combinations of modifications occur together um you know how fast these modifications get put on and off of the things that we've been you know coupling mass spec with and um in cell labeling as well as coupling you know genomic approaches with mass effects to you know mass effect readout to try to get to um you know looking at your favorite gene um and the proteins and system marks that are present in both healthy and disease states so i'll talk a little bit about some of this technology we've been developing first kind of our approaches uh to look at the combinatorial histone ptms that are present and so um you know from our data and others one single histone modification site almost never occurs by itself it's always in combination with something else and this is important because certain modifications have negative or positive crosstalk and so for example arginine methylation on histone street actually inhibits the enzyme um methyl transferase from methylating k4 on the same protein whereas arginine methylation on hysteresis 4 actually stimulates acetylation of some residues that are downstream and so there's all these different kind of hierarchies and relationships that biologists have been chromatin biologists have been uncovering over the years and so this brings up a really great question right because you know if we take the common proteomics approach to look at histone modifications and here's a sequence of histone h3 and if we digest it with that enzyme that will digest into smaller peptides we can detect a lot of these peptides and the modifications on them but if you ask me well do you ever see this modification with this one i can't tell you if i ever see them together because i lost the connectivity once i digested the protein and since many of these modifications turn genes on or off um this is a really important question that um you know needs to be um you know studied in depth you know do you ever see antagonistic modifications together on the same histone tail or which combinations do you see together and is this really a code and you know you think of a code is there some kind of way to interpret this code and so um you know over the years we've had many iterations of developing you know just different chromatographies and mass spec based approaches so that we can get to the the end point of looking at you know the first 50 or 60 amino acids on the histone tail and all the different combinations in quantifying detecting quantifying all the different combinations of modifications that occur together and so we you know just kind of show you a little bit not going to get into the technical details but you know we can take a histone such as this nice three do a separation with uh you know this kind of um newer chromatography called hillock that we've kind of developed over the years um and it separates out the histones by their ptms and that allows us to then uh select certain modified forms of the histone uh for uh fragmentation which will allow us to get their sequences and at the end of the day you know for one kind of peak here we can see that this is the major histone code that's present with the multiple combinations of modifications um at the different lysine residues and so you know we've been able to kind of do these experiments but as we're generating this data what we really want to understand is which system modifications really don't care if they're found together or not and are kind of independent which ones have kind of um you know interdependency or positive interplay they like to be found together which ones really do not like to be found together and so now over the years and looking at you know many different cell types and conditions and things like that we've now found you know that there's about 2 500 histone h3 forms across three different variants um and there are certain modifications that really like to be found together and other ones that really do not like to be found together um and several rules and hierarchies and you might think 2500 is a lot of forms and it is but theoretically it should be millions um and so you know there's definitely rules and hierarchies that have to be obeyed um and that now we're starting to and i'll show you in the second half of the talk that uh some of these really do matter these combinations of modifications together do matter another area that we're just trying to increase um or enhance is really the throughput nature of these types of analyses and typically the experiment is that you know you take your histone or any proteomic sample and you separate out the peptides by some kind of liquid chromatography usually c18 reverse phase into the mass spectrometer and in our hands this ends up being kind of the bottleneck because complex proteomes usually require long gradients you know two to three hour runs to sample everything um you know if you have a bad sample you just ruined your columns so that's going to ruin the run um and let's say i have a 200 samples i need to run the chances are i'm probably not going to run them on the same column i'm going to have to change out the columns and this is going to create batch effects so for us you know we're always wondering well i wish we could get rid of this type of step and just spray directly in the mass spec and not have to deal with this headache because also hplcs are finicky as well and so we decided to do that and so we use this instrument called the nanomate which is a direct injection instrument it picks up a sample about you know one or two microliters and can spray it for even up to about five to ten minutes at a time but what we decided to do was not just spray in a sample but also tell these hybrid mass spectrometers such as an orbi trap fusion to do the separations in the gas phase because we're kind of getting rid of the separation and the liquid phase so we're going to lose some resolution but these instruments have multiple mass analyzers and functional other optics that allow us to do some types of fractionation in the gas phase um and so um you know we decided to do a proof of principle experiment where we took bsa we digest bsa with tips and and if we run it by like a 30 minute 40 minute run with a nano lc liquid chromatography and get about 70 have 70 percent sequence coverage of bsa then we know that our sample our our instrument is ready to go that's kind of our qc and it's ready to go let's system stability and we're able to run and so we took the essay we digested it and then sprayed it in the mass spectrometer for about 20 to 30 seconds and just let the instrument do different separations of the ions in the gas phase um and what we found is it got 61 sequence coverage without even optimizing so that was really kind of very um encouraging and so we decided to make um kind of a gas phase fractionation scheme uh for all the histone peptides that we're really interested in and so you know we kind of know a lot of these peptides or at least their families and we can kind of estimate windows that would include their modifications and we're going to allow the mass spectrometer to kind of do the separations in the gas phase of these different masses rather than try to get liquid chromatography separation of all these different peptides um and there's you know things that we have to do to just increase the signal because once you lose liquid chromatography you lose a little sensitivity so there's things we can do to kind of accumulate single signal in these different parts of the instrument but at the end of the day we did a proof of principle experiment this direct injection of a sample versus our nano liquid chromatography you know 90 minute run we took a peptide library that has synthetic histone peptides of different types is probably about 75 peptides in this library and we ran them both by the direct injection and the normal run as you can see here most things are pretty close in intensity there's a few things that are outliers for sure but what we actually found was that the direct injection actually gave us a little bit more accurate results and that is because with liquid chromatography there are some peptides such as these k4 peptides a lot of histone h3k4 glycine methylation peptides that don't stick very well into these columns and so sometimes we see them sometimes we don't uh but with direct injection there's no columns so we see everything um and um you know we took a brain and liver sample from mouse um you know real sample um our normal nano lcms 90 minute run versus um you know our i didn't go over his acronym but basically it's direct injection mass spectrometry for 20 seconds the same sample and what we get was really really similar results and so now we're getting to the point where um you know we can run you know 3 400 samples a day i don't know if we've really hit that many maybe just a few times but we have the capability to really go into large scale experiments go into clinical samples and so i think right now we're at a really exciting time that we can quantify you know depending on the cell type you know somewhere around 150 or so maybe a little bit more histone ptms in less than less than a minute lastly technology wise i just want to talk a little bit about um you know some work that kind of is is outside the epigenetic realm but you know it's still i think very important very interesting and that's rna biology and rna modification so obviously there's a lot of different rna modifications that have been popping up over time and now we're starting to see that these modifications have definitely um biological function in various areas of biology and disease and the one way to look at rna modifications is typically with next generation sequencing approaches however with these um modifications um oftentimes you either have to use antibodies to select one of the modifications and enrich for it before you sequence or there's some kind of chemical kind of indirect method to detect the modification and so we always thought well mass spectrometry would be great to be used to detect rna modifications um and so we take a rna sample and digest it with an rnas um and ran in the mass spectrometer in negative mode so there's a lot of technical issues here but we kind of worked out things over a while and what you're seeing here is the lcms run and every little spot here is a rna peptide of different sizes evoluting out and we're able to optimize the fragmentation of the rna species typically they're anywhere from like you know six um to maybe like 30 uh ligon nucleotides long and if there's modifications you know we can detect those in the mass spectrometer we did have to create a new computational workflow for this because there's no like shotgun rna omics kind of software out there to be able to do large scale types of analyses of mass spec data on rna you know fragmentation data so that that was kind of something we really had to put a lot of work in but we now have a nucleic acid search engine and this allows us to kind of map all these little spots and sequence them and say oh yeah it's this rna this rna with certain modifications and so this is kind of a screenshot of one of the data sets so you know got pretty good fragmentation of the rna species you know we have modifications um you know they're very easy to pick up because they give us these mass shift changes um we're able to detect i don't know somewhere around 30 different rna modifications pretty easily um you know we still have a long way to go with this you know typical sequence coverage is like 40 to 60 which is kind of low um and this is because we just need to find more nucleuses or better combinations of new places or something like that because there's a lot of sequence space that is not quite covered really well especially if you have like you know several repeating units of the same um oligonucleotide um and so uh you know but it's a start and we're pretty happy with this um that we're able to do this there are i should say there are two programs out there that kind of can take one spectra at a time and you can map um like rna modifications with these one spectra at a time work engines but ours is literally like a large scale kind of uh engine where you could dump a whole raw file with you know 100 000 spectra in it and get back on your data but you know in kind of comparing what we're doing to the previous examples you know we're doing a pretty good job so you know we get a lot more spectra identified and a lot longer length oligonucleotides identified as well um so this is kind of a first paper on this new area in the lab that we hope to keep kind of building on but i think it's one that is going to be really important and hopefully mass spectrometry will kind of be seen as a very competent complementary approach to other rna sequencing approaches so now for the second part of this talk i just kind of want to speak a little bit about how we're kind of using that technology especially the histone ptm technology to really try to understand um you know a very specific type of cancer and so um for the last uh few years my lab has been really interested in soft tissue sarcomas and so um sarcomas are pretty rare uh tumors of mesenchymal origin and so you can see how rare they are just by comparison of the u.s breast cancer incidence or lung cancer incidents versus the soft tissue sarcomas and so if you take a look at the y-axis you can see that breast and lung cancer just you know way more frequent cancers and sarcomas but there are a lot of very different types that have been identified and these are affecting a lot of patients so you know these are important um you know types of cancers to study and you know just because something is rare you know not that frequent it doesn't mean that it's not important um and so you know obviously it's going to be important to the patients that suffer from these rare cancers but it's also um you know an opportunity to really learn more about some of these rare uh cancers and you know the common kind of mechanisms that can occur and in many sarcomas um there are and in many cancers as i kind of mentioned before there's a lot of mutations in chromatin modifying enzymes and and interacting proteins and so two of the complexes that are highly mutated um across many cancers are the schweissniff and the polycomb um uh group of of complex and so you can see here the swiss smith highly mutated it's probably one of the more highly mutated complexes across many different cancers polycomb as well is highly mutated especially in a lot of blood cancers and these are kind of antagonistic in in a way functionally uh proteins and so polycomb contains an enzyme easy h2 which methylates histone h3 and so typically this is a silency mark and it keeps kind of a closed chromatin gene silence so you can imagine if there's a loss of function mutation this may lead to a more open chromatin so why sniff is the opposite it's an atp dependent remodeler and so it slides nucleosomes around allows access to underlying dna needed for transcription um so it keeps an open chromatin but you can imagine that's why sniff you know loss of function mutation could lead to a more repressed chromatin and so you know these are probably the most well represented of the chromatin um enzymes that are being studied in various different cancers um but you know as i mentioned in mesenchymal tumors there's a lot of different types of a very interesting kind of chromatin abnormalities and so we do see the the schweissnift loss of function or even gain of function polycomb loss of function we see that as well there's a whole host of sartacomas that have many different types of rearrangements where they create fusion proteins and some of these will fuse like a histone acetyl transferase to a transcription factor a d-methylase to a transcription factor and in many cases it's not really clear what this view how this fusion is driving you know um like the cancers there's even um mutations to the histones themselves and so in some bone cancers you'll actually get you know a histone where there's like a lysine mutation uh to a methionine and all of a sudden you wipe out uh methylation at that lysine residue um you know in in these cancers so there's all this really interesting kind of you know chromatin biology that's being disrupted in these various cancers one of the soft tissue sarcomas that we've been getting really interested in is malignant peripheral nerve c tumor mpnst and so as its name kind of um implies it's a sarcoma of nerve origin peripheral nerve origin it's both sporadic and syndromic and so it can kind of progress from a related neurofibroma or it can just kind of sporadically um uh you know um occur um it's a pretty rare tumor you know probably looking at several hundred cases a year something like that but has very poor prognosis in children in fact you can see there's less than fifty percent five-year overall survival rate um you know not a lot of options to treat patients as many of them are you know poorly chemo responsive um and so you know surgical um surgery and and kind of radiation are really the main staples to treat this type of cancer there's a lot known about the factors that can drive it so about 50 of them of the patients have a mutation in one of the cyclin genes and so that's kind of a one set of npnst but about the other fifty percent have a mutation uh to soothe twelve which is a component of the polycomb repressive 2 complex and i mentioned this one before this complex before right um this is an enzyme complex it methylates hysterone h3 this is a silencing mark so you'll get this on and find this on sun the parts of the region the regions of the genome that are silent that are not expressed um and in fact because of this it's histone h3k27 is what is used in the clinic to kind of um you know separate out um different types of npnsts and so here's an mpnst from a patient tissue sample that has a polycomb retained and so it has a different mutation and so you keep the see the staining for histone h3 k27 trimethyl whereas here's the npnsd that has a polycom loss and so you do not have the h3k27 trimethyl and you can see that you lose the stain and that's what kind of pathologists use however k27 trimethyl is probably not the best marker for this or other cancers and that's because it occurs in a lot of other cancers and so it's not specific to this one cancer and in fact there's some cancers such as melanoma that you know are actually at the pathology level similar um in scope to mpnst and so trimethylation is really not a great marker to differentiate you know some of these kind of closely um not related but closely pathology wise i guess closely related types of cancers and so as we kind of started off in this project you know we kind of had a few different questions one we know prc2 is the major loss right it's a loss of function mutation we know k27 trimethyl is going to be decreased um but how does this prc2 loss further affect the epigenome you know how how does that reprogram the rest of the epidemic you know how does it respond to that so we're going to use our histone proteomics type of technology to try to understand that um additionally um anytime you're affecting the epigenome you know you're gonna affect gene expression you're gonna affect protein expression so we're gonna use quantitative proteomics kind of little standard approaches to understand which cellular pathways are affected by the prc2 loss and this was all driven by a resident pathologist postdoc fellow in the group john wosick and at penn and many other institutions once you have tissue sample that has been taken from a patient oftentimes they're stored in these tissue banks but the one issue is that they're stored as a formula and fixed paraffin embedded samples so they're these little kind of samples embedded in wax right and cross-linked and so there's you know ton of these at penn my former institution when i was there and so you know john had to really kind of convince himself that he could get high quality samples out of these wax kind of uh stored uh samples you know high quality proteome high quality epigenome histones um and so he really worked hard to kind of optimize you know the proteomics from ffpe samples and so he took a fresh piece of liver and then he formulated fixed perfect embedded a piece of liver and extracted out the proteins and just a really quick run showed that he can get about the same number of proteins which is great and the abundance of the proteins are about the same you know there's maybe a little small decrease in abundance of some of the lower level proteins in the ffpe sample and that's because you can't fully crosslink or reverse the crosslinks completely in these samples so it is a little bit low a slightly lower quality but you know we were pretty happy with these results and you know from fresh to fix you don't really get a loss or a bias in anything right you don't see your main brain membrane proteins or nuclear proteins being lost you get a little bit of loss of everything so or very very small though um so we were really happy with this and john went back and then um you know and did some examples and did some tests of how far back can he go in terms of storage samples and so and i think even went back about 12 years um and you could get very very similar numbers of proteins now with a little bit longer gradient you know deeper proteomics get about 5000 proteins or so pretty easily and their abundances were all very similar so we're really happy with this data from you know real ffv samples and then with histone modifications if we took a we took that fresh and fixed liver sample um and just looked at the top you know 50 or so you know 100 or so histone marks very very good correlation between fresh and fixed tissue and if we took cells from patients that have the mutation versus the ffd tumors from patients and looked specifically at the k-27 modifications the methylations very good correlation as well so we thought we were in a pretty good position and should be able to get high quality data off of this and so um john did an experiment where he just took neurofibroma uh the npnsd with polycom loss or the amplitude with the polycomb that's retained as you can see there's something very different about the npnc with the polychrome loss and here's a volcano plot of the polychrome loss versus the polycom retained mpnst samples as you can see here we do see the loss of a lot of the k-27 methylations which we would expect it's a polychrome loss um these are kind of shown here for k27 dimethyl and trimethyl neurofibroma polycomartain polycomb loss we can see for the dimethyl for the trimethyl huge decrease in those modifications um and a lot of them are found with k36 dimethylation so this is the silency mark this is an active mark so that was really something interesting that specifically we saw the loss of um this dual mark together um there were other things that were lost too though so i mean you can see here besides the k27 we lost k20 and then we also gained some things as well just on acetylation k36 dimethylation by itself and so these are the the things that were upper regulated in the polycomb loss so a lot of acetylation as well as the k-36 dimethylation this is active mark these are all active marks and in fact a lot of these right here in a circle they're actually histin h4 acetylation so you have lots of different combinations of histone h4 acceleration that occurs in the polycom retain here's like the normalized level polycomb loss you get an increase of many of these specific combinations of acetylation on histone h4 and so a little bit deeper dive into the k-36 methylation uh data we can see like i showed you down here before we we can see these peptides that have k-27 mono dior tri with k-36 dimethylation together and the polychrome retained the levels of k-36 die with either unmodified monodire trimethylation levels are right here and we see a good spread of these different k-27 methylation with the k-36 we have the silencing active mark together but in the disease state you lose the k-27 you basically have k-36 levels by itself um with the k-27 this is the unmodified and so what this data was telling us was that in the normal state yeah parts of the genome that had k-27 methylation you have parts of the genome that k27 and k36 and other active marks together but in the disease state you lose the k27 and you have just active marks kind of overriding um the really interesting thing as well is that we actually found that k-27 dimethyl with k-36 dime trimethyl are good markers even better markers than the k-27 trimethyl alone for mpnst so here's a polycomb retain sample we see both the k27 try and die polycomb loss sample we lose both of them and not only do we lose both of them this is really specific for mpnst i mentioned that there's a lot of other different cancers that lose k27 trimethyl but a lot of these other cancers such as glioma and epidemiomas these don't lose k27 dimethyl only mpnsds loose try and die together a lot of these other cancers may lose try but you'll see that a good staining for dye so john actually uh started you know going back and and trying to get uh pathology labs to use both of these markers now instead of the single one and so we were we found out a lot about the epigenome with our quantitative proteomics approach um we actually saw that you know you go from a fully signed state to a more active open chromatin state as kind of shown by the histone active marks acetylations and k36i methylations that increase in abundance but what about the the protein what's affected by this and so doing quantitative proteomics you know top five thousand proteins or so uh here you see a volcano plot like gold chains polychromos or polychromatin so these are all the things that are gained um in the polycomb loss and you can see these are all things that are either related to cancer growth um or things that you know are not fully unexpected um things that uh maintain an open active chromatin or active transcription and so the histone mark data told us you go from silencing to open chromatin and the proteome data tells us that yeah we see that as well you know swiss sniff and other proteins that maintain an open active chromatin and transcription that are upregulated as well as you know things involved in cancer progression however you see that there's also a lot of proteins that are down regulated too and so what are these well these are all proteins involved in the immune response you know interferon signaling mhc protein complex presentations and you can see this in the data real easily if you just look at the mhc proteins class one class two um in the polycom retain you get signaling for all of these there's a different patients so you get signaling for a lot of these but the signalling the polycom loss patients is much lower and you can see this bird's eye view just by just you know histochemistry of hla molecules you can see in the polycom retained you get the signal polycom loss you lose it same thing here the signal's a little lower to start with but you see the signal here and you lose it over there in the quality and in these patients that have the product lungs and so you know although we go to open state and there are you know chromatin proteins and growth factor signaling that is upregulated there's this whole uh repertoire of immune signaling molecules are down regulated and this is a really interesting observation because you know how does losing a repressor like prc2 lead to more repression you know how are we getting repression of these to start with um why aren't we just getting runaway transcription you know everything going up that that more poly prct was is found and so john looked through the data really carefully and saw that there's a protein dmnt 3a that was upregulated as well and this is a dna methyl transferase and so if you look and after we did by solving sequencing of um samples we can see that the polycomb retains cells you have a certain level of dna methylation the polycomb loss it actually goes to a hypermethylation state which is consistent with upregulation of the enzyme responsible for this so you can see that here in the polycom retained you have a low level of or a certain level of dna methylation and then blue indicates a higher level of dna methylation in the polychrome loss cells and if we look at what are these genes that are found um on the on the promoters and enhancers uh this this methylation um these are all interferon and um you know the mhd presentation so it's everything we saw before in the proteomics data so this is kind of the mechanism for why we're getting uh you know down regulation of the immune system is that dna methylation is actually increasing so it's compensating for the polycom loss um and is making these um you know these patients more immune compromised um to allow for the cancer progression and so what happens if we can manipulate some of these pathways and so you know at least in cells we can restore polycomb right so it has a sus12 it's mutated what if we added a suse 12 that was active again um and what if we knock down some of these uh enzymes that uh increase uh um you know the the active histone marks here such as nsd2 which is a k36 k-36 methyltransferase k-32 dimethyl is upregulated in the disease state but if we knock it down and what if you use dna methylation inhibitors as well and so i mentioned that you know the mass spec data shows that the silencing mark k27 dyer tri is found together with k-36 dye so this is a normal state and in the disease state you lose the k-27 dire tri and so you just have the k-36 by itself this is the disease patient state um what happens if we can restore the methylation here or if we can further remove the k36 methylation that's what we'll try to do in these the cell models and so the first thing we did was actually added back sus12 um to the patient drive uh cell lines and so you can see that we can lot and from the control we have sue's fall back it's really interesting if you ip for easy h2 one of the components of the polycom complex in the um patient drive cell lines that have the suits 12 mutation you can never get back the full complex and that's probably why it's compromised but if you add backseas 12 you can then ip and get back the entire complex and of course if you get back the complex it's functional and so you know you can see that k27 mono die and trimethylation levels all increase um you can knock down nsd2 so here's nsd2 and we can knock it down it's the k36 methyl transferase we can knock it down and get to this state as you can see the knockdown reduces the k36 dimethyl now if you do quantitative proteomics um of the whole proteome from these two states that we've manipulated this state and this state that we've manipulated so this is the sus12 ad back or the nsd2 knockdown and kind of plot the data that are differentially regulated by these two different types of enzymes we can see that they're the same proteins or they're very very strong correlations and many of them are the things we saw before and so indeed we see both k27 dye and trimethyl on the same genes with regards to cell growth if we knock down nsd2 in polychrome retain cells it doesn't really matter they don't care they're not very sensitive but if you knock down nsc2 in the background of the polycol lost cells um these cells um you know have a a cell growth defect we could play some other games too instead of knocking down the enzyme we could actually remove the mark by putting in this histone h3 uh k36 methylation transient so it can't get methylated um and the polycomb retain cells so these patients have these cells have a different mutation um it doesn't matter you know if we lose the k-36 methylation levels um you know it doesn't really do anything to cell growth but these cells are very sensitive to losing the k36 methylation levels uh by doing this very similar to the knockdown of nsd2 um using a dna methyltransferase inhibitor i mean this is you know this is a big hammer there's a lot of dna methyl uh transferases that will affect cell growth so if we you know use increasing concentrations of this dna methyltransferase inhibitor to npnsd cells with polycom retained eventually you can't kill the cells but you can see how much more sensitive the cells with the polycomb loss are to the dna methylation inhibitor and you can get re-expression of the interferon genes by you know adding this dna methyl transferase inhibitor to the cell culture so you can see all the all the interferon and immune system um proteins coming back and there's you know this also will end up causing uh re-expression of um endogenous retroviral genes as well and so with these manipulations we're learning a lot about the system you know um you lose uh k-30 k-27 methylation you have open active chromatin the genome maintains this by upregulating proteins that are needed for this and to drive transcription however at the same time the patients are being immunocompromised because dna methylation is taking over and silencing genes um that are needed for antigen presentation and interferon response unfortunately you can't do a lot of these things in a patient right as a treatment right how do you you know restore function in a patient and there's no nsd2 inhibitor present presently available um there's the end of methylation inhibitors though um but you can't kind of do these as a treatment of patient it was a good academic exercise exercise but not for patient treatment um but there are other histone marks that are changing too and specifically acetylation you know went through the roof in these cells and dna methylation and histone um diacetylases do share a shared um mechanism of action so we thought maybe this could be something to explore and the idea was that you know in the polychrome lost cells you have high levels of histamine acetylation what if we just drove these two cytotoxic levels by adding an hdac inhibitor um and so if we take polycomb retain cells look at h3 and h4 acetylation and add an hdac inhibitor kind of benesthetic say you get an increase in the acetylations of both um polycomb lost cells already have like a higher level of acetylation even compared to poly um the polychrome retained cells with the hdac inhibitor which is pretty interesting and then when we add the hdac inhibitor those levels go through the roof so we're definitely getting to this area so what happens to cell growth this is the last slide i'll show you of data and i'll wrap it up so if we have a polycomb uh retained cells and we add increasing concentrations of this hdac inhibitor penibenostat here's kind of the kill curve for that these three cells in red have the polycomb mutation and so you can see these are all much more sensitive to the increasing concentrations of anabinostat and in fact you can get the re-expression of a lot of the immune response proteins hla proteins by um addition of this kind of venostat so all these mechanisms are converging um if we took one of these cell lines that um you know had the polycom mutation um and we added sus12 back to it remember we did that before in those experiments now these cells become more resistant to the increasing concentrations of the panabenesta and if we do the the combination kind of therapy add uh increasing concentrations of panavinista and a dna methyl uh transferase inhibitor you can see that the intake the combinatorial kind of treatment um you know kills the cells you know a lot easier um than uh the cells that have the mutation versus the polycomb retain cells and so you know taking kind of a quantitative proteomics approach to look at the histone marks epigenome as well as a proteome really allows us to understand a lot about the system and maybe you know potentially points to a few new areas that could be further explored for therapeutic routes and so kind of in summary um you know prc2 loss you know the k27 methylation is is by far the the largest loss epigenetically but the epigenome kind of is reprogrammed and so we see increasing histone modifications such as acetylation and k-36 methylation kind of re-establish it themselves as well and um along with that another silencing mark kind of compensates for the loss of the k-27 trimethyl the dna methylation and so these might all be potential routes to look at at some point for you know new potential therapeutics but there's still a lot to understand and so you know this is ongoing work that we hope to continue to really try to understand relationship between dna and methylation and histone modifications we have some ideas of what might be going on here um and we think we can get at that with some chipseek experiments and other things and then really this whole you know new area of the immune response you know why are we getting the decrease in immune response um epigenetically is something that um really needs a little bit more work maybe in a mouse model we now have a collaborator that has a mouse model for npnst um because it may be uh the combination of epigenetic inhibitors with a you know immune response kind of um inhibitors checkpoint inhibitors or something like that could be the route to go in the future so with that um just want to thank all the people that are involved in different aspects of technologies always had a lot of great students and postdocs over time and staff as well and just you know singly um uh you know single out john wilsich who did a lot or most of um the the work with the npnsd cancer as well and funding from different sources thanks again for for having me here and i'd be happy to try to answer any questions if there are any thank you great thanks ben that was an awesome talk so if you have any questions please a mute or go to the podium and like ask them your questions maybe while others are thinking of that question maybe i'll just get the ball rolling i think one question i had was how do you profile like epigenetic drugs like you know you showed panaminostat but how you profile like there's so many compounds that have epigenetic effects you could then see if any of those reverse does the fact that you see in sarcoma or you could profile them just to get the best match sort of yeah you know um well we haven't done that specifically in this um with this sarcoma with this npnst um we kind of just went for you know there are a few a handful of hdac inhibitors that are clinically approved so we you know we kind of went after one of those that kind of been a stat however um you know i've always kind of wanted to go back and profile i mean there's so many different hdac inhibitors and they must all have slightly different you know histone or non-histone targets or you know severity of inhibition of hdax and so i've always kind of wanted to go back and and kind of do a little bit larger scale type of experiment um where we can take something like you know i think uh the company celic offers like a histone inhibitor library maybe has like 200 different compounds of on that or maybe try to collaborate with um you know the um the toronto uh sgc you know consortium you know because they have a lot of other hdac or a lot of other epigenetic inhibitors and really just profile everything to kind of get a really um you know quantitative atlas of you know the different responses um not just epigenetically but maybe throw in other things as well as like cell growth and different types of things like that i think it's a great idea it's just it's a pretty big undertaking um you know so we'll have to kind of figure out how to how to do that do that well yep awesome that'll be super useful though for us yeah yeah hi this is tom carpola uh nice talk both parts were interesting i'd like to ask about the second part regarding the role of prc 2 in keeping interferon responsive genes on which is a bit unexpected do you have parallel patient lines from normal tissue to say whether the prc2 change is in fact the operative difference in terms of uh distinguishing between something else perhaps affecting prc2 and the interference response in parallel as opposed to the brc2 actually keeping interfering response genes on yeah no we don't that's definitely something that if we can get back to it um it's a very good question and it's definitely something we've kind of wondered too um you know wanting to get back to that whole immune response kind of angle that's something that we would take very close look at and if we can get the right samples i think we could get a good answer for that but we haven't not done that those experiments yet it's really interesting i guess as a follow-up you mentioned the question of immune function in sarcomas is there enough data to say that actual interference response gene expression in the tumor has uh has prognostic importance in terms of the the sarcoma i mean is this something that actually is a is is is a pathological mechanism yeah i don't think it's been well studied i mean from the few people we've talked to in this area um it's definitely not you know something that's on people's radar yeah so yeah no remains to be seen thank you i think carolina had a question yes uh hello hi dr garcia thank you for your presentation i have a question so you mentioned you know the the right limiting step was the lc which indeed is the case um but i have seen other approaches where they replace it with immobility are you planning to maybe use some eye mobility in the future i know at some point there was like not a lot of software unlike there were some uh duty cycle limitations but there are many labs now that are using um uh like the team stuff for proteomic uh gradient so i was wondering yeah so um yeah it's a really good question we've already tried some iron mobility like fame's like in the front end um you know i the the hope i think for us was really that we were wanting to um without the liquid chromatography the worst thing for us is that there's several peptides that are like isomeric modified peptides that have like multiple lysines so you'll get one peptide that has the modification on one lysine the other peptide has a modification on the second lysine but they co they kind of coelu if your chromatography is really good you can kind of separate them so we kind of work at that um but without liquid chromatography now you're just spraying them all together they have the same mass and so we're really hoping that you know the fames we have a fame's kind of source could be you know something that would help there um however we didn't see kind of the separation that we were wanting out of the fames we have not tried something like tim's top or like a real eye mobility source you know that's that's kind of a little bit more outside of what we can do but i think you're absolutely right and um one of the you know follow-ups from this initial work that we did in histones is that we want to kind of do things um at a more complex level whether that's proteome i'm not sure but you know maybe like a fractionated sample or maybe like an ip or something like that and i think there like some type of eye mobility is just like would be essential i think what we found for the histone modifications we can kind of get around it we didn't really it wasn't essential we just kind of um you know can use prior knowledge and some math and we can kind of estimate the modified forms if we have to um but for like a really complex sample you're absolutely right we're gonna need like an eye mobility so you know hopefully at some point someone can kind of couple those together and do it cool thank you any other questions if not i would thank ben again oh brian do you have a question i saw you coming oh no i just thought i wanted to thank ben as well i thought it was a fantastic talk as an old prominent guy it's just just so much fun to see how this has gone along i mean uh thanks so much for coming to our seminar yeah no thanks brian thanks really really we'll talk and have the power of the mass back you know it's really amazing how that's creeping up everywhere so this should be a vagina it's was a very big interest to us and i hope you're able to visit you know when it one time yeah yeah yeah definitely you know i've actually never been to michigan um university of michigan so it'd be great to come visit one day well consider this to be an invitation and thank you very very much and shiram i didn't want to steal your fire yeah that's what i would have told ben to you know like once things get better you should definitely come visit us yeah sounds great but thanks for having me everybody yeah thanks man yeah all right really great thank you thank you bye
