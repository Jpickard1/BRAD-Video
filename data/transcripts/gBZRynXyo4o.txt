is new to be manager there are some sort of changes that happen there that gamma-gamma all right welcome everyone we can go ahead and get started so welcome to the tools and technology seminar series which just provides a nice place on a weekly basis every Thursday for us to talk about various tools and technologies methodologies that are out there as I mentioned last week I am scheduling for next semester so if I have any volunteers on that certainly makes my life easier so please let me know if you are interested there are still some open slots there is a sign-in sheet that's going around if you haven't signed it yet please do so before you leave it just helps up the pizza helps us know how many people came how much pizza to get and justifies our offering pizza and of course we wanted to continue to be able to do that so today I am pleased to welcome our speaker James yang and he is the associate research scientist and School of Nursing thank you oh that pedals a I'm talking about g1 study and you can use T us to do a lot of things but I only focus on very small research question that is for multi bar between no text and the name because of my department did not has and you want to identify our socio so it's called I remember your topic genes okay okay I'm a research scientist a scone nursing but I'm my PhD in statistics so mostly I work in going on research office my primary job is totally web grants all faculties in school nursing so basically I just help them to doula and proposed a darkness and a power a sample size calculation tool that I also have my own research so this is part of my research a native app grandfather because I call I with some investigator in G was 30 and I found this is an important topic that's why if welcome you know I work for okay I work I quitter in 2002 for universal for that by 2002 after I graduated I work for honey for Hospital in Detroit for about 10 years after learn I worry so when I was in Detroit in her naval hospital I collaborate with doctors in in the hospital American they also work on you know Quinn's so I I did a consulting work like that yeah this is a method so basically today I'm going to cover what is she was and then because I'm the region so I work with state as I've talked about a data structure and the research question after that I would deal a lot to a quick review for existing methods and Americas so Cucaracha was study you need at least two different data files why is genotype data Yara is the phenotype data for genotype that I usually get that from you know running sleep away so for example you want was your cell you have cell phone and you you call geotag orange for contour on that you don't have calling then you have a like this one work Thank You array so each column represent one in the video it's low represent one sleep over marker and the data are usually coded as zero one two has a number of reference alleles you also a locator on occasion file so Fung on Empire you know know what the ribbons Rio yes so you can know much no time but when we do an S which I look on this data file its genotype file and your journey no not now individual is in a scale thousand so N is a power of thousand one two thousand but a number of snips is you right now usually in one median so this world this is table will be very very long okay so this is a June 3rd file and then you will also have a phenotype file so if I usually determined by your research question or County second you want to do so you acrylic individuals you know Democrats power power and I lost these status or other things so I arranged as you know in the video an individual one phenotype the other okay so maybe case control studies okay if we just did a case control study for genome as the field highs during one part because you need to spend so much money on no it's cheap so you will create more and you know like many many variables and in our study were more than that so the question is can you find out associate between your snip and there you are phenotype the simple question is if I only have one phenotype then we call social studies she was or socially it took final association between your sleep and then a phenotype so you have two vectors final association or correlation so it's a very simple but even multiple multiple phenotypes so its peak now can become multi by where then you want prepare the associate between each one and the multi viral and the soul she was a very simple just file to 1 at R into 1 million heist so Before we jump into any specific agenda usually when when it is for me to to achieve our study I will consider three things one is how to mark all know how to model parasitics to test our association because because we found a mother to have a good property because and based on her type I'll come back we may use different settings and then we need to to build a model that can have a good power compromise the diva power means that if less than anything any signal we can find it and then the other thing is computation efficiency this is usually a to modify because we are now polar univariate or coming it's very efficient Abdullah g1 study it's over out here but modified phenotypes everything all good and you know you need to do the inverse call a commencement so when an umpire multi-value increase the commands measure is increased and then you need to track your back little function even you use a new term option is just X a long time if one test takes one second consecutive very fast but you need to do 1 million times you won't take apart 11 days sort of runner has sorry very not very efficient and then sometimes if you do consulting work you know you do that you haven't a later they say I want to change it on set off you know test we give some quiz you need to back end so you need to consider computation in Fitness I will tell you like this next time and then once we have some secular findings you want to be able to interpret results interviews that you need to interpret is out that your customer can understand not just you so because well now when you enjoy you like Affymetrix or aluminum a 51 6 has 1 million cynics for many marks usually last you know enough because we don't need to have more than London is needs so usually just buy a commercial away so you cannot do anything change unless oh you want to do very specific research customer already otherwise modulus or you cannot change it but you can change you can you tell me your outcome be noticed and it's me he often says that it's very common to have a mouth modified we know that for example like hypertension's you can measure SP bdbb and for type it is usually about major glucose level or hba1c and in the last study i i'm working on sometimes appears like a nicotine dependence or alcohol dependence they already want desire a questionnaire like usually about six questions you know for subscription and asked patient to respond what kind of symptoms or kind of you know how many cigarettes you smoke so if this one is about six to ten and therefore an ass 30 this one published in natural in 2010 they is a print and there they study one to you in the seventy no times yeah I think Stella ballet is a rock yeah so you know you can have a fun to two hundred depends on your study by Rocco is very common to have about six to ten how comes and so we want to talk to a quick review about you see he met before I jump into my proposed meter so I just use the simple bivariate data as an example to explain that you can ease extended to you know multivariate primary you have at least three conditions so it has twice or even are continuous or what is continually is paranoid or normal above and for continuous variables how can you tell the bacchanal um Unova we used you never use ANOVA for money but we use manova oh you know anova in you know undergraduate city of course so this is just you know manova is easy to do and i've a source software out there just wrong it is not very powerful because it some chemin de actually we did a simulation study shows that the manova is not very powerful compared to the other methods and perform when actually the correlation between phenotypes I'll come along I'm negative but in part is usually your outcomes are positively correlated yeah you are apart when we did a similar just thirty you know we just follow you are not going to thank you they are tuning to Z Z or have to be party meeting questions but in this case with is G and we just first I did I'd run a simulation to see how could you use T do not control top on so is very powerful parties for this a lot of false positives I found actually found a paper in to learn about more than 10 years ago nice day see mister did not control type one error rate so who is good party you know he's not the comparison so the principle component as I bring people to that idea is that you should modify penalize you convince your self motivate you not to run variables so yeah you can use principal component you will pick the first principal component come by let you have unis become variable then become the traditional you know she was study well now come to Victor was me but you know all our camera Bihari correlated otherwise you were lost in for there for a second force no principal components pick the first one you lose the information ignore all the remaining two second 30 you become go back to the original question and there's a test that's just you know use the p-value sophomore I want to put too much but it's just you can't go to look at this paper finally one continuous let what is too naive treat the panelist continues so you still can do that skill a lot but you just you know the model assumption also you can dichotomize the containers apart to binary so you only have four combinations for combination you can just longer like more multinomial order equation or human logic depending how you want to model and so it's simple Farah and I think equation approach because by very viable you just you know the composes the Bible into marginal and the contingent or the product marginal continued tribution for which you can moderate the distribution based on Tara sorry so not become easier so either conditional on condition continued another marginal condition or continued condition are discrete and marginal binary I miss it's good but this cannot be extent will be more than two because you are more into you have minimal conditional distributions so it's relative not Amidala Oh Minnie Minnie collision and the other is datin by Porsche ladies you are soon yeah also there's a data map or condition on this our observed data Morocco the reservation alkyne is independent so khadija defenders assumption be imposed on them and then you can continue on that you can be compulsive become a product of loss of animation the Christian Foley support metal is that is actually in this paper they should not let is other viability issue you cannot you get identify those things so let a map or sometimes no is it Co to interpret results and for mix the outcome you can use that can you can use the Twitter or by bus continues or Takayama dichotomies all into binary or later map or however I was seeing the structural equation model but had assumed you know complete structure I don't think I chose assumption based on your data okay so here was my approach start with a contains viable economy by a binary only many ways tend to Mauri Mauri for binary you have to be very viable so for each one each why poor and is snape you you can and once you can calculate a correlation horse of him and get Peabody if I just treated as a stress evidence for the other margin available margin of ANOVA and a sleepy look another Pima okay you can use just use correlation for say we usually try to try to like to use the equation so one uncommon sleep equation one another thing of all the questions you can add our demographic variables to adjust for notes purpose you have two P values and then you want to study the college or such a between those how come in Berlin if I just consider continuous non decreasing combination function here I propose to use the feature combination function just mass to log P mass to log P values in service association this funk a square distributions or some cuss cottages so this is classical dispersion but the issue here is that when y to local Bible are correlated so well so this they are correlated so lady now follow follow a simple chi-square some classical distribution one way to build value to run a permutation test formula power individuals in an origin and clear reference distribution value think about you have 1,000 oh they went on individuals so they can consume and usually the significant level is usually not point oh five in ten to minus six so you need to run from religion more than 10 to minus six ties to have enough accuracy to as many values and at end of suppose as 10 to 6 and x 1 million times that's the time you need to of course can you adapt your method to by stone high consuming so all to do is that when I look at and now then okay I'm there nor as an oscillation this actually follow a cottage fusion okay we scale chi-square some old dependent a squatcher follow conversing with two parameter K X and sketch it parameters even that mean and velocities as two unknown parameters so all go is if we can estimate K next we know the distribution of this then we can calculate P of T yes this one this one is not also not accurate the matter even for small sample size for this participating because we know we talk about a song about one meet 1000 symbols us month on month or so on enough passes you kick in the central amazing so this one you will be high school high school now if you just you know they're dependent chi-square so some end cut square gamma is a confirmation to model latter like you say no more some normal assumption you know if you will follow normal I say it's a normal distribution it's not your cell is a possible body very accurate but cuz okay how to say no in fact Oriole story fascination factorial step is a passing bus very accurate Aryan style you have least two unknown viable sample size you know because they are some of the square so they are mean in a balance okay alright so la Provence because what is that option of a collision between the phenotypes so you cut to a simple calculation this is one so let's just give a no no no correlation between phenotype you can you may call it a curate these values and even for different value of Rho for mass 1 to 1 the value of commands Peabody okay party rock of hours 15 value attacker for echovirus on this one okay Kevon so so you look at is is no you need to oppose me with the point Omiya so I type up as Mary I just you know numerical puzzle so I calculate pointer coefficient loss polynomial and the difference between all familiar and the exact no value calculate from the previous Kofi's this is a point one so it's very accurately I mean let me because you calculate the was another number is a plus two times this so all the difference here's no Nick rapport so if you have low cohesion so summarize my problem is you can target margin or P buttons for its outcome you can do multiple come but you can estimate collision some phenotypes then party to in peanut wrong coalition to this one and again the previous two unknown equate these two equations we can estimate canis so you know distribution on this one so you can calculate p-value very serious corruption costs I'm treating the correlation matrix to a higher moment browns correction is to take that chi-square scale it back and beyond the correlation no not always right so the first simplest correction I brought is to scale that back see see categories I told you gamma let you skip high school no no so - because secretly have to Chi square only has one parameter and then see the also there are two parameter their equipment who knows to give you to a calculation so still have two unknown seek at school the same lesson this one I use gamma because actually the equipment to scale chi-square 1970 I think I recall a paper curly because this is based on very simple theory of means that you know for a samosa are normal for cost is because of small sample size so let's divide this as T cities and actually the body was very cost and that's the first thing they only consider crescendo up to 0.001 now at least not many turns that's the first thing the second thing is when you consider chivas usually you know have a similar site about one town and so no more sunshine school now so I mean we can try the cost method as a small similar plan I don't see any differences I just knew my quarry there's no difference no need no need you just you just you know money on things oh no of it fit polynomial tourist barrio and this man is calculated fun this good when you say correlation you always assume beanie accommodation there does consider communication but phenotype the phenotypes if you have numerical representation they may not always a uniform distribution you have to rewrite so like people's height they are not just uniform so how can you assume a linear correlation so that's why I said you know you find correlation between this one or not but you need to think about dispersion of y1 to determine which function or which that is to use to calculate correlation sometimes you need to do like you know low cost oxide or square root transformation for calculation over you can use the non primer to see that Kendall Tao to see that you know concordant discordance corrosion do you have numerical trick where you could transform them phenotypes value so that they are they have bettered numerical property yeah like in machine learning to use sigmoid transformations [Music] yeah I will show you you want to calculate p-value so we just use the continuous we chose to transformational outcome variable to make it act normal ya know most reservation you can do that okay for binary of courses you just as you so jittery question and and usually about too much because you apply simple so you can do a possible you know good transformation to care a good approximation and then the second is to cut your coalition which or you can use non biometric to take a collision I will say that when I don't have saw means the same compiles a parallel combination no one 300 totally yeah just expect so you know say forest is 10 so any questions so far have many many then here becomes correlation because of us oh yeah how many turned then it's summer paralyzed so I think you are I don't catch the first two moments so let the extension to pioneer canoes so I can consider two Bibles only one can is one bearing and no way I was at y1 and y2 what is binary but we assume here as it is I assume that this is de Parfum latent variable so I used fresh home Otto Otto it's an air bubble yeah one was your depend on underlying you know latent variables then can is given you still can calculate people Fung you know can use of binary outcome so voice equation and not useful question get p-values okay now you can still get a city's 40 question is when we consider continuous case we use coercion in order to estimate continued phenotypes which I just like this why to it divide found this victim by about W and if we want to estimate correlation between y 1 and W then we can use the previous myth but we want to estimate is you know observation y1 y2 use of resume you cannot ask me found no major poll data so 100 years called Pearson proposed by serial creation so this combination between just want a step by step I go from lovely - mine - this one like you alright from why to the step function binary binary values which are so that this binary value is divided from W because we use that as a vehicle to derive our model a serial correlation only applies to yes serial correlation is desired to put two days because this actually would estimate college and between what I wanna know i I think I'm stupid less sorry the collision of latest careers should be larger than this one okay so reverse it so we have this coalition parties the real correlation between observation this is our vehicle and because we're talking is so but if we use this Collins to estimate this one actually we overestimated real pain so I just longer simulation this is when y 2 continues corrosion couples and this is one finally one continues that will be smaller cars but if we use is we're over a smile appear so it will sacrifice any real power if we use a larger coerce pasta is that we will increase control of a behavior because we still you know larger and we won't have a party under one so gentle you know it's very stressful you special model then the same almost kind of viable continuous we can use Pearson collagen powder I got to candle at how it's not magic in the end for serial chess with binomial can use they may extend now if you have a binary binary you you can use petrol car wreck and the ordinal continuous is posterior for occurring okay hollows correlation estimation method so I run a correlation from balance point night to a point I and then what careers use Kendall is very accurate and even for Carrera Panamericana is Audino yeah looks good Oh binary binary audio or Dino Dino I mean look I'm estimate as the main method based on those proposed you know existing methods is quite good under this condition so we just bogeyed knows matter and the land covers even if they were overlap of course and then the worst case is binary this is the continuous but we the Ryoka Vance is smaller so we all use a larger one towards the mirror so finally that's the method and then the following are just simulation and I really darkness so any questions just use a genetic model the phenotypes do is follow monomial with minor allele frequency point one point four point five and then genetic model with sensitive active or dominant models for effect size genetic effect and then for Gina effect size zero means no offense ask our model emphasize and I would have considered contingent panel I saw contain this is a victim phenotypes and then we have low continuous here okay so this is well under no appearances no effect size at a point of us again level so so for people minor allele frequency in the collision between phenotypes this is our proposed method and here we compare that with permutation method because it's a simulation we know the value of data mapper so we also run not to see as this is a constant and a best-case scenario and I know they all cantata by all right next one I'll show you a more stringent papaya and the laser is the same under the hip hop again if our size or Tiffany passes and now you can see that first the pie hat depends on your exact size you're not really powerful and a pop quiz when a minor allele frequencies increase that's why you know evil is very rare you know we note the genotypes the frequency it's very difficult it is a lot of samples to detect at I mean even the phenotypes way you know homogeneous nah very heterogeneous so I could see very small in that situation you need a large sample sweetie take this mo matter $1 1,000 you just see receive 1,000 there are so activities usually I use 1000 and this is a proposed measure and a permutation and the purpose is very cost to permutation with because we actually have you know to model a permutation distribution using common education and this is the best casual saw I say Smith Allah has smaller power then we almost a little power compared to permutation recall so you know we use the larger no covalence estimate but now I thought in another it's very very much analysis under the other scenario so here we can see the more about the case with mixed scales so in this case this V not hugs to all continues to binary to audino's and this is stricken ten demands fourth tab on your rate so no even sighs so analytics that means we just use the you know copy what the continuous variables notice I'm reserve use the W here for data and Alex our proposed method and NYADA to is chicken Street every purpose continues by balls you know this one is treated you know just dichotomies every by pointing to binary and romance for and and that we just we try to come back underlined 4.5 we've always point nine [Music] this is not very large a point three five and four power is you know this offense cases you know so no one's your period and the almonds there because to that and then of course it will just is finally or which is power not that is casual it is a power half and finally Rio de Donna's we use sage data study of addiction Ginetta environment is a typical typical data from a question of twist studies so fun district 30 and the total sample size about four thousand thirty but we only select unrelated individual not duplicate because they want to do control so we can remove one over it and then appear open there's a policy about 100 family data so the majority are independent individuals so we use independent individuals and then if the individual has no phenotypes we also promote at individual so the remaining is 2000 1775 and if they use alumina 1 million away so it's 1 minute extender we did a quarry control like hardy-weinberg are you put in test and minor E or frequency so enough panel number is seven thousand surrounded by 53,000 its names so we use a few have six questions on this this standard test or nicotine dependence so there are six question one is how soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette so as a zero one two three four or do you know how long and then second question is to find difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it was forbidden binary variable is also binary which secret with you head wants to give up and the first question is already know how many cigarettes protect or you smoke your larger number of Monica it will be nicotine dependent addiction so love is to smoke Norfolk initiative in the first hours after working and to smoke if you are solu or not you are impaired was of day so the only a seclusion in the line for cognition the you jury will get a some score from first six questions and Christian will make decision based on this number only sought determine if they are good and present color point six so if you are six or more you are more likely to be immigrant depress so they will give you different you know treatment some answers and as I found zero to ten and many some studies just use this total score binary to run analysis but we think we can do better by using the first six together so that separation between those six you know questions so it's found point four four two point seven seven just pairwise correlation are you scandal is kept you can use spirit because something a finally out you know so I just use no managed taking an idea about collision even if you try to the other collision major well be very cost so it's a simple distribution first six question and then total although it's funky or to Tampa no one is you know getting the ten days ago so the auto night first imported fusion and the last one card point okay sweetie marginal taste for each outcome by ball in the snip but we also will use the question depends on you know all continuous or binary penalty equation and and we also pull a Democrat very powers such as age gender race into a jazz follows three democratic purpose and this is a trivial part so this is what it's observed p-value is inspected p-value is back and all I even attack on a means of the primary because my step 10 so no larger means the smaller p-value so it is I mean is that's most likely to be significant so seeing that now not many are insignificant and if when we use multiple the combiner plus 6 and ok and if we pick 10 to minus X color point you have to pick one let me leave first question identify one snip the yah the questioner by the Alice need nan blows identifying is need an even real binary only identify the same one as FK n t1 ok and there are purpose Mesa combined 6 phenotypes and other past 9 snips region basically different different chromosomes hello yeah hello how can the same so sure they are all smaller than this one we do not check so the conclusion which one do you think two snips make more is more reasonable and nice next we don't know actually this is a report or a study because we just find some say so that we can publish it as a weed dealer compared to a fire to cook too much impact to see you know has been published I do find someone in a publish in the other paper but not on it so maybe that means that almond I mean maybe something nummies um maybe we just first part we don't know I'm too duelist pieman too light and very valid so wholly Papageno alliances incidentally for mixed scale phenotypes okay and we should we really thought about already and now we have good power and proposal to that a marginal taste because you can do module test intensity and even if we want to do multivariate test it will increase some like proportion knowledge polish or to a number of phenotypes but we because you know when we do a test we just do a modification passed marking tape or lookup so it's very fast to calculate a p-value of a proposed suggests using stage shows that combining multiple phenotypes can increase the power on the that's why is usually follow customer lat a Republican gene that contribute to a common liability for complex disease because sometimes Leia want you to see a set of phenotypes there were some hypotheses about you know not structure of laws phenotypes or sometimes not psychiatry or psychology they they they thought somehow you of characteristic cannot imagine you know by one by Bologna's or they don't major set of variables they want to studied the collision between the set of laws viable and loss no variables here see so Allah will help them to interpret our result thank you [Music] thank you uttanasana wait actually I have a lot of power by all method manova have the power of Messer not only me party on the paper SOT compromise so well-known many papers check in manova as a standard and mono bizarre power two third to half of layer other methods so mono mine are very powerful
