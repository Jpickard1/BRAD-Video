I'm going to start recording okay um so let's take a quick look at these results um so as to the question do you use internal standards in a typical targeted metabolomics experiment if so how many um internal standards do you use um the most common answer was six to 10 um I with second place being 11 to 20 so so it looks like we've captured a um a moderate range um there were um a number of responses that said one as an answer which I expected to see um relatively few use um over 20 or more than or even more than 40 internal standards as to question two for an untargeted metabolomic experiment the most common response um was two to five um so the number of uh that's interesting um not not unexpected but the number of internal standards um in a uh in an untargeted metabolomics experiment actually works out to be lower um than in typical targeted metabolomics experiment um makes some sense because internal standards are um really uh widely used in targeted metabolomics they're a little bit more uh variable and untargeted but there were responses across the range um question number three what do you currently use internal standards for um we got a good number of responses for all of the um all of the potential answers um the most common uh response was um Quality Assurance quality control to assess a stability of retention times um looks like the next most common was a two-way tie between absolute quantitation and um assessing chromatographic performance um but all of the responses aside from other got a fairly substantial um response to that um When selecting isotopically lab question four When selecting isotopically labeled internal standards which isotope do you most commonly use dyum carbon 13 or some of both um this is an interesting question and I've seen various results to this survey and I think we've more or less reproduced those results here today um I so that the majority of responses at 43% said primarily carbon 13 but dyum when necessary um only 9% said exclusively carbon 13 um only 7% primarily dyum carbon 13 when necessary and 7% exclusively dyum um and then and then a substantial number um I um 15% said mostly use non- isotopically labeled internal standards which are another valid type of internal standard um what is the most important factor in your selection of a specific internal standard um it was a two-way tie between isotopic Purity um and availability as my preferred isotope with a close third place as cost um when you um when do you usually add internal standards to your experiment um most we got a substantial range of responses but it looks like um to the sample dissolved in extraction solvent was the most common um I um I we left that as a multiple response available because many Labs will do that at multiple points in their experiment and I think the results reflect that um uh okay as far as question seven which should have read what are the greatest challenges facing the field um I the it was a two-way tie between unavailability of specific compounds in isotopically labeled form and a need for more commercially available internal standard M mixes or uh uh or uh kits um which I think is really interesting and something that we can uh we should discuss in our um discussion today it's on our list of questions um great well I hope this was a um an interesting and informative um set of results um for you I um I am going to leave those results open on my window um if you would uh um like so others can can view them I'm not going to stop sharing but I would just recommend if everyone wants to move them out of the way um so our speakers can share their slides um let's move on um without further Ado to our panel discussion um and we are going to begin uh with um so just to review our panel M members will provide a few key perspectives and they have devised a list of open-ended questions to facilitate disc um discussions at the Pres their presentation end so um in spite of the fact that this is uh so we'll leave it up to the individual speakers if they want to pull the audience um right away then they're welcome to do so um but um in general to keep things moving I thought we might hold our questions or even better um put your questions in chat as they occur to you and we will open things up to a all panelist discussion first um before we move into some of our facilitated questions um and I've asked Tim to be monitoring the chat window as we move through um so he will be um and we've got a fairly large group so when we get to the discussion um I think what we're going to have everyone do is when you've got a question um I post a question in chat or say you'd like to make a comment and Tim will call on you um you can unmute yourself um as we get further into discussion we can adapt that as we need to all right so without further Ado let's let's um start um I've asked Lor suner from University of Merc Missouri to go first all right and you have my slides and you're going to start okay all right so our instructions were to be to have one or two slides so I put together a couple of points on what we're doing um I'm kind of going to be very basic uh as the introductory speaker but U essentially we use internal standards uh in our lab in both targeted and non-targeted uh es in a non-targeted approach I've actually put a listing of the standards that we use uh and typically these standards are in our extraction solvents and they help account for recovery and Matrix effects um I'm old uh and some of the standards that we use come from the older literature uh specifically I think I saw alliver on the line but many from the max plank so especially for the gcms for the lcms we use a plant natural product called enveloper uh it is a plant plant natural product so you have to be careful what systems you you use it on so it's not a universal one but in many of the model systems that we work with it's it's just not present at very large or below levels of detections and we also use longchain alkanes and or fatty acid methyl Esters uh for pretention indices calculations for for gcms as well so we are using internal standards in our non-targeted approach and then we use these to assess quality next please so next animation Charles and we use them again to assess Char uh performance and this was part of the questionnaire for retention time checks for intensity checks but we also use these for normalization of the data post acquisition uh to help additional uh type of uh alignment of those um next please um but those are we also use uh external uh standards for more rigorous type of quantification and the standard is you you generate a calibration curve with the authentic standard uh for external calibration and then you get a more rigorous quantitative number next please but in our when we want the best precision and accuracy for targeted type of mrm type of analyses we do use stable label um we prefer C13 but we will use du rate assuming that there's no back exchange but these internal standards uh especially the label uh allow for recovery and Matrix effects uh to quantify them and in a more precise Manner and then finally next please yeah so and then often postacquisition uh we typically don't have to but if we have a need to cover a wide dynamic range we also begin to use U waiting factors for our internal uh label as well and there's specific uh uh citation there and that just gives you better Precision over a larger dynamic range next slide please so uh I just wanted to give you one example of the stable label and type of targeted effects that we use um this is an analysis for kerine which is important in cancer uh as well as chronic kidney disease uh so typically next you can actually just go through all of them uh we will generate uh standard curves external curves using kerine stanyard and then we'll add a internal label compound to that mixture as well and then we actually monitor the ratio of the label to the unlabeled to account for again for for Matrix and Recovery effects and by doing so we can get very highly prec precise quantification uh via this method and if we have to and we have had some need to on some of our target analysis again where we have a high uh uh dynamic range we will use waiting factors uh to adjust that calibration uh curve uh to give us again greater precision and accuracy so um one of my questions was what are you using and we'll eventually get to that but if you want to start putting that uh information in the the chat that would be nice to know uh what other compounds people are using for labeling so that's my two slides in three to four or five minutes work so perfect thank you Lloyd um again I I I yes we're we're we're in a rapid fire format here so um I hopefully um we're we're generating thoughts in your minds our next speaker will be um Christina Jones um from n and um take it away Christina okay hi everyone um I'm actually to split my time talking a little bit about what we do at nist Den metabolomics um and then the the mqu Consortium and so at this we kind of divide our work into two different categories and it's measurement science and measurement services and so our measurement science metabolomics work leads leans to our biological and en environmental applications and so we do use internal standards for both targeted and untargeted studies and so you know for our targeted work we use internal standards to compensate for any sources of error that's introduced in Sample preparation as well as um analysis um processes and so in our untargeted work we're primarily using internal standards to ensure that our analytical methods are repeatable um we use them to track chromatographic performance and then um to make sure that mass accuracy is maintained as well um for the past few years I've been more involved in our measurement services for un targeted metabolomics and so typically just even beyond omix that that includes calibration standards used for SRA ability and complex Matrix standards and so it's on the slide here is just some of the complex Matrix standards that we currently have under development for metabolomic and so you'll notice that these um don't include um isotopically labeled internal standards and so um one of the questions I had one thing that can be discussed later is if um reference materials either with pre-spike internal standards could be useful or needed um or whether you know more commercial um internal standard mixtures um are needed for untargeted metabolomics and so you know our reference materials are typically used for longterm um QC or used as long-term QC samples to assess um interlaboratory study data as well as just inter study data within your own lab and so we can go to the next slide besides calibration and complex Matrix standards we also work with um different communities to develop reference methods and um start developing best practice guidelines as well and so a number of our n metabolomic scientists are actively involved in the metabolomics quality assurance and quality control control Consortium or M Quack and so it's just a community-led initiative um that was was created to develop and promote QA and QC and untargeted metabolomics research and so mqu has a few working groups two of which relate to qaqc best practices um one of those working groups held an interactive Workshop yesterday during mana and we can go to the next slide um and so mqu members who employ lcms um were actually surveyed on their qaqc practices as well as our Quality Management Systems um some of the questions similar to the survey the poll that everyone just took at the of this workshop and there were questions you know that was related to internal standards and so I thought this could be a good form to share some of those responses um this will be published soon this it was an effort that was led by Annie Evans and clar O Donovan and so there were responses from 23 Labs across the globe you know they included Labs from um Academia industry and government um as you can see 91% of the respondents reported using internal standards uh most used internal standards to assess chromatographic performance amass accuracy as well as rela standard deviations they also use them to monitor um instrument drift and Sample to sample reproducibility the number of internal standards used per method very greatly from 1 to 800 um but one to 15 internal standards were um was the most commonly used some Labs spiked in the standards um into the samples before doing the extraction some spiked them into the samples after the extraction um so you know this shows that they're being used but there's not a lot of guidance um or rest practices on how we should use standards which may be needed um moving forward and so yes that's that's all I wanted to share with with my time for now great thank you Christina and again um the speakers have all formulated questions relevant to their topics and and you'll get to see those very shortly um so keep thinking those ideas all right so our next um panelist um is Russ Grant um from labcor who's going to tell us about internal standards in clinical and I and industrial metabolomics type settings you see my screen I'm trying to share a screen fingers crossed did I grab it yes uh good conversation can you see my screen yes yes we can and you can hear yes we can hear you you're doing great thanks thanks um so what does it what does it mean when you're trying to make a decision for another human I think it means a lot um as a basic breakdown of the standard lcmsms or gcms you could obviously convert this uh a pretty standard workflow pretty generic um in our experience internal standard is added directly after a specimen qc's and calibrators and and mixed prior to extraction unless it determined that the extraction step itself does not affect the relative um binding of analy and internal standard it is designed to resolve for the majority of the failings of the lcmsms workflow that follow but in clinical Diagnostics we think about internal standards as a way of Designing out the most variable part and that is the human in clinical Diagnostics and in in lab medicine we're always challenged with the cheeseburger guy that thought it would be a great idea to go and have four Big Macs about an hour before they drew their blood but also putting complicated work those in the laboratory so I'm just going to point out some of the things that internal standards provide for us in an environment where the number Precision um and linearity or separation of disease States matter here's an example of a nstep solid phase extraction protocol performed by hand this is the is scatter on the left here versus with an automated pipetting system and automated postic pressure manifold of course internal standards we can use to Trend across the run but would you trust a result that was generated with this internal standard recovery down here relative to one that was recovered up here we actually have a standard in our laboratory where our Precision or our total error of internal standard needs to be within 25% obviously that makes that rather impossible because 25% of that scatter is a ginormous number okay so they tell us about the longterm the downstream effects what do you think about that chromatographic Peak start there this is homovanillic acid in urine so it's a pretty robust Peak there's a couple of other isobaric Peaks or at least contributors to the transition this is msms data in quantitate in in in Diagnostics more often than not we actually measure two separate transitions for every analyte not full scan product time but two separate transition using a multiple reaction monitoring and if we look at this peak the area of these two peaks one divided by the other it's a qualifying transition this is a quantifying transition that area ratio to a neat standard is within 98% agreement that's pretty good but if we add the appropriately labeled internal standard six carbon 13s oxygen 18s what do you think about this peak now it clearly is not thov vanilic acid so qualitatively Peak shape Peak retention times aberration uh the ability to actually describe the the shape of the analy peak even when transition ratio fails is another wonderfully powerful benefit of internal standards appropriately labeled you'll note one of the things that that we like about Mass spectrometer or in fact external calibration and internal standards that that Lloyd pointed to is it is by definition or reference method procedure but we should never forget the fact that the interface itself is not an equimolar ionization system I'll make the point like this and this is a drug I understand it's a drug but I only had seven days lead time so these were already approved slides so forgive me but this is a wonderful experiment my colleague here at lab cour Brian rapold showed so this is Gaba pentin and it's d10 10 uon internal standard spiked into urine and this is a fast separation about a minute separation they calute and the mean of 150 samples of a onetoone mixture of these two in previously screened urine is 100% slowing that separation down of 5 minutes we see a hydrogen deuterium exchange problem this is the unlabeled and this is the tend duon form and they don't calute the mean shifts the variance increases because those two particular species are undergoing differential ionization conditions in the source moving on I came from a glp world uh in drug development and so I'm used to running a full calibration system at the start and the end of a batch and then using the composite of those two calibration systems as the overall calibration to to actually correct for some batch effect or drift within a batch but if you're only running a single calibration system or run set of samples at the front of a run or a batch then you're actually doing historical calibration and by that I mean you are assuming that the internal standard to the analy addition in the calibration system is consistent through the batch now you could consider that to be appropriate if for instance you're preparing those samples in 15 or 20 minutes you've only really got to generally be concerned about the stability and the Precision of your internal standard pip petting for that short amount of time but in clinical diagnostic setting or even in a setting where small numbers of samples hit the laboratory throughout a 24-hour period nobody really wants to set a small set of calibrators qc's and five samples and repeat that multiple times during a 24-hour period the internal standard allows us to do something a little bit special here's a design of an experiment we do this all the time so we free some alats distributed in concentration we store a set we run some calibrators and the internal standard and we call that data set comparison Day Zero we then store the internal standard under stable conditions that's solution stability no absorption in a container no thermal degradation no hydrogen derium Exchange 24 hours later or even out to seven days uh and out to 30 days 30 Z we take a thir alqua of the sample we add the stored internal standard solution we now have to add them precisely volumetrically relative to Day Zero so there's no calibration when we run the next day to validate this and then you're simply solving for the analy 2 internal standard Peak area ratio using the regression equation that that Lloyd just showed you as an example so when you compare day Zero calibrators samples and internal standard added to in this instance one day later using a Thor sample so this that it both the day Zero and day one samples go through the same three three store cycle so there's no free store variability in the actual assay design stable internal standard stored under known stable conditions and you compare yesterday's calibration with today's materials again this is drugs it also works metabolites I only had seven days to put these slides together and there is a lot more one can do because if you think about it the reference method procedure as as mass spectrometry can be and is this this the value of internal standard correct for the sins of mass spectrometry but again also using precisely prepared um samples from day to day today allows one to use historical calibration and I will um come back to the first thing the biggest variable we have to deal with in The Clinical Laboratory is both the people and every day but also the the patient specimens we get to analyzed and so we use this with automation protocols that are precise from day to day humans are the biggest variable quad erat demonstrandum great thank you so much Russ um let's move along I'll see if I can re share my screen and where is my share screen let's jump back [Music] down all right our next speaker is Matt Merritt at um sorry I from University of Florida who's going to speak to us a little bit about internal standards in NMR metabolomics Matt take it away so this is the only time I get to have a great deal of Pride uh in doing NMR is uh we we uh have well-known abilities to do quantitative metabolomics in a in a relatively straightforward manner the only thing that you really need to do to to collect qualitative data is make sure that the time to repeat for your NMR experiment is known and the relaxation times of your compounds is known if that's the case then uh the the relative Peak areas once you normalize for the number of hydrogens you're looking at um tells you the concentration in a in a remarkably accurate way uh and it's it's been uh shown that this good quality of Mr uh scales across Laboratory in a very straightforward way and so that's something that for targeted metabolomics by by NMR if you've got a certain small set of compounds 10 to 20 uh that that you want to know then then NMR is going to do a really great job for that targeted metabolomics as far as internal standards or uh primarily we always think about a chemical shift standard that's been known since uh they started doing NMR own electromagnets that drifted all over the place and they said okay let's put a chemical shift standard into our mixture or or whatever we're running uh and so uh tetramethyl salene obviously remember from organic chemistry for metabolomics you see DSS tsp are are very commonly used and they all resonate uh at a frequency that's far away from any metabolites um so uh one of the central issues that remains is uh however for us is pH effects and so that's going to come into play most commonly uh in trying to do metabolomics in urine uh because the if you're going to do it from H serum plasma or something like that normally you're going to do an extraction to get rid of proteins and stuff like that in that case you you handle your sample in such a way that it comes down at a at a pH that you know and understand but if you're doing a urine you've got an option and that is uh buffer the urine till it comes to a standard pH and then uh just have everything relative to your chemical shift standard or the problem with that is knowing how much buffering capacity you actually need how far out are the urines that that you're actually taking a look at and so there's uh been quite a number of searches for um uh metabolites that have a good pH dependent so cring is uh one that's that's commonly occurring but it's got a chemical shift difference that is only really very effective from 3 to five PPM uh I Excuse Me 3 to 5 pH units uh not closer to physiological normal phys physiological pH and so uh we do use a variety of different uh chemical shift standards that are pH dependent if you go to a molecular Imaging conference you'll see about 50% of the talks will be about pH sensitive compounds however you're uh you're measuring them so so I won't try to elucidate all the different compounds or name all the compounds that that you could use the internal standards for spiking and confirmation of your ID uh is a little bit different uh for US versus uh lcms or something with a lower detection limit because we actually probably need uh you know a fair amount of compound and and that's a um that's certainly something that that we have to uh take into account if we ever want to order a standard uh but we don't normally need isotopically labeled standards if we can get the compound and put it in that's going to be fine uh I see uh Lloyd asked the question how important is pH monitoring in in non- aquous Solutions if you do like a ful extraction and you want to do uh metabol or lipidomics then uh you'll find to my experience that that pH effects are are probably negligible you don't you don't have to worry about that too much okay great thank you Matthew um let's uh move on uh so um as I mentioned um we invited Alla to talk and unfortunately I didn't give her quite enough lead time to get slides approved um but I just I wanted to open up um all before we move into our open discussion um we had a great talk um the other day um did you want to add any comments um uh relative uh to internal standards and Pharma and Industry um to our conversation before we move forwards uh yes uh thank you Charles um uh sorry I cannot show any slides but I can speak to our general practices uh as um they are relevant for the uh industrial setting and uh um in our work um my group is focused on B market Discovery and Analysis um and we are supporting um uh produ s at different phases in the pipeline uh starting from Discovery ending up in clinic and uh uh we have to use a combination of global and targeted uh profiling approaches and uh um uh I I will start from the initial phases from the uh start of the project and uh um uh going through the phases of the pipeline because we use different methodology and which so for discovery um at the initial phases we are working with uh typically different uh types of materials cells uh tissues biological fluids uh my group members are joking that uh they used to be analytical chemists now they just collecting body parts and uh uh this is uh because we really have to expand type of uh uh human materials that we need to profile and uh the reason why I'm mentioning this is because uh as you can imagine you switch the material you need to do a lot of optimization uh so standards uh are very important for that purpose so the second F uh phase is uh developing a screen and typically screen is based on the targeted method it is biochemical screen um uh where we monitor single biochemical reaction but uh we prefer to do based in a typic screen where we uh have a closer to real life case scenario and as you can imagine the Matrix is complex but we are typically monitoring um two three um uh biomolecules with corresponding internal standards because at this point uh our screening methods are lcms based but relatively High through putot up to 2 injections per system per day uh so um we need to use isotopically labeled standards uh once we select active compounds we have to follow up uh with the fingerprint because we want to be selective we want to understand mechanism of action and typically what we do we do knock down experimenting uh cells get desired fingerprint uh for ideal cas case uh scenario uh 100% selective inhibition and then we uh also may do a couple of fingerprints for undesired uh targets uh that we don't want to hit and then we profile each compound uh that uh uh looks like it has uh good potential and try to match fingerprint and at this point uh typically we run each compound uh at couple of concentrations uh below ic50 above ic50 and this response has to be quantitative and uh consistent uh so uh we really uh need to be um uh at least semi quantitative uh for the desired uh compounds but this is already a global approach so um our Global method has to be optimized to give us semi quantitative approach then uh one we um uh select promising compounds we move into animal trials and typically here we monitor uh biological fluids uh we also look at tissues and we use combination of targeted and uh uh Global uh profiling approaches and then uh after that in clinical phase we also follow up with uh targeted and Global approach combination so um while uh this targeted approach is more or less uh easy uh we use relevant um internal standards um unless they are not available uh if we cannot use them then uh we are forced to uh use Matrix matching uh or uh standard addition methodology um uh or in some rare cases we can use external calibration curves for Global approach uh we really need to um understand uh what we are measuring what we are able to measure semiquantitatively and adjust our methods based on global approach uh so we uh have developed internally mixture of 63 standards they represent different uh metabolic pathways different classes of molecules and typically in our methods they all across our chromatographic uh profile so with this standard mixture we typically um uh can develop a method uh that either has a global good Global coverage or uh can uh focus on a particular class of metabolizes uh and then of course we work with different tissues and we verify semiquantitative approach we have uh come up with uh uh the protocol how we do that uh for different biological materials and then once we um are happy with the method we um uh typically uh use only um uh five in um some cases 10 uh spiked asically labeled uh uh standards just uh predominantly to monitor uh our consistency across the chromatogram uh for retention times and uh uh instrument uh performance but um we use uh some other controls uh like total metabolic uh average uh that we Monitor and use for normalization we use pool sample as our system suitability um and um we run it every uh 1015 injections and also uh we run our standard mix um uh periodically along with the blank and uh uh for Global method monitoring this really um uh is sufficient uh for us uh so um in terms um of um oh uh there is one other application when we want to zoom on a particular metabolic pathway and uh especially in the situations when we have uh we want to monitor Den NOA synthesis of metabolite uh we need to use uh standard isotop labeled material to follow up with metabolic phase uh of a particular precursor um uh so and for that we need uh large quantities of specific metabolites which uh brings uh availability issue um uh because um it's expensive and uh um availability is not where uh it should be uh to our uh mind um so um I think um I kind of covered uh the scope of our work and in terms of the um uh questions or comments um uh of course uh I would uh like to see collection of standards that would allow us to uh look closely at a particular pathway or uh a type type of metabolites like focused collections uh that would be available from the vendor uh for us and uh um uh one um idea I would have to um make this available and uh uh maybe this is uh a good discuss discussion point is uh uh it looks like each vendor that um generates isotopically labeled uh metabolize that we could use they are uh working independently uh they don't have connection so uh we can buy uh some materials from multiple vendors but in terms of variety um this is uh really uh not where it should be so maybe uh in addition to Consortium of scientists uh which are using isotopically labeled materials we could bring to the table vendors so maybe they can split uh these feares of in uh influence and um broaden the scope of uh materials uh that we can work with thank you thank you all and I think that last point is is a valid one and I think we have um uh vendors here uh today um eager to hear what we have to say and and to contribute to discussion so um we have somewhat uh limited time I'm I uh but we really do want to hear your voice so this is where we get into the discussion um we have a lot of discussion questions there's no way we're getting through all of them and that's fine um uh but basically what we're looking for here is um uh for your input on um uh what we as a community can do better based on what you just heard um so uh and if we could um let's try out um putting questions into chat chat window when you have something to respond and um Tim will uh bring up the comment H and uh and unmute you or you can unmute yourself um if we move forwards we can well we'll adapt as we need to okay um so um we'll we'll look at some of the questions um from from all of the panelists and and some general questions we came up with um but uh the first questions on the list um are pretty basic ones um in terms of what internal standards you use and why and then we can uh fold in um do use them for targeted and non-targeted metabolics we already saw some of those results on um on the survey but does anyone have specific comments I um to those questions as to how you pick your internal standards and how we all should be so this is Russ I would just add a comment relative to the fourth one there are very very few software systems that actually do anything m materially valuable in internal standard monitoring in general to make that tactile for the uh for the analytical scientist or the data reviewer um a massive Gap in opportunity and by tactile I don't mean looking down rows and columns for for a number that's shifted left or right I mean literally flagged for you uh we specifically use the technology made by Indigo bio automation that does that uh and they don't pay me anything to say that Al Randy Julian is a very good friend of mine and is in my band can you document that in the the comments uh Russ the Indigo software and maybe a URL link or something yeah other comments Tim do you want to um do you have comments from chat that have popped up there's and I can uh we had one come in about from yine I don't know if uh wants to unmute and ask their question sure um that's you nobody really talked people talked about the general workflow but not very specific matrices right so while I assume that for example abort might work a lot on urine and plasma and Lloyd sna might work more on on Plants there others who have interest in Mouse organs for example so Mouse organs have different concentrations different compounds um the brain is different to heart and whatnot right so how do we get kits of internal standards that have the right concentration for the right compounds and not just blood yeah no so can I just address that quickly if it wasn't clear in my workflow the first part of the very first step of any analytical experim expent be it blood tissue Mouse goat horse or the cheeseburger guy is in fact generating a homogeneous specimen and generating a missable mixed in our experience and we do tissue work as well uh a missable mixed internal standard to analyte composition missable prior to extraction um and in fact any combinatorial problem like a m massively Multiplex metabolomic experiment I guess the question you're asking is can we get a combin a cocktail very concentrated that one could then potentially dilute to the appropriate circulating range in your samples but I think of that of that like a a tray of round fruit and you're always trying to keep the orange from falling off there's just too many variables in multiple metabolomic space but but I get the concept the thing that I wanted to get across was the mixing myability and heterogeneity in the use of internal standards as much as as you I think you're you're talking to Oliver composite of internal standards in the appropriate response or concentrations spased specific to tissues and different animal species um yes and also not only that but also some kind of a consensus or at least some kind of discussion about uh how to Comm move the community forward in terms of which compounds are important for which organs you know let alone the concentration so if I could take a stab at a response Oliver um you know David Wisher in their group and hmdb keeps uh they do relative quantitation or absolute quantitation and I know Tek is now beginning to consider the production of kits and I think that these kits could be tailored towards specific applications and concentration ranges which I I agree is can be a little bit of a challenge uh to figure out uh you know or at least takes time to figure out on your own so uh I would encourage you to to visit TCH and see what they're doing uh these days or or help push them forward are you planning any kits yourself chis no I don't think that any academic lab should make kits um I think this is the myself I think this is the obligation or the interaction of the metabolis community with corporate vendors um who can guarantee the stability and availability of kids over time but that you know that's my private opinion I guess well t- is is kind of a hybrid between Academia and you know commercial type of entity got a few spin-offs but I thought Chris was beer was gonna say I was actually Lloyd I was sort of impressed by um one of your slides in which it appeared that you had a constant amount of the internal standard and you had a range of you were using it to measure and it appeared fairly accurate um I didn't get to study of the slide very long but um but it it appeared that you were accurately measuring over a range of you know maybe um one to 20 down and 1 to 20 up I think that the Karine the dynamic range there was about a thousand or more couple thousand so so Oliver I I mean I understand exactly what you're saying and I understand that if you can get internal standard at exactly the average concentration then you will have the maximal sensitivity for quantification no two ways about it however I think that dynamic range that um that Lloyd showed you know really suggests that if you can get an internal standard in there for metabolomic work where you're trying to get you know a a broad spectrum if you can get an internal standard in there that is you know even remotely within range you can get enough utility out of it that you'll actually get a reasonable result and and I'll leave it there and and obviously we um we make and and we um completely agree that internal standards are the way to go and we believe that you know biochemically complex internal standards are the least expensive way and therefore um likely to be the um you know the most you know uh opportunistic way to move forward you know for metabolomics itself it's just you know if you have to buy these things chemically pure and then remix them you know it's like you know washing a glass and then drying it before you fill it with water why bother it it's just um it it just seems that if we can make mixtures that are pretty close and use them as internal standards your you know your um that that dynamic range suggests that we can get away with much better data than we're currently getting there's a y there's a discussion about deterior versus carbon labeling in the chat and I don't know if we want to raise that as one of the comments to talk about um since we have a number of experts that are in the field for this yeah I I let me just step in and I think Russ Illustrated quite elegantly the the point that you know the chromatography for deuterated compounds is never the same and it's always a potential flaw back when we were doing GC um you know by the time you got out you know past about 15 minutes you know the two peaks were the DU deuterated Peaks were no longer tracking appropriately and so there was a great deal of inaccuracy coming just because of dyum I I really have have personally never liked dyum it's cheap which is why it's used um I I also have something to add to this point um in the past I absolutely resisted uh working with deuterium labeled uh materials um but um unfortunately carbon 13 is not always uh available uh carbon 13 version and also very expens especially when you start using them uh in animal trials so um unfortunately uh uh in industrial setting we had to do uh what we have to do uh to move forward and uh uh if carbon 13 um uh material is not an option then uh we are forced to work with duum um but um um especially in global setting um uh the um uh the value uh that um uh labeled uh material brings uh is uh really uh stability of performance uh because we are semi quantitative we need to make sure that we detect the uh the difference um and uh we do optimize our methods specifically for that and to that regard um we we are no longer running a standard uh metabolic method um uh which uh has the same gradient uh the same extraction procedure um uh we are changing it so quickly for each tissue type for each animal model we have uh maybe not so unrelated versions of the method but uh still different and uh um uh of course um uh it's nice to have a representative Matrix commercially available but for each animal model for each type of experiment we typically ask our colleagues in uh iniva uh biology to generate Matrix for us and we Spike our standard uh isotopically uh labeled material into this representative Matrix and uh um you know look at our uh method performance in that specific Matrix um I I'm not sure how Universal we can make um you know a matrix spiked um and how applicable it will be for um variety of experiments there is value of course but uh there are pitfalls also great Charles I thought these were rather rhetorical questions maybe they self they answer themselves but um do you trust an lcmsms result with everything that we know about the electr spray Source or the apci source and all the weird biology going on to measure or quantify results to make a decision and inform another human being of a life change would you do that without external calibration an internal standardization or another way of putting it is have you ever seen publish the representation of fold changes with analog internal standards using infusion FIA lcmsms whatever that actually are consistent with fold or concentration range changes that you see using the reference method process and I do do asoc carnitines and organic acids and amino acids and uh free fatty assets by gcms and lcms we do all of that work as well and there is not internal standards for all of that I just wanted to throw I think these are kind of self anwering because I've never seen the second one done right well and you also have Discovery research versus you know high level quantitation and so you know in maybe these are T workflows you know internal standards into Discovery platform might be and is slightly different um to maybe Allah who had there was a question about her having 63 standards which seems to be probably on the high end of anybody adding standards for a A non-quantifiable or a untargeted approach versus say one or two that's at it that's a pretty big range just for measuring compounds keeping in mind that we measure you know thousands of metabolites in a single untargeted me method and so there you know the validation and and validity of some of that isn't is something that we should be discussing and Russ those are key key comments and you know translating information one I only make I only make the point that iron suppression is in the mass spectrometry paper in 1950 and the first significant electrc spray payer mechanistically from uh cabalian tang in 1994 also demonstrated differences in ionization efficiency as a function of structure that you can truly only resolve with a biochemical M mimic that is appropriately labeled and that's really the point or another way of saying it is good luck on the biology and the discovery because it's a hard yard it's hard to go from left hand side of that equation to the other side yeah well I I totally agree with Tim and that that that the discovery platform and the quantitative platform or the clinical testing of biomarkers are two separate uh workflows and and the discovery the things that we do discover uh typically are more greater differentials the the resolution of the discovery experiment is list limited so if we're looking for 5% differences is uh you know then that's almost an improp possibility because of the biological variance alone but once we do have a reasonable biomarker I I agree that it's critical that if we're going to do targeted clinical work on that that we need the internal standards to account for Recovery suppression and all of those in above but again I I concur that it's two separate workflows and and we work on both of those ends and that we try to do the discovery and then ultimately if there's a clear need for clinical High rigorous quantitation then we move to more targeted type of methods yes I uh really agree with that and uh in global profiling um uh which is uh predominantly the discovery part um uh for us um if we don't have quantitative response most likely we just will not see uh the change we we will miss a bu marker and uh um our goal is uh especially like with the standard mixture we use it only in method development phase and then as a system suit um uh so uh we just uh make sure that we um are covering in semi-quantitative fashion uh the passway or Target or group of metabolites of Target or uh just as many as we can and we have um um a digital tool that allows us to uh to do that and uh uh we are preparing a publication on um our approach um uh but um uh with quantitative essay which is a followup and this is a confirmation uh that you do have a true biomarker then uh uh there is no uh way around it we need uh an internal standard great to I would on this so we're we're drawing to a close to a close um and I think we've had some great discussion um I would on this slide I would uh draw everyone's attention and Christina can comment um I'm particularly interested in question two um in that we've talked a lot about targeted and I think there's General consensus in a targeted assay you want an internal standard for every metabolite that you're trying to measure if it's possible and although it sometimes isn't but untargeted is is kind of the the big open question here right um no one has a consistent way of of dealing with internal standards of on targeted experiments and how many is the right number how many is enough how many is too many do you uh just try to span your attention time range decently do you want uh do you try to make uh you know to do as good quantitation as you can out of the untargeted what's the right answer I'm I'm interested in in short term uh what's what's the answer to the number of internal standards the classes of internal standards for untargeted Charles can I if I can throw in my two cents here because we actually have spent a great deal of time on exactly this we use as complex a mixture as possible in our case using our very efficient gamma radiation so and in addition because we've got so many we end up doing a quantitation on the a to a musce algorithm that is the total area under the curve for the two samples and we then normalize the um C12 sample the Natural Abundance sample to the c-13 internal side the c-13 internal side is kept at a constant and so therefore we are always normalizing to a constant that normalization is actually applicable to every compound in the sample and so we're able to normalize those compounds that do not have an internal standard and I think that's the part that I was trying to get to for you because I think you can run an unbiased an Anis um in using a chem a sufficiently complex internal standard and actually assist and better the results on your um untargeted side thanks Chris any other comments here on this slide char Charles I just think there there's there's this philosophy of chromatographic separations vers versus an infusion or a flow injection experiment and whether a flow injection bolus can be corrected in a manner more more appropriate than a chromatographic separation one of the things that I've seen presented by Gary Van Burl in a very different context is infusing uh a constant flow of a combination of internal standards whilst doing something like a chromatographic separation so you have a constant infusion versus a chromatographic peak and unfortunately we don't have the tools to do normalization with a constant infusion as the denominator we do Peak over Peak not constant infusion so we still have a software gap on it at least creating some degree of hybridization of infusion normalization with a handful of internal standards versus chromatographic normalization where generally you just can't put enough of them in there if you want really great data it's an interesting approach um well we are reaching the end of our session here which is scheduled to end at 305 um so I am very sorry to cut discussion short um we had a lot of other great questions I think we had a great um set of panelists I think um to me um I we've highlighted uh that there is a diversity of opinions uh on this issue of internal standards um what I'll say is that um I hope to compile the notes from this session and distribute it out and um maybe maintain a dialogue um I and and what I would encourage all of you to do um if you had thoughts that didn't get to be shared is to engage with long-term working groups um that are that are interested in this um that could be mqu and and it could be um the NIH metabolomics Consortium through Tim orai or others um and I think a key point is that vendors are eager from my experience to hear um our our needs and our ideas and um they should be a partner in this process um and so um I although we didn't have enough time to get into to solve the issues of the field today um we should all be thinking about how we can help make these ideas make these uh make interlaboratory uh cooperation on these issues and vendor cooperation a reality um so um I um please let's stay engaged on this topic um and I look forward to continuing to uh to correspond with some of you in the future um uh so thank you very much for your session for participating in the session thank you Charles for organizing thank you Tim for your efforts and my fellow speakers Charles could you somehow capture the chat uh text because I know there's been a couple of references posted in there I've tried to copy it but I can't do it so I abely I after the chat I I believe I have it set to save but I'll make sure I do before the meeting ends um and just email it that'd be great so appreciate it take care all thank you very much it was great discussion yeah it was hopefully we can stay engaged thanks Charles and Tim is is the chat staying open for just a minute I'm going to try and grab that link that you're asking me for sure we'll leave the chat open for the next 10 minutes or so just give me a give me a second um I think Gary Van bur has presented thank you very much for I think I remember that as well it was the uh it's the work he was doing with the uh tissue micro deection and he was looking at propanal I think and then doing a constant infusion of propranol internal standard and they had to develop their own internal technology to actually do an integration with an infusion as well as a chromatographic overlay um we also work with Randy Julian on that we've never moved that one forward so whatever yeah there was another individual who did something with aceton nral proton bound dimer which actually reflected some of that work too and I'll have to look at that reference because there was some interesting work about using that dier as a as a measure of electric spray stability and normalization oh that would be Rick Rick king um yeah yeah that's that's and he actually patented it I'm trying to find yeah so we tried that as well um and we tried and you can get basically trying to use clusters to infer variations in ionization response it made no sense we spent about a year on it and I still don't understand it made no sense to me it's taking me a while to what was the session you came from anyway Tim hardest working maning Show Business You Are by the way uh oh not anymore um I came from a internal the sorry metabolic ident identification session that I was chairing all right I found a reference it was anal chemistry in two that long ago a decade ago wow give me a second let me just this is at least I think the first one I remember seeing this in I so I wish it was a nice way of doing copy paste this looks a mess I got it all right so I see FES on Chris isn't so I understand that you're doing derivatization of two separate specimens in a combination is that right or are they combined and I say I think Tim I know you've used the eroa workflow right yes I you recombine independent derivatization and recombination what is that you split the sample linted two and you use two separate derivatization strategies to generate the two different C12 C13 patterns you recombine them and assay them as a single speciment is that correct I don't know what I don't know the new one the old one was just a ionically labeled yeast that was grown um and isolated and used as a as a reconstitution standard that's one we' used I don't know about the new new one yeah oh sorry the workflow is anyway hi Russ hi hi Tim the the workflow is such that we have um you know it's it is a fully labeled yeast standard and we have two samples one is the 95% internal standard that is spiked into the um experimental samples and the other one is a 95 5% yeast extract mix one: one which is analyzed every 10 or so samples that way we could build a reference library and also use that you know we call that the longterm reference standard and we we've measured the stability over five years and it's perfectly stable but you know it tells you a lot about your platform stability of course you you know now now I understand yeah yeah now understand but it doesn't tell you about differential ionization efficiency of these unknown metabolites and I keep coming back to this the electric spray process is not a universal ionization system well well we use it to you know as Chris mentioned we we use it to normalize but we also use it um because it has 800 compounds or or more we use it to correct for um Iron suppression you mean those yeast materials are added into every patient specimen or every study sample or are they still just yes every they're added in well then again I reiterate those unless it is a mimic of the analy of choice it isn't going to be a the same why we know this from the service activity work from Chris en you get differential ionization efficiencies it's the cheeseburger guy blame the cheeseburger guy that's what I saying you mean if it's not the same metabol he's me the Matrix The Matrix changes in a clinical setting from someone who has a high fat diet versus someone who doesn't and that's that alters dramatically that's the cheese well and then and then kidney disease I mean we have to come in with a central premise that the person is not normal and in fact I've only ever seen one normal human he was in California somewhere I think he was a hippie he was very very happy so what's normal right I mean we have this incredible tool and I I don't begrudge you the challenge of trying to measure so many things with confidence I think all of these tools add value to the question of confidence yeah no I mean we we've had some great uh you know we we've done it with um gee lots of different matrices and we haven't seen any issues um we're we're going to you know we're working on a uh round robin to look at um you know cross laes inter laboratory you know we we've done it with um everything from Cannabis you know to blood to urine and we know we just don't see these major see you know this Matrix effect that's not possible unless you're using gcei with TMS derivatization that is not possible well maybe we can you know show you some data and take it offline but um you know of Chris has got some great data um it's the Achilles heel of the electric spray process well happy to you know as I say I we just don't see the Matrix effect um but you know I I'd like to I'd like to you know continue that discussion Tim Char thanks for the light call up I appreciate the um the the request and uh are you going to share the slides to the people who signed in I um I'm going to just uh ping all the presenters one more time to make sure that's all right but my plan is to share the uh drive or well we'll find out what they have planned as far as Mana as far as slide distribution but I don't see why not to make the slides available to the whole uh Mana Consortium really um through the Mana website so that would be my mine are cleared so you can share them thank you guys I really appreciate perfect well thank you so much your slides were were great and and I think we did have a good discussion I think I I you know I learned that we're all in as as somewhat predicted we're all in a little bit different places as far as uh you know what we think the greatest you know needs are and and how we do develop our protocols and it really you know if if nothing else it confirms that you know to to develop I mean you know a i it isn't possible to create a totally one-sized fits-all solution to internal standards or standards or or um you know references but uh you know to the extent that we can uh work together on this uh um you know we have a long way to go both on the adoption of best practices right I think that's one thing that that you may be a little bit easier but then as far as really standardizing procedures and uh you know metabolomics data that that comes out of it so that an analytical lab um you know has a chance of getting um the same you know you know quantitative results as would come out of a clinical lab um I I think we have we have a lot of work to do ahead of us um and and I think it's you know it's it's informative and and kind of fun to see that through these types of discussions yes indeed nice job gentlemen and nice job all the speakers thanks again Tim give me more than a seven days heads up next time yes I will and I apologize I was I was late in getting speakers out and and uh and and you you a um probably one of the very latest that I contacted so I apologize for that but good support about it nevertheless of course thanks guys and thank all right I'm gonna end the meeting for all um have a good afternoon enjoy the rest of the conference
