everyone you'll hear me already okay um I'm uh uh I'm a first year PhD student in dcmb uh in Dr Joshua Welch's lab today's topic is a multi-oh maker single cell velocity models interactions and improves the self-read prediction this is the official application title slightly different than the one I posted before but uh means the same thing um today I will go through the multival paper uh recently published the uh I will go through the background message results and then the discussion before time allows I will show a short multivariable tutorial um single cell technology has gone through Rapid development in the past few years nowadays in a single match people can sequence tens of thousand cells at the same time um so one of the popular platform is attacks genomics like shown on the lab um the sequences uh each single cell with the Articles and uh got a re expression or accounting accessibility accounts um as a result but it's so many cells that people are naturally interested in how um the cells develop into each other for example if one sequence the current issue they want to know if the ones they label the radio clear is a developing into what other cell types for example the hydro size or the neurons similarly for the brain cell for the blood cells they want to see if the hspc cells are developing into other stem cells or the red blood cells foreign it is that when the platformer does the sequencing the cells are destroyed that means we count the track a global sales over time to see how they develop into other cell types for example in the figure show above well the the cell tool and the cell one that I have for um colors are the ones that we only we only see but in reality we can't see the past or the future of those cells and then we can't retail uh what they are true assessors and The Descendants look like to solve this problem there are many computational approaches that uses this snapshots uh single time points between infer the gene expression changes along the development process this is what we call the trajectory ingredients algorithms they will use the cellular similarity based on the pairwise cellular expression distance and the map to a common Super Time access to define the developmental relationship among these cells um money myself are developed including several popular ones such as the model called Valencia and the slingshot molecule for example is the very first one that uh develops the track reverence algorithm it uses a minimum expanding tree for example like shown in the figure but at the usual for the traditional trajectory information algorithm is that they can't predict the directions or risks of several transitions because uh the distance among cells is bi-directional and there is no um earlier or later definition that means if we give it a root cell we can find the latest cells but uh without a rule cell definition the lineages can go Eatery the recent developed iron velocity actually addresses this limitations by using mathematical modeling of the splicing Dynamics before going into the detail of RNA velocity background um let me recap that a simple biological definition splicing so during the post entrepreneurial process not only the five prime or care but under the three prime or poly examination or I did one important step is that the insurance over the preameric are stressed out and the resulting mature sliced MRA for user as a protein habits this is the splicing this is the Amara splicing and the definition of velocity here is that the um the distance ecosystem speed times the time x equals VT as we learned from a physics classes earlier in a more formal definition uh in calculation we can also say DX over DT equals B and similarly in the definition of RA velocity we say that the change of primary equation because the primary velocity multiplied by the time uh because we have two modalities this time we have both the unsplized velocity and Supply stability you an X uh the definition of iron velocity is given by the first publication about the rmlc by lament in 2018 it is defined as the first derivative of both slides the MRA eyes there are several parameters that kind of affect the the final MRE abundance uh all these are based on the biological process for example for example the transparent read Alpha this tells the um how fast the free Armory the transplant is produced and then a slice I read beta tells how fast the ice spliced RNA is changed into splice array and then finally the degradation read comma it tells how fast the slides are level drops that the whole process is to summarized in the figure on the lens we see that when the transcript is about zero like shown on the right the as well as the counter goes up as expected then going through the splicing the slides the pump also goes up in this simplified model the transparated has only two values one is the positive value for the induction State this is the induction State means that the junction is actively hiding and then when transparent stops terminates the trajectory that becomes a zero let's look at the actual Authority differential equations used in the iron velocity method the velocity is we people said yes or DT election before the finalized velocity EO over DT it is the shortcut with the minus a slice and read multiplied by the current unspliced account and the folder supplies the velocity it is defined as the splicing Bridge multiplied by the current I suppose count minus the degradation rate times the the current rise account this two formulas uh essentially summarizes the whole splicing process if we solve the all these Solutions um and about the unsplashed count against the slice count we get a fixed poultry like shown on the right it has a classic uh overall thing um above for the horizontal above the diagonal line is the reduction state we are attraction is actively happening and below the dotted line is the regression state where uh function as a terminated so basic principle is a trigonal Dynamics can be imported by RN slicing Analytics election on the on the diagram to the right the previously that the rule cells and the directions are well defined this time I like in the traditional respectful Universe devices thank you there are actually two types of iron velocity models one is the term the steady state model um this is a first as followed by the uh by the first author of our royalty by metal uh later on let's improve the into a dynamic model called the IC value by Walker Morgan uh because uh multivarello essentially depends on the dynamical model uh like just like guys I will omit the steady state Model A simpler one and explain this one in more detail uh in this dynamical model the analytical solutions could only use are obtained solving the tool all these We Got U equals something and then is equal to something depending on some initial values here the uh because those are the audio differential equations they now depend on T this is what we call a latent time it says the standard terminal for pseudo pack but uh use the frequency in the dynamical model uh the difference compared to the previous statistic model is that all the cells this time are used for to optimize the read parameters that I shown earlier compared to the steady state model we are only at the top and the lower quantiles cells are used you see that you may see that we are not using a t here in the analytical Solutions we use scroll because there are either two states one induction and one person and these two states have different initial values so that we use for to develop the 8x3 uh that should recently there are even more advanced the Single Cell measurements how the Single Cell multi-ohmic measurements this uh technology can modify the protein accessibility and energy expression from the same side of cells not only the this time not only areas the same ways this allows us to see the relationship between the current Gene and the gene expression with this new technology we seek to answer several questions that are previously unsolvable for example how to IP genome and electron change so that the cells are into each other and witch modality changes first if there is a timeline between changes how long are they the one to post 100 years ago up or down to take advantage of this new multi-oh omega technology we developed multi-value as an extension to the classic RM velocity model um data models that grow many Dynamics as a Upstream process to the splicing Dynamics used in our LLC here you see that on the left we added the two equations one for Chrome Gene opening and the one for Contin closing is the two equations equations affect the downstream or processes such as Junction slicing and attack relation along the way I said I'll look closely like I added a new equation this time a DC over 80 is defined as a the KC KC is a cronking state indicator it is the one for completing opening State and zero for home team closing state RFC is the currently opening or closing rate and then see here is the Chrome team accessibility as measured in the axe account it's a unclear uh just look at the equation but what it looks like in in plot is that it essentially goes to 1 or 0 is financially depending on the current state like shown on the right um we propose that this formula both with a biological reasoning as well as a empirical um empirical definition uh if we thought that the they can if we applaud that the company accessibility along the date and time referred by only our velocity we see that uh the company acidity goes up on the bound um you know similar pattern as exponential functions like shown on the bottom because there are six example genes that we're probably the biological reasoning for why we choose the exponential functions that during the initial impulse or for concrete opening or closing signals the changes is very quick but eventually when um it becomes nearly open fully open or fully closing due to the physical size of nucleosomes um the rate of changes will slow down foreign relationship they are not necessarily always coupled meaning that one one whether he goes up the other doesn't necessarily follows closely we think there are two possible models two possible orders propose we'll start with the only priming base this is so when the concrete starts to open but the ra stays at zero uh which is the reason that is I like people are already to be produced on a Locus that is closed so company has to open first then post model will go into the couple the induction base where we are both the grounding and the re levels go up now the difference is when uh either or Marathi uh sold some or jobs uh for model one the Chrome thing closing we see is the transmission regression state and the the order is reversed for model 2. and finally um both the model will reach a stability reprized phase where both this is a this model is a this modeling is uh used for each team but each team will have their own models in reality some of the steps some of the faces may not be observed we give for two definitions versus the priming this is when the Chrome team opens before the translation initiates there is a timeline between uh between when the chocolate starts under the Chrome beam topics the copying is defined in the info there is a time like between the content closing and the judgmental repression um like a song on the left uh the top one is showing the priming uh priming phase where the counting already goes up but the US last count stays at zero and therefore the department at the bottom uh the company start to drop first and then I slice the final photos this is uh actually only for model one the four model two the order will be reversed on the right I'm showing the classical face portrait for iron velocity U versus Ice and the diagonal line is the steady state where this is used in the steady speed model I will not explain that um when adding in the Chrome team we essentially expand the process into four states the requirement that coupled on the coupling and a couple of states um this is a also only for model one for model two the decoupling uh the company order will be reversed for crunching under the ra um so on the right I'm this time I'm showing the Chrome team versus Ice slice that at the University size uh it's a more difficult to see it in 2D actually because this time of the actual data is as ready uh is a protein isolated and spliced and the simulation result for model 1 and model 2 genes look like the figures here the difference here is is a mainly that the Chrome team closes the state and the transcriptional termination state powder is reversed for the left completing process works but on the right the transitional terminal is first the question terminators the goal here is a like other optimization algorithms so we want to fit a best trajectory to the observations under solve for the primary parameters but assume that the other observations are IID and the residuals are normally distributed along the true Obe solution coordinates that means that it forms a true variant gaussian along the along the proposal of these solution here the OB prediction is the five and then the distribution is given by material negotiating uh now to minimize the to maximize the negative for local electrical we would maximize maximize the MSE um if we just look at the term at the end here I am borrowing the figure from Icy value this is the example RNA velocity only but it is it tells a cool story about how the curve is fitted essentially it's similar to a linear regression but there is a fitting two ode solutions to the observable data all these models are for for each team uh the actual fitting the process is that we know uses a list of uniformly spaced time points to represent the actual time uh the only solution as I said before not only depends on the read parameters but also depends on the time um we not only don't know the audio solution but also we don't know the timeline either so there's two this two uh values need to be before the stack by step so understanding we choose uh yeah I'm also expectation maximization algorithm to either to be optimized the unit vectors and the time assignments foreign to each observation based on the current best OD parameters and in the optimizations in the maximization step the Audi parameters are again optimized based on the given time assignments to each cell in reality most times we also observe partial trajectory for each gene rather than a complete that the compose all for both the induction State and the religious state uh some options only has an infection state for example multiple uses certain algorithms to predetermine the pattern let's speed up the population there are two important Downstream analysis both are based on the dynamical model developed by ISO value the first one is the velocity stream plot this is visualized we already visualized on the umap embeddings of the RNA Matrix this summarizes the sale of transitions based on the splice velocity and the expression of all genes and it scales the particularly the lineages among cells the cell transition Matrix here is based on cosine stability the intuition for this one is that when two cells are expected to be to be our ancestors and descendants the slice the velocity will agree with the difference between they are a spiced accounts that means that uh that direction under the supply is the difference will match another important analysis is a global lead in time when we fit each gene separately we get um a time for each cell for each gene but that in the end we want to see a global trend of all the genes so that we can tell the differentiation relationship among those cells across all the genes I will show the actual examples right now the First Data Center we tested is from the 10x genomics ENT models the green data set is a public data set on their website um this is uh based on the cell render Arc one published in two years before um you see that incorporating the Chrome Gene accessibility and the genius version improves the accuracy of velocity here this here are the cell type are labeled on the umap coordinates under the expected Direction goes from the radio clear into the iso site direction as well as the neuronal direction um the later time or if we look at the deleted time for example the darkest point is where we predict the rule cell to be and as a time or As Time increases the cell type becomes more mature but if we look at only the variable of the result from IC battle we see that there are backflows in the upper layer um and uh there's a unexpected uh inward flow uh in epidemic cells right but they in contrast the body value prefix the velocity streams are very accurately and the agrees with the biological expectations um the in this site I show a utility for benefit of including containing accessibility if we plot the two micro genes both some of the cell types um C1 are you Army size and you see that in the face portrait of for U and S other than the uh other than the cell type but they are a marker take a demand the other cell types all cut into context later and we can't see the details inside those cell types but if we expand it into the chromium Direction when we say that uh all the cell types are now well separated if we model the company flexibility along with both the ra Expressions then we can better resolve or the type of relationship of those cells um this one is also benefited or for including Chrome team in a previous uh review paper for R velocity it's showing that if we slowly increase the transfer rate uh the fitted trajectory for induction phase will become more strict uh becomes more linear for this example Gene CDH is certain in the model Square data set we observe a similar pattern for ice value are only are the only result has a very large curvature that is not fitting the data well but if we include the query as well the model without the trajectory is defeating the cells very well impose the re face poultry as well as the cool beam versus Ice slice of this portion in the country versus iOS before we see that the company increases that means that the traffic rate this time all is uh jointly defined that jointly modeled as the transferability to multiply by the current Computing accessibility are perhaps the C really increase the size the proposed model foreign we also see clear examples of model 1 and model 2 genes um I said tb2 is a model 1G the quality the barrel indicates that we are the Computing closes this time of in this Gene the prompting courses before the transmitter retention happens this is which is divided by language that is for model 2. sorry uh the color here is the code being accessibility we can see that the protein closing date the prediction is very accurate it is the test inside the highest contains of the region and also true former Greer through the grouping closing point is a equity model that within the highest on the society region um but at this time I'll like in model one the grounding the accessibility jobs after the translation new version happens which is also which is uh denoted by the cross and the plotting the colors with the cell types we see the baseball fields of these two of these two genes so accurate the feeding result some other analysis for this data set we see that the model 2 genes achieved the highest splice expression earlier in a later time the model 2 genes the model 1 genes the fold the figures on the right I'm showing the maximum more splice the expression along the little time along the little time of access across the cell types you see that there are a lot more genes uh in model 2 that I have earlier splice the expression we can also summarize the type of genes into a pressure there are four types of genes possible for the partial protocol trajectory so we we can have all the actual images and regression regions um other for the company that directly we have a two different decoupling patterns so that there are more than one and multiple two genes we see that the model one is usually the most common um this time on model 2G is the second most popular and followed by interaction in the recursion um this is a this figures here show utility for a result of 40 in pythons on the topper first let me display the colors so the red one is the prime the case the Orange is coupled down and followed by the couple of the green phase and the blue one is covered out for each region um any of the four states kind but they are they have to be ordered and on the bottom I'm showing the state assignment for three genes robot 2 on the first row we are two on second row and going to be on the third row vulnerable tool this Gene is model one gene um as I said before for model 1G protein causes before transmission terminates this is a show on the view map of the API versions you see that uh when pumping level drops the eyes like the Expressions feel is still going on that means that there's a departing region um and I'm enabling as a circle um the multival model predicts the right region to be the developing region and it agrees away so we would expect on the right I'm posting the dynamic quality for each gene this means that so this is the prime assignment of each cell or inside each gene and the y-axis is the the three modality variables homogeneous we see that when uh the quoting start to draw in the green phase the ice slice and the slice the state is either right required level uh you may wonder why the ice price are not increasing um just because the toxic is actually a Upstream process of the icewise it can already determine people the major in fact is uh um is the equality or decreasing for the re uh we put the ra across so we are two this is a model progen um increases uh even after the children has installed um like shown on the sir the umap the region here labeled as green is the department predicted by the model uh and the agrees with uh what do we would expect similarly we can tell from the dynamic approach the Korea tool it actually account still increases when the ice plus the jobs in the green phase green 2B is a either one it is a induction origin normally has the induction base repose decreases uh it has a clear priming base in this uh circular region labeled as a red red is the predicting the prime the base the square tool a toxic level increases and the slides the power of State at 0. it is the data set that we observe a clear casket of for State transitions of four states along the neuronal Clusters if we summarize the summaries of the genes that they under the cell States in those genes we can also plot the predicted State intervals for each gene this is summarize the in the figure on the left uh the prime the interval comes around interval deposit interval and a couple of if people will follow each gene which we observe that it is usually shorter uh for the Department intervals I mean Diablo is a now here is a divided as both the requirement that we coupled intervals those are unmatched intervals but for the coupled intervals those are longer on a couple of this is uh effective because in general we still expect that the Chrome Gene accessibility and the gene expression to be highly correlated um in this model we actually models the Chrome diary complete closing read and opening rate as a two separate green parameters uh but we observe that the ratio of the closing rate under the open rate is a very close one in the end that means that we can essentially model them as a similar read the second data set we tested is the shares signal multi hair follicle here set um again the multivalo of a producer accurate lineages all this data set the pack one and pack two cells are divisioning into RX and the hair shaft generated by the line um also the little time agrees with the model velocity stream predictions and this is that the terminal stays the terminal cell has a high score later type prediction it is very messy I say value our only prediction uh we see that this uh is an iron velocity result actually agrees very well with a suitable timer based tracker inverse devices so the black Air result um show on the right uh this is taken from the CRC the paper for this data set that we see a lot more induction only genes and the fewer model 2 genes um we observe a one very clear cognitive priming um Gene in this data set is the wnd history uh this Gene if we look at the you might perform the stream but that is for the attack sync the star the level goes up very early on uh in the lineage level uh and then the I slice the MS slice I splice the unexplan half the balls later on we use the another algorithm called the dynamical time warping that make time working to copy the timeline between the three modalities this algorithm more non-linearly Works A Tool Time series to maximize their similarity essentially that tries to match full-time series uh by expanding some of the time point and shrinking the other five points yeah and then if we look at the figure on the right I use the 20 discrete beams for the time assignment as input through the to the ddw algorithm obviously that uh at the dotted lines align the predicted the match then time points all the two varieties and there's a time like between the time points with the transmission on the weekend computer this we can easily populate this and I'm like from this algorithm um for the for the first figure on the right it is the chromatin under the slice these expressions um we see that there's a very large lag between the two curves the second the figure shows that as less than the splice account here there's a smaller decoding region between the two girls um if you thought that the delta T between between the two minorities well is that the C and Islip is always above the UI is like that means that the chromium is live is always larger than the ice flat select again on the bottom I'm showing the dynamic plot for the stream modalities uh see you and I spotted against the time assignment for this Gene they observe a clear title for priming along along the way see we look at C and U or U analysis the third data set that we tested is the Tomato poetic stem and projected cells is SPC this is the blood cell again using the complete information we observe a more accurate creating without uh here the cell types are labeled under all the cell types are here are actually projector cells of some kind of of some hand um none of them are currently terminally stable cell types the whole current velocity analysis so we don't expect with only in fact that the terminal analysis terminal cell has to have a good analysis result because they are not differentially anything anymore um here under like the the predicted Direction goes from HIC into all other cell types uh some major cell types are TMP granular site Microsoft side under play date for icml or resulted um sweep of the Supreme Court is a various Branch it doesn't start from the HSC and doesn't end either the terminal cell types it is it is data set uh again we observe a very similar Gene type of distributions um like the The Offspring and again the speech time switch time meter for the false dates um agreed with the atmosphere as well with the couple intervals the longer than the department ones foreign for cell cycle in terms of for the material analysis uh here I'm showing the three cell cycle genes both three and then it is on the new map subtiting for only those abilities well with the ddps I resorted either credit uh we see that uh the apexito seems to always go up up to the end but the sliced account only expressed the in intermediate cell types this is a model tool pattern um in this as I said we saw fiber very clear of climbing by making use towards each of the criminal cell types on the left I'm plotting the dynamic for the street varieties for the five genes just selected before we say that there are certain regions that the Chrome beam has already increased but the ice supplies the state at 0. besides the absolute expressions for the Apex and Ice blind splice we can also plot the velocity inside because this is a actually a mathematical modeling it has the values of DC or dtp is already key for example um it will look at the velocity result we see the besides the terminal cell types back back to the end the earlier stem cell populations have increasing all right that means the these cells have for the potential to differentiated into other cells but when you can reaches that the communal cell type is the velocity drops rapidly and it's not differentiating anymore on the must be on the right I'm showing the classic face portrait for the fact of the Philippines this uh since the only handful of election only actually um the last data set that we tested is that the Fatal human brain data set just like the most players that we see a very good prediction in the um the root cell is going to be a second population next to radiograph cells and like and then it goes into the actual side direction to the opcs and the tools and neuronal images up to the upper layer under the deeper layer um at any time more prediction who is well with the wealthy stream clock where the segment competition is the earliest High Point icml again there are some more backflows along the indices that we're going on just like the most spring again we see submachines belonging to the model 1 and the model 2 item coming the highest the Chrome DNA facility precedes a the highest price like this question and then adding for the Mac 2C is a model 2G where the company possibility follows the highest price the extraction and then simulative the cell type of distribution of this project for this data set that we did a more extensive analysis using the date and time before the uh Airport from a multivitle if they assume that at the later time is actually time we can use data to find the timeline between the RNA expression or for a transfer factor and is Downstream of find inside the accessibility is we would expect that the expression the expression of uh chocolate Factor would force the increase then the um accessibility of is the downstream batting side the increases and this is a um performed in the 14th solution are shown here um all those are classic uh neuronal TX um here the magenta is the genius version and the yellow ones are the Upstream binding cycle Alexander you see that the accessibility always is always later than the maximum gene expression and we can also come up with the using the view map for expressions the highest kings version up here is a very early is already quite late uh that is another analysis is uh to see for the single nucleotide polymorphism snips and that they are Associated genes uh here I'm showing the maximum of the exactly and then the maximum gene expression of course Gene on the new map so um the accesses is the maximum stable accessibility and the y-axis is the primal or for the maximum ra expression minus the maximum state for example t that means if the value is positive um already is expressed later than the than the accessible sleep um and if it's a close to zero then they match very well we only observed three islands of the 757 Snips we found associated with the highly variable genes did this data set that makes sense because usually um fall asleep to affect the gene uh later on it tended to be accessible before the gym is priced or at least it is closely coupled to the gene expression um for the three islands I completed the some of the example new maps on the right foreign that's the end of result uh some discussions you see that the module can accurately recover sound images and only by the lines of code I mean decoupling intervals of the Chrome deeper accessibility and the clean version um we assume that there are two types of Gene version models model 1 model 2G and we found the two examples of both models in the website there are still some limitations um in the multivateral algorithm because it's very similar to ISO value um interesting here is created a security but uh we really want to see um a global Trend that matches all the genes at the same time rather rather than treating each one separately and uh later on later on aggregated but because there can be a main consistency reading individual community um there are there are more completely scenarios possible than the tool proposed the models for example audible reduction repression Cycles in the clothing or the ra also it cannot handle multiple religious Dynamics such as genes-based multiple reduction introductories in different cell types how this work will be pretty expanded by members of our lab agent so stay tuned for the final result uh I want to thank my mentor Dr Welch and uh Maria Brown more Dr Cassie Collins lab for generating the HSBC data set I looked at the menu forces please check out the oral and the paper is recently published in natural technology and really if you are interested in the city uh plus only five minutes left I will just like explain the input data and then you can check out the dyno for step by step usage tutorial uh the major requirements are the multiple of the parents result is include that the future linkage that it means the accounting Peaks to genes because it is Data Center we are using a gene Centric approach all the Peaks need to be aggregated to which Gene works and this is a power is about that and then the similar to all other attacks result we have for the particle that features under Matrix for rec and the 8X versions uh we had like Peak annotations um full uh for ironing velocity at least for now uh it requires a pre-processing set that uh Smooths the Expressions among neighbors this is to solve for the job of issue and it makes the gene Expressions uh smoother are among the neighbors so that uh the factory can be fitted well um in this approach for re we use the similar similar approach as ice battle that finds a kn ee Matrix using only re but therefore a toxic wingstack that uses the surround within the nearest neighbor ocean this uh considers not only the ra but also the Apex and then um the vinyl sample is used through what does that do with the message as well it is a shortly used to quantify the high slide that and the slides the account finally I want to Mommy I want to see the r velocity is that it is a really nice that extends the single monarchy um by treating the Einstein as by as the data set separately um and then you can use that with the PIP or contact any for the using python as a multiplier thank you very much for listening and uh I'm happy to take any questions we are about out of time um if you're online you have a question you can put it in some slack chat or SnapChat uh Zoom chat if you're in the room and you've got a quick question we can go and ask or we try to get safety minutes yet so maybe I miss this are you filtering genes that you're looking at their Associated eggs for this yes yeah so uh for re uh expression analysis there is a filtering standard called the highly variable Gene selection um which also said only the ones that is a top variable and for attack CPA is similar or yeah just a few connections from your some of your messages is of agricultures from SD are the laws so have you run some like uh more uh to see how they are relationships are um this is the first session and the second one is uh this is something very fine word so have you I'll consider maybe that you maybe change the future with people who you integrate the special information to this the first one uh so we haven't developed any uh specific quantitative or comparison for the wealthy stream differences because uh currently the result are quite uh article we can look at the cell types and tell you for the transitions that make sense or not um but for leader analysis both a more complicated models later on we will develop a bicycle product and for the spatial analysis that's a very good question that's what we are or thinking about and we'll work on that soon thank you very much the earning in philosophy is just to remarkable idea and it's incredible that it works so well and your addition to it to incorporate the comment and it seems like a sort of a natural uh increase in reality and realism for it but I guess I'm um sort of a two-part question one is as you increase the model complexity especially with like Udi modeling they become um stiff and difficult to identify so I'm curious if you could comment on sort of the Practical challenges of hitting sort of more flexible models these types of data and I guess sort of the second part is is I can sort of dream up additional complex complexities that you're not handling and I'm curious how sort of where do you draw the line and how do you test if you're overfitting the data and like I I you know what are sort of your general ideas about you know how do you sort of detect if you've sort of gone too far and you're sort of fitting the noise it won't generalize better yeah uh thank you for the question so um for this uh method is already much more complicated than the original R velocity uh single large marginal one was with six characters and this one I explained to 10 or 12 right ways that uh with a different state uh switching time as well as the content with privateers and the free time is a lot longer as well but because we propose a simple exponential function that they need to do well with the previous RNC our velocity models the results are just as stable as a serial optimization result uh but if we I guess you're right that if we want to extend the two even more complicated models it carries out in um non um stable parameter result um that will be very difficult to feed um and then for the second question um I guess uh there are a more complicated uh parameters of all the biological process such as the master chemical equations that are depends on tensile for tensile parameters I don't think that it would well well in terms of what a single cell analysis um at least not with a simple optimization algorithm from Senpai using deep learning they solve for such problems I know we are our lab is also you might stick into it that doesn't address overfitting okay so how do you know that you aren't overheating them that's a cool question um this uh uh for now is not the issue yet uh for the ode I'm predicting is a protein and if the refractors are optimized then there's not yet a power cleaning issue here the full I guess for more complicated models there maybe our future need tools so you you haven't there's no way to check or you haven't traveled overfitting at all we haven't checked the this Matrix yet yeah I'll bring that discuss later so exactly the hour so I think we might need to wrap up so thank you but
