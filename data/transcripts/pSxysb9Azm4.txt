hmmm we can go ahead and get started welcome to tools and technology seminar series for any of you who have not been to this seminar before or have not been a very long time as I know a few of you have this is basic as a venue to discuss new tools technologies and or methodologies that are newly developed currently in development or just of use to researchers this is the last seminar for this semester next weeks has been cancelled so we will break for the summer and then start up again the fall I am looking for presenters so if anyone's interested you know just let me know otherwise I'm gonna have to track you down and twist your arms to talk so anyway if I was interested I do please let me know so today I'm pleased to present our speaker yeah Lee who is the chemistry librarian and she's going to talk to us about Popkin Thank You Marcy hello everyone I guess for the rest of time I'll have to see it because I need to do some online demo so if you and sometimes I may tie my head around so if you don't hear me well anymore just let me know okay well good knowing everyone and I'm very happy to be here to talk to you about pop camp so I was here three years ago maybe yeah I was talking more about more generally about small molecules resources and this time I'm gonna focus more on a pop-can side of the story and I'm just gonna overview a pop cam a little bit and then I'll move into a little live demo and some highlights about the source and then I'll talk a little bit about programmatic programmatic retrieval I'm not expert expert wit but I'll just mention a few possibilities that you could go explore yourself and yeah and before we get into the discussion I just want to here a little bit from you I have the assumption that this community are mainly working on biomolecules like gene and proteins so I'm wondering how you guys are are working with small molecules and why you are interested in them and how what you would like to receive them or how you would like to retrieve them so that's its most useful for your project anyone would like to share a little bit just briefly okay so yeah I should have cam discussed drug banking information now yeah great great yeah thank you anywhere else no one worked on small molecules we just need one more no big molecules on the okay maybe today when you see what's possible on this risk platform you would think more about what you can do with small molecules I guess the key if you only remember one thing from this talk today I hope you can remember how connected the pubchem data is which is a particular stress of this database so yeah so pop cam is we still kind of calling it a database however it's it's more of an archive or data repository actually an end a little bit depository at this moment now it's it takes data from all counselors so now I have the next slides to show you what kind of sources there can be before they only accept the data reported data depositing from those specific 4-h founded by oh I see projects but now they are opening the imposter up to anyone like if you have a set of about a see data and you would like to share a share it with the world you can use that you can do use pubchem to do that and you know people are interested and we can have a little more detail to talk about how do you deposit data in pubchem later but but in general the source of the data from pubchem came from a lot of places so that also creates the challenge there are probably two files of the chat and swallowed how much you you do you want to trust and how how would you select the piece that you truly need and the second part is how you can use those information can vary because it came from different sources so the copyright status of all those materials are different most of them came from some public funded project or government agency so those are okay but they do have data from commercial resources so that I'm gonna well if I go to the data sources and just do want to mention that it's beyond beyond the database data archive and the data repository it also provides a lot of tools that to allow you to analyze visualize the data all the platforms so if you are working with small molecules just feel free to explore those tools and now let's talk a little bit more about the data sources pop can have so so far they now have over 400 about like 440 data sources now they are in these categories the first one is of course the US government agencies H NIST FDA and so on yeah and they also incorporated boring and international organizations data because those are also openly available on internet and I wasn't specific about this well yes they also imported data from chemical vendors which can be a good thing and but sometimes it's also making it a little harder to differentiate the more objective and valid information from those vendors information that may not necessarily be very objective so but the good science pubchem always provides the propanol always provide the source and also how the source has has prepared the data so yeah it is just by paying a little more attention you won't know if you can trust them the fourth category is journal publishers I as far as I know the collaboration between them and a journal publishers are very limited for now because they are trying to get they are trying to mining the journal article data out of journals sometimes publishers have concerns about it but more people are getting more open to it and they the pubchem team is trying to get in touch with more teams like that too but the literature information from inside pubchem are still mostly came from PubMed indexing so yeah and the this category is academic institutions and that belongs to the the the part I was talking about that about the initially it's cut it comes from those bio as a project specifically founded by lh2 just to the bio essays but later on the those Institute that part becomes a broader sense like people can deposit any types of small molecule related data into it not only by OSA but even if you're not doing Bauer I say you can still deposits the physical properties spectra we hype self data that you created about a specific compound or substance into the pubchem repository so yeah the last category is under chemistry and biology databases that means overall open wounds on the web for example like chemspider or well I'm trying to think of others that's not a government agency once an even Wikipedia sometimes they pull data coming from a weak video too so yeah justjust trying to show that how broad their source can come from and I'm not gonna go there right now but if you're if you click on this link it you're gonna open a page like this and it lists out all specific sources including the chemical vendors that provided the information shoo - the pubchem database and the it's updated in real time so you can see the change of the amount and ways that they are providing sources an article also updates the LAT interface a little bit more so that you can browse a little more and search a little more for the source side of the story so yeah yeah so I noticed you had nature publishers reposted for academic journals the ones you would think of obviously would be ACS and RC are there any collaborations with pubchem there or are they still holding out for their own yeah so far I haven't heard that's a big they are getting in touch with ACS an RC about mining their journals yet I guess the the mining Journal part is really not their priority they kind of mostly relying on PubMed for the indexing part which is not sufficient for small molecules but but they they try - still not now they still try to focus on their own reorganization of the data and also the the just connecting to other small molecule databases instead of doing too much journal yeah but I know that the team is in is very active in the Cameo informatics community so who knows if sometimes maybe they find a good way to talk to each other and you session Ric they are much more open about data mining and text mining than the ACS journals so Chemical Abstracts service is a parallel organization as ACS publications they both belong to the American Chemical Society but they found the function separately so they are independent and yeah I didn't mentioned that much I last time where I was here I was talking about sign finder and every axis as databases for small molecule gene well the fundamental difference between those databases and hub cam is that those database is mainly working on literature mainly works on research articles and sometimes conference proceedings and so but Popkin is really more of archival in the report data repository so yeah because the source of the data is so complicated so PopCap has to do a lot of work try to really organize those data into a way that that's easier for for human and federal machine to consume so what they did was they created three essential database one c1 is substance another is battle si and the the bottom one is called compound and the beginners of parquet beginning users of ham often get confused with what's compound and what substance I guess what you need to remember is the comp company is the one more refined it's accurate instead of data but substance is what people deposit is a row apart like what whatever coming from the source or coming from the depositors of the data or scientists like you so but once they get to the substance information and the bioassay data from the the contributors they would try to link those substance and the bioassay and then try to standardize both and feed them into the compound database so essentially when you when you and me try to access path camp with better to start with the pubchem compound part that will make our life a lot easier I'll show you exactly how that can help a little later just one word before we move into the itself it's that standardization process is very complicated so we know that it's challenging to from machine to recognize the the chemical structures in the PDFs that's an image recognition issue however even if the databases are already have the molecular structure drawing inside there it's still very difficult to kind of indexing them in a way that that is consistent across all the sources because when people draw that draw the molecule structures the some tiny difference some tiny decision making could cause the machine not understanding the structure at all so they have done a lot of work trying to sort of those issues and try to essentially have machine to to be able to get those those substances pt+ will be posited by people index with index 2 is the appropriate compound record yeah and by the way I haven't mentioned that the pubchem team is actually very small as far as I know it's probably less than 20 people in a team and so they have to do a lot of work in order to get the machine to work for them and if you look at the number of records in the database it's quite amazing and it's been grossing this been growing quite exponentially especially for the substance part for the compound part it's a little more smoother and on the pubchem hope and at home page you can always check the real-time statistics of how many compounds and how many types of biases and different things there is I have no idea I think it's probably when their policy changes for how people would deposit the data I well I'm not gonna claim anything I don't know yeah oh by the way if you guys if any of you have recently participated any pubchem webinar there probably won't be too many new things for you today but just so you know that NCBI now do host webinars for Popkin information so if you would like you can go to those webinar and asks ask their staff member directory is they would be able to answer this kind of question yeah ok yeah now let's probably go into the database a little bit to see oh how it works so I'm gonna start with this home page and this home page many of you probably have seen it but beyond the simple search box interface they now have a beta version of a new search interface if it can open ok good now if I go to any of this five ways and I can go to for example compound and I was able to L be able to search keywords structure Monica formula for compounds and and just browsing by tabs and in fact I just want to point out the keyword search here is not truly a keyword search it only searches chemical names and they're synonyms so it's not like a PubMed search you are searching the whole whole records for four keywords this is only the names so I'm just gonna do a well by the way it does allow you to draw structures and here you can enter the machine-readable identifiers of compounds that you also can draw sub structure by I think to do search first I think if some plugging problem because if I there should be a structure search window open well I click on the sub structure tab yeah so this is why it's no beta I guess they are still trying to troubleshoot different things but it does have the possibility to search ways you drawing the structure okay now I'm just gonna search you very simple Monica Monica caffeine and you see a long list of compounds come up and it will also includes mixtures as you see and similar to any other NCBI databases you can use this kind of bracket at the end - typing specifications you if you do out at you so if I search if I want a search exact match of caffeine I I would just type in complete see no names and then oh oh no s-sorry hmm I first attested it I've no actually there's no space I did attest to this let's treat a beta version of anything so okay is it does have a detailed documentation about how you how you would use those kind of parameters to help you search but that's not my focus today so I'm not going to waste time there yeah so I'm now just gotta go into one of the record for example for caffeine the organization of the data is looks much better than if you are looking at we're looking at it two years ago so they have this these little icons that to help you to organize and have this leading section summarize some important information and just like Wikipedia has the little brief information for someone who needs to know some basic information about it and then then the next would be the major part of the record before we go to the details I want to point out that since this is a freely available database you will be able to download anything you see so the download it's you can choose to download the all the data used it for the whole page or just different sections and so for the structures you could download it it is very different for various different formats and for content down there you can also do Jason XML and so so it's you're not only time the data but also the semantics behind it so you can reuse them in any way you want that's the benefit of this database which all the other commercial databases would not have yeah now if we go to and before I forget if I go to those details of the sections I do still want to emphasize how how the pubchem data are connected so remember I said that they are connected to the substance information and also the bioassay information so for so for the substance information if you look at the section 5 the related records and the force section of the accessor and 5.3 of the section you will see that it has a lot of related substances records there are more than a thousand records era which means that there could be a lot of Records for caffeine as a substance from all different kind of sources and the critical mixtures include containing caffeine or sometimes its structure similar to caffeine molecule and they are all indexed as the substance is but they are all connected to this compound information so when you need to find is exactly who who deposited what from which source you can use this browsing by substance and find out exactly which which source provided what kind of substance information okay yeah and the second part of the connection as we mentioned it has the bioassay connection and it's under this section cut biological has two results and if you go there you see that all the bio sa information about this this compound is linked to here you can click on those bio I say AIT to go into each experiment to see what what-what was down and the details of Inglis bow as a record varies a lot depending on which deposit depositor provided them so this one is fairly brief so you don't have too much information there but some records have very extensive description about how they performed the experiments and so on yeah so I'm coming back here any questions about how data are connected in Pupkin okay okay let's go back to the top of the record and I can use this button to come back to so first section is more structures and names and identifiers you can manipulate this 3d in conformation um is all this platform and also I'll point out later but under is the properties other colors the physical properties section they also linked to the crystallography data on the Cambridge crystal logger is crystallography data center so that so that you can go browse the crystallography data there are two so yeah and remember I mentioned that only only those names and synonyms showed up in there indexing can be searched when you type in the keyword search in the search box and so the here is where you can see what kind of synonymous they have indexed with a particular sub come hunt yeah and if we go to the chemical and physical properties and they would show the computed while and experimental well and and here I do want to mention like this question mark here for coming with each heading you can click on them it will show you what do they mean by that term and also show sometimes show you how they calculated all those parameters out so to try you can use them when you navigate and here is also opportunity to point out that see what when they pull up data for example here is the color of this compound they also pull out the original source of it a new addition they tell you which database for which data source they got this information from so it's a fairly complete provenance track so you know where people first mentioned it and where it was indexed and then put a bit later by PAP Cal so it will be very helpful if you need to decide if you want to use the data or not and can always go back to the original source yeah so yeah the properties that has those properties that you often need to use for calculations or experiment or designing Anusol and good thing is they always provide provide different data points to and you can just decide which one is closer to the use case you have but the difficult part is always because it comes from so many different types of sources so the units are very so wearing so much it's being a challenging for them they they are trying to develop some algorithm which can extract those units out and try to convert data between different sources so that you can do a better comparison more directly instead of you take it and calculate it later but it is being a challenge for them okay next well here this is the Christmas crystal structure link I was talking about and links choose associate are associated article reported that crystal structure and also to the CCDC repository to to tell you to browse and we realize that pink crystallography structure and form for spectra they do a lot well often times you will see a thumbnail of spectra if they do have yet but mostly it's just going to be a reporting number or a link to where the spectra is so yeah and yeah the first section is the substance as we talked about how they linked and it also provided links to other entrez databases just as any other interest databases you often used and in when you do a downloading here sometimes you may also are also be downloading these records so be careful yeah be careful when you just hit the downloading the whole page because this section could become very huge that slows down your downloading and you may want to tell you to to exclude that section okay yeah and these are the vendors provided information and they do have individual contact with all these different kind vendors so the they do very curated extraction of information rather than just go to those vendors webpage to extract and seven section is the drug information they recently added all the FDA orange bulk information which could be very helpful when you are doing drug drug development and as you as you mentioned that they are so brought in the horn looking for the drug bank information did I already past that yeah well this is probably a good cake good good point for me to introduce in this part so on the bottom of the page there is section called information sources lists out all kinds of sources they used to populate this page and we do see that drug Bank is one of them that they used to populate the page yeah so let me go back to that section we were at which is drug and I'm gonna go to the next one is which is pharmacology Oh we'll have to scroll down that yeah I mean considering I'm not gonna go through the the sections one by one it's gonna make you dizzy anyway the next session I want to animation a little bit is the safety and hazardous section they recently added that jsj chase classification and they also have this kind of classification for meant from many different countries or depending on the compounds so that can be helpful when you are considering safety scenario in your lab and one more thing I would like to mention is they now have a actually it may not be under this section yeah so this kind of storage conditions and the handling notice you might want to check if you happen to need to use a new chemical in your lab but so what I do want to mention is I'm gonna go back to the top of the page so here there is a link on the top section cut safety summary its laboratory chemical safety summary this is a special type of format coming up by the chemical safety community just to provide crucial information people need to make safety related decisions so because they don't want a huge page that they were they need to dig through all those data to find them but rather they just try to pull the most important data because you see exposure limits and so just put them together to help make a safety related decision so this is kind of an example of what people can do with the information indexed in the pubchem database and they are open for any collaboration that they would be happy to cut creating this kind of customer customize the view if you have a special needs in your community that needs specialist play yeah so that's the safety section um and we talked about yeah similar to toxicity most toxicity data coming from the EPA publications and then they linked they have sections specific for literature coming from PubMed is usually then patterns I think our patents linking data coming from somewhere else I am not quite sure which exact source they used the high might be just a lot of sources they used in combination but they do try to link data to two patents yeah and we're talking about about acid test result and they also have a different section for the bio system and have pathways linking and they are working on a different summary page which they call a target summary so by I think what they are trying to do is to make it easier when you try to browse targeted protein or anybody or genes that relevant to a particular compound it would be easier to do for now it takes a lot of clicks I am not very good at that yet so I'm not gonna show you right now but if you're interested in that you please let me know yes so essentially if you if you well there's no active ones but supposedly they are doing that summer page just try to make that easier so when we now if you want that information you'll have to go to well I don't have an active one so if there is an active one then you can hopefully you can go to the active one and it's because it's linked to where is it hmm maybe because it's not active oh these are active yes again I'm not very familiar with this and I'm hoping that they would come up with that summary they were talking about so you can easily browse to the similar activity there was measure look like on mice yeah specific biological molecule to link to right way they're reporting but you'd open the other one that you can get receptor and a link here so yeah here in Spore but this is coming from drug Bank though these are the targeted receptors that if you click on them then yeah yeah he takes you to other yeah but these are these are yeah but these are you drunk bank now it's not no longer in pubchem what they are talking about is they would have a pubchem page that pulled together information from other places and also their own valises data okay yeah I guess we're almost through this all these sections and the last thing here we may be interested is the classification part but in order to show you how that would help I'm gonna go back to the pubchem homepage and there is a classification browsing function if you go to the classification browsing function and it will allow you to browse the database with all the oncologists they have used to populate the database including what they call the pop kam POC so if I go to the pubchem compound you see and these are the section headings we saw just now to organize the page and if for this moment if I want you just to see all the compounds that has safety information for let's say the first eight measures and I can click on this and it's gonna give you all the compounds has that particular section yeah so that's one more thing and sorry yeah now let's go to our ok well now I we're gonna move on to our last part today instead of going for the diamond part I would come back to my slides and just to show you a few things that relevant to batch let's download and programmatic retrieval and pubchem has a very developed RDF project so essentially they have a goal which is to trying to help researchers to use the pubchem data more with mathematics so they they are hosting order rdf and then you can download it and try to navigate it through and see how it can work with your system better yeah they're in yeah it's just this is just a link to where you can download the RDF data rref structure framework from their FTP site and for the for the programmatic access based on that and they have a particular service called power user gateway and the the particular server they're using a spark plug rest so essentially you use URLs to you use URLs to retrieve a batch of information there however this is still not designed for very large volume requests if you do like what they meant inside if you are downloading thousands or tens of thousands of compounds at once then this is probably not the best way to do it they are encouraging you to contact them directly to find better ways to do it and I am happy to make connections I know sometimes writing to the helpdesk in general doesn't connect you to them they're fast but I have some collaboration with the pubchem team so if you want to reach them in person sue and I can help you with that so just shoot me an email um yeah so to come up with with this request many of you are probably very good at this already but they have a very detailed tutorial if you need to design one to go through this kind of fetch and the output can be all different kinds of format depending on what section you're requesting and you can get a broad range of data if you know the CID renji series the compound ID which is a unique identifier identifier and they use internally but they also tried now try to make it operable operable form any sources for example if you go to Wikipedia you'll find that is a pop Kem CID is oftentimes indexed with with the compounds there yeah so um well before I wrap up such I guess do you do any search just using using pug can you only get known item records or can you also run searches oh yeah I think you can run searches actually they even have an interface here to allow you to write that write that query by typing the your missus only IDs I thought they would allow you to do yeah this is already sorry I came to the wrong place yeah I I do believe that you can do searches they did not mention here yes so they have very thorough documentation power user gateway and also this publication linked here has has a very detailed description of how they have they wrote the server and so yeah I I do believe you can do searches I mean they say here you can do a structure search but I would say that search is limited to the scene audience again like it's not true keyword search for all the data in on the page would be only the the synonymous you know names yeah which yeah may not be very helpful but again they are because I know the team a little bit so they are very open to any collaboration so if you have a particular search criteria you would like to do things about then I can the connections yeah plus we may have a quick answer right away yeah um yeah last thing I want to mention is about if you did find the data you want to use they have recommendations on how to cite it and in fact on each page of the record they oftentimes provide this quick link to show you how exactly you would cite the data she's helpful okay yeah I guess that's a majority of the same side I want to talk about and here are the resources I hope it would be helpful for you and they have a good blog that they keep you posted on their latest development and this last link here links to a little online essay on it's part of online course that described all kinds of open chemical databases and there's the these are many of them are sources for pubchem but some of them may have unique information too so it may be helpful for you if you wanna to oversee like what kind of open data available for small molecules okay so that's that and again if my takeaway from today is really Popkin data is much better displayed now and they are really connected so I hope that you guys would find it inspiring just to see if you can explore any in a way to project out of this yeah and last I want to thank a few pubchem staff members who helped me to make the presentation and also work with me for automatic collaborations and thank you very much and if you have questions please [Applause] so there is a way for you to upload chemical structures so you mean you have the you have the chemical structure file name let's want to Lamy itself you can just put them in a txt file and then you can I think you can upload it somewhere not here now we need to go to the power user gateway and they would tell you oh yeah everything's open all Popkin yeah so once you upload that at least they would give you they would send you back a list of see IDs where they can find a match but if they cannot find that scenario then then they just say no no CID for it but if they can't they will give you a list of CID and with the CID you can use query to get the data article ID so so it was you I see so once you get the hunk MC ID then you can query you can query the reference set so if you go back to individual record you see that each one has the literature section right so once you have the CID you can specify with the URL that you want to download the literature part the way it's done sure but yeah and if you download the literature part you will get the so that's what I well so you if you write that if you use the Patras to request you can putting a range of see IDs so you can download a lot of things at once but if he becomes too huge yes okay then then you know I can I see I can connect you with I confronted you with the pubchem people to see if that's possible and to see how how we compare some of the other plate other parts of ends you can go and get the actual data for a whole database yeah it may be these things yeah yeah they do provide what you're trying to ask yeah they'll provide their full database in the pubchem FTP but it you will need some good tool to download them rather than the browser yeah but they do provide FTP service over 1% of the total database well total remember what what we discussed about like the number of compounds is this much but the number of substance is much more huge so yeah I guess if you're looking for compounds that there may be a lot of things missing from your set I mean from their site for your he must right but yeah let me connect you with the staff member there as they say should be any other questions thank you thank you [Applause]
