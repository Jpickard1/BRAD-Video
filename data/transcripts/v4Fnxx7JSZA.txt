welcome everyone thank you for joining us for the dcmb seminar series and ccmb seminar series it is my distinct pleasure to introduce dr francesca luca just to give you a little bit about her background she did her undergraduate degree in biology at the university of calabria in italy she also did a master's degree there where the topic was fine analysis of human molecular diversity in italy looking at snips on the y chromosome she did her phd also at university at calabria in molecular biopathology then she moved across the atlantic and did a post-doctoral fellowship at the university of chicago then in 2012 she started her own independent lab at wayne state university where her primary appointment is in the center for molecular medicine and genetics and she has a secondary or joint appointment in the department of obstetrics and gynecology um fast forward to 2018 she was promoted to associate professor with tenure and in both of those primary and secondary appointments um dr luca's research is at the intersection of statistical genetics and functional genomics where she has reported a number of exciting manuscripts that i always follow her research um where she tries to understand how genetic variation within and across populations can influence complex traits in a gene environment especially in an environment-specific context she has editorial roles on numerous different journals she's been a member on many different nih study sections and she's an overall exceptional scientist so welcome dr luca we are very excited to hear about your latest research and i'll turn it over to you now thank you very much steve for inviting me and for the introduction i'm gonna share my screen now sorry okay there we are um can everybody see my screen well okay good um all right so i'm really excited of presenting my work here today um you know as like a next-door neighbors of uh almost um as we are um and so before um before going into the science i wanna give like a brief oops a brief introduction of what my sorry technical issues of my research program um so as steve was mentioning we are interested broadly in general interaction in molecular phenotypes and complex traits and we can work on a cardiovascular disease and asthma and i'll tell you more about it during um during my seminar today we've also applied the framework of gene environment interaction to study functional genomics of host microbiome interaction um and we also have an interest in the characterized in the function and the evolution of non-coding variants but um today i will i will focus on our uh g biology environment interaction work and so um as we all know especially in this audience genomic association studies have been successful in identifying thousands of genetic variants that are associated with human phenotypic variation and from integration of genome-wide association study results with expression quantitative trait lockus mapping results we also know that much of the phenotypic variation um is actually due to changes in gene regulation so that uh one of the most common framework for understanding um the genetic genetic variation role in complex trait is that we have regulatory variants that modify binding of transcription factors which in turn affects gene expression and ultimately leads to individual variation in complex strains now however we also know it's very very very well accepted broadly accepted that genetic is just one side of the story and that really what determines human phenotypic variation it's not only our genotypes but importantly our the environment and the interaction between our generic makeup and the environment we are exposed to despite this um broadly and widely accepted notion we have really very few well characterized gene environment interaction in complex traits on the other hand uh where we've been along or oh i'm sorry this is blurry uh where we've been a lot more successful is in uh studying genomic interaction at the molecular level and i apologize for the quality of this figure it didn't look like that on my screen but one of the approaches that's been most successful both in our hands and in the hands of many other researchers um is using a responsive qtl mapping as a way to identify gene environment interaction in gene expression and specifically with this approach what we do is considering two different contacts or treatment conditions and performing eqtl mapping um in other words looking for association between genotype engine expression and comparing whether this association is present in both condition or if it's condition specific in this case we have or we should be able to see in theory that there's an association in the treatment condition between a number of copies of the minor allele engine expression but we don't see one in the control so this is what we will call a responsibility or a contact with utile or i think the most recent name is dynamic eqtl uh for for this um this specific phenomenon so uh leveraging uh these and similar approaches that i'll tell you about in a minute we've been working on studying gene environment interaction in molecular phenotypes and then using that information to learn about gene environment interaction in complex traits and so this is sort of the general framework that we've been working on where we study molecular phenotypes that include um chromatin accessibility transcription factor binding gene expression and rna processing and then we look for genetic and environmental effects and then interaction on this gene regulatory mechanism identify gene environment interaction in this molecular trait and then use this information to learn about the role of dbi in complex traits so an outline of what i'm going to be talking about today i will be focusing on the two uh main projects um g by a crossover and environmental context in cardiomyocytes and g base psychosocial experiences and asthma risk so these are really two um uh different aspects of our work engine environment interaction and the reason why i've decided to present this is because this is work from two students that have very recently graduated from my lab anthony finley and justin respect and they completed this work during the last year and a half of pandemics i'm really really proud of you know the exceptional work and you know i was trying to pick between one of the two brazilians and i was like well you know i'll tell you boss and the other reason why i wanted to tell you about um these two projects because we actually just heard that uh we will be funded by nih to continue both line of research so we're actually looking for post-docs to continue the exceptional work that um dustin and anthony have been doing and then i hopefully will have time to also tell you a little bit about some of the our first follow-up work that we've been doing incorporating single cell technology into the stereo gbi as well as transcriptional variability and that's work led by uh justina and julongue who's a postdoc in our lab all right so um ideally to study gene environment interaction we would like to be able to measure all possible environments that we are exposed to in our life and um precisely characterize um our complex rate of interest and then look for this this interaction effects however this is very hard for a number of reasons including difficulties in measuring environmental covariance as well as difficulty in defining precisely phenotypes so one of the approaches that we've been using in the lab as i mentioned before is to focus on molecular phenotypes and so um in the two projects that i'm gonna be talking about today um this first one uh is not only we're looking on molecular phenotypes but we're also considering what we call cellular environment so the idea here is that um as i said ideally we would like to measure um the complex environment they represent our lifelong exposures but um one difficulty is um getting an accurate measurement of that environment so we can go around this difficulty by focusing on cellular environment which are essentially treatments that we can apply to cells and so the advantage of using this approach is that we can tightly control the environment of course the drawback the limitation rather than the drawback is that we can only look at one treatment at the time meaning we cannot really um model the complexity of the environment and then once we've done this study then we can go from the molecular phenotype to the um complex trait in the organismal environment so um as i mentioned before uh there's already been some work uh looking at gene environment interaction um using uh focusing on molecular phenotype and in vitro treatments um and the the most used approach is responsive utl mapping however one limitation of responsive qtl mapping is that this approach doesn't scale well when we want to look at a large number of environment and so in one of the first big projects that i did in my group we really wanted to cast a broad net to get a better sense of the relevance of gene environment interaction on molecular and complex traits and so we um in that project we focused on 250 environments but if you want to do an eq telemapping study and say you want to use a minimum of 100 individuals there will be 25 000 experiments so you have to do in the lab which it's you know you don't want to be the student that has to do that experience right so um what with the silence that is to use a different approach and an approach it is now being used by other groups as well which is called a little specific expression so the idea here is that if we focus on a transcript where there's a heterozygous site we can um measure the expression of each alleles and so in a in the absence of a regulatory variant for that gene we will have a similar number of reads coming from each uh other and a while if there is a lick imbalance then we will see um an excess of leads from one allele compared to the other now if we have a gene environment interaction that will be a pattern that will be specific to for example a treatment condition and will be absent for example in a controlled condition and so this is what we've been uh we're now got used to call conditionally specific expression uh or context specifically specific expression so in other words it's a measure of gene environment interaction and the advantage of using a little specific expression is that it can be measured even in a single individual so we don't need to do the 25 000 experiments that i was talking about before as long as that individually cytozygous variants in coding regions and the second advantage is that because we are comparing the two alleles within the same individual we are essentially fixing all the trans effects and so we um you know does become negligible and so we have power to detect um a little specific effects so um in our original study um we explored 250 environments we were which were the combination of 50 treatments and much control in five cell types and one of the major results was that 50 of the genes with gene environment interaction are in genomic regions that are associated with complex straight that essentially contains us hits one limitation of this first study that we did was that we couldn't really disentangle um what where the cell type specific effect compared to the tremendous specific effect which was um we thought was a very interesting interesting question um so in order to be able to better characterize alien specific expression and the relative contribution of cellular and treatment effects we design a new study which is a study where we are using ipsc's technology and the advantage of using ipsc is that now we have different cell types from the same individual so um in this case we focused on six cell types um sorry three cell types from six individuals so we had the ipscs we had the lymphoblastoid cell lines for which the ipscs had been derived and then from icepieces we differentiated cardiomyocytes we then applied um 28 treatments to um to this um different cell types with a study design where we had two replicates for each treatment so um this is how we like more of a technical aspect how we uh run this set of experiments in the lab but we have these like units where we have on each plate to three individuals and then in this case we had a replicate of the plate and we were careful to um process different cell types on the same day so that we didn't have a batch of factor they might confound any cell type effect um all right so of the 28 treatments that we used uh we identify a strong transcriptional as well as splicing response for 12 treatments and here i'm reporting the number of differential express genes on the laptop of differential splice genes and so these treatments included a few different type of chemicals we had chemicals that are broadly used um such as caffeine or nicotine where there's like an abrupt exposure we had some over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen um some hormones which um you know they can be seen as a pharmacological treatment like the examination as well as an endogenous exposure because the dexamethasone is actually um a glucocorticoid which is um the same molecule as cortisol the same type of molecule as cortisol which is the stress one of the stressor hormones in our body okay so to identify gene environment interaction through asc we first use an another model to detect shifts in a little specific expression um and so we identify over 5 15 000 snips with asc we then use a linear model to specifically um test for gene environment interaction where we have a cell type of factor treatment effect as well as an interaction between cell type of treatment and so these are the numbers that we get we find a very large number of environment interaction and this this we have genotype by cell type genotype by treatment and genotype by treatment by cell type so this would be tremen specific um genetic regulation of gene expression that is also cell type specific um so what as you can see the largest uh contribution to um gene environment interaction measured by sc seems to come from cell type but one one interesting aspect is also that we have quite a bit of signal and we think that that's because of the specific study design where we had essentially numerous replicate represented by the different treatments that we were using so this is a bar plot of conditional asc for treatment in red and treatment by cell type effect in green across the different treatments all right so one um one question in the eqtl mapping field is um you know how many how many eqtls are out there do we need to still keep looking for eqtls and so um that you know the simple answer that we got essentially from gtx is that pretty much each gene has an eqtl um so the question is are we done then do we know all of them and we found all of them and so um the brief answer is no i really don't think so uh but now i'm gonna try to walk you through why i think that's the case so um what we did here is ask the question of of whether the um gene environment interaction that we find in our study which in the end of the day are really um evidence of the presence of regulatory variants are already were already discovered in gtax and the answer the short answer is no that's not the case but most importantly what we find is that while genes that have a little specific expression which is not conditional on the treatment are enriched in in gtaxycutial but when we look at eqtls in heart tissue as well as when we look at a little specific expression uh when we consider genes that have gene environment interaction in our dataset we don't find an enrichment and we've done it best for the cardiomyocytes comparing to the heart tissue and gtex but we also considered ips cysts compared to the i2 qtl study and for lcls compared to the juvaric studies which is an acute level status um in in lcls so it's not really just a cell type um result but it's it applies to all the three different cell types that we've studied and so almost 50 percent of the genes that we found with gbi were not found previously in gdax and so um what what this tells us is that well first of all even with only six individuals we are able to identify instances of gene environment interactions since regulatory potential regulatory variants they were not capturing much larger studies and the reason why we were able to do that is because we are looking at a variety of different environments and so what one of the main results of this study we believe is that it is important to continue exploring different environments because there's quite a bit of genetic variation out there that has an effect that is context dependent and needs to be found because it might be important for complex straight variation so um our study design also allowed us for the first time to investigate um one feature of a little specific expression and so in other words how valuable it is and so more broadly asking the question of um what are the factors that contribute to variation in a little specific expression and so um the largest two components that contribute to variation in ac are cell type and treatment as you can see here however there is also a very large fraction of variation in analytic expression they seem to be due to unknown factors this is what here i'm calling residual values um interestingly this residual variance is actually correlated between cell types so it's not just noise that we're measuring it is something that is conserved across cell types and so might actually be biologically relevant so to try and understand a little bit more about um the biological features um and and the and the mechanism that might contribute to variation in magnitude and variance of asc what we did was to look at different functional categories um so we partitioned essentially the genes by whether they were differentially expressed by the features of their promoter whether they contain a tata box or they had a gc reach promoter um whether the gene was differentially spliced if it was tolerant or loss of function um mutations um the functional relevant of the gene whether it was a gene responsible for cardiomyopathy in mendelian diseases so whether uh it's a gene associated with complex trait interscription word association studies and we also looked at evolutionary significance of the gene by looking at the ideas so then we asked whether the treatment component or ac or the residual component of ac or the mean asc increased or decreased in genes that had these specific features so here's an example for differential expressed genes we subdivided genes in non-being differential expressed being differential expression being highly differentially expressed and as you can see here um the treatment component of the variance in asc increases with um highly differentially expressed gene the residual component of the variance increases as well as well as the amino asc but in other cases we find different patterns so for example for genes associated with complex trait we find a decrease of residual variance and mean asc when the genes are actually associated with complex traits so um what is the clinical relevance of this allele specific expression and this gene environment interaction that we've identified so first of all we looked at the cell type specific effects in the genetic regulation of gene expression in cardiomyocytes and we found an enrichment for heart rate um it is interesting because we also looked at other traits of relevance for cardiovascular disease and we actually only found enrichment for heart rate which is the phenotype where there is a direct involvement of the cardiac muscle which um the cardiomyocytes are part of we also identified three genes that cause mendelian forms of heart disease and that have gene environment interaction and i'm showing here too uh one for nicotine and one for copper so um the reason why this is interesting is because um one possibility is that these genes that are involved in mendelian forms of heart disease may actually also be relevant for non-mendelian forms so um common common forms of heart disease when the individual is in a specific environmental context and then finally we also partition irritability for several complex traits and we found that there is significant contribution to the irritability of blood pressure for genes that have gene environment interaction for vitamin a copper as well as zinc so overall um this study showed that gene environment interaction for a large number of cellular contexts can be detected by a layer specific expression i show you that the largest fraction of gba is the result of cell type specific genetic effects but there is substantial gene environment interaction with treatments as well and finally i show you that treatment-specific genetic effects may modify cardiovascular disease risk um and this is shown by our study of uh evitability partitioning as well as our overlap with mendinan forms of cardiovascular disease all right so i'm gonna be moving now to a project where rather than considering uh in vitro exposure we have actually been considering um organismal level exposures and so not all exposure can actually be modeled in vitro uh by specific treatments and so here for this project in particular we're interested in psychosocial experiences and asthma risk and so we know that psychosocial experiences can affect health can affect health at multiple levels so when i'm talking about psychosocial experiences i'm talking about um for this specific project three different type of experiences one is what we call social relationships such as for example social isolation uh one is emotion sorry emotionality such as anxiety and then sort of kind of more objective measures of um social experiences such as such economic status so um we know from other studies and from epidemiological studies and studies in psychology and sociology as well that um these experiences affect um heart disease affect asthma um however we don't know what is the mechanism and so our hypothesis is that um this psychosocial experiences affecting expression and ultimately leads to variation in in health individual depending on their experiences so um the specific questions for this project are is what are the contribution of genetic variation in the psychosocial environment to inter-individual variation in asthma symptoms and severity and so the reason why we focused on asthma is because asthma is one of the leading cause causes of hospitalization as well as absence from school in children and um there's a higher prevalence of asthma in urban in urban context and and such as the detroit area the metropolitan detroit area so we did this project in collaboration with colleagues in the department of psychology at wayne state and they were really interested in understanding how um the social experiences may affect asthma risk in children while we were more interested in trying to understand whether there was a molecular connection that went through gene expression so uh the name of the project is aloft it's a multi-year project that started um in 2008 uh 2009 um so i i joined the project in 2014 um and the goal of this project was to monitor and uh sample longitudinally 200 more than 250 asthmatic children um that had 10 to 17 years old and that um lived in the metropolitan detroit area so one key feature of this study is that we have very extensive medical and psychological information so our colleagues in psychology did an amazing job in recording not only questionnaires but the children were also wearing an electronic device similar to an ipod uh that would record um sounds and noises in the household for like a minute at the time and then they would decode um these um recordings to obtain an objective measure of family relationship and then social experiences that these children were having on our end uh we collected blood from from this individual from which we isolated dna we isolated rna from leukocytes um we also had blood composition for a subset of the individual we did test of glucocorticoid resistance and we measured the um gene expression genome-wide as well as um genotyping okay so um i told you at the beginning that one of the difficulties when dealing with organismal level type of exposure is that they're hard to measure and so one of the first first tasks for this project was um you know one finding a way to deal with the fact that um the dataset was not complete for some individual we were missing um the psychosocial information um in some cases because it had not been entered in the database yet and in other cases because it was it was just missing it was not recorded but on the other hand um the other the other um feature of this type of studies is that the master of the psychosocial variable is inevitably noisy because if it's a diary it relies on the child uh remembering the experiences of the last two weeks even the objective recording from the year is a little bit more objective but there's still a certain level of noise um that that it's um just inherent to the variable and so uh we used uh jlm nut um to um define um gene expression signature of this exposure and so the idea here is that this would allow us to essentially increase our sample size by being able to predict the exposure for individuals for which we don't have a measurement and on the other hand because it's a transcriptional signature that is based on gene expression only it is essentially a measure of the gene expression effect of that variable which is denoised from other factors the my affected variable and so um this is the cross-validated correlation for the different types of transcriptional signatures as expected we have uh you know we we had most success with a gene expression signature for blood composition because of course it's the one that it's you know molecularly closer to gene expression but overall we were able to um predict uh transcription signatures for several psychosocial variables as well as well as clinical variables and so here's an example of the transcriptional signature for pulmonary function so this is the transcription technology this is the measured from pulmonary function and you can see there's a very good fit to validate the transcriptional signature we also had longitudinal data for these individuals and so we derived the description of signature at time point zero and then we had a gene expression data uh one year later and two years later for the same individual and so here an example of uh variation in the transcriptional signature for the proportion of neutrophils and this is the actual measured variable and so you can see that in this case there's also a very good correlation so um we then asked whether this transcription and signature are correlated with each other so the idea here is that if with the transcription on signature we are capturing the um effect of the exposure on gene expression if we find that these signatures are correlated with each other then it is likely that those two exposures or those two phenotypes actually share um a molecular mechanism and so um what we find here is an example what i'm going to show you here is an example where we have a transcription signature for socioeconomic status which is um correlated with a description signature for self-disclosure now self-disclosure is to which extend um the the children were talking about their own feelings and their own thoughts to other people which could be their peers or their female so what we find is that these two psychosocial variables are actually also correlated with two biological variables which is the percent neutrophils and the percent new lymphocytes in in the blood and they are also correlated with asthma severity as well as pulmonary function now we're not you know we cannot say what's the cause and what's the effect here but what we can say is that there seem to be a shared transcriptional profile and that is associated with all these variables and so um the question you know one potential interpretation that of course needs to be validated is that um these psychosocial experiences may have an effect on gene expression through changes in cell type composition which ultimately leads to some of this clinical phenotype that are important for asthma which are severity as well as pulmonary function um so we then asked whether genes that are differentially expressed in response to these psychosocial experiences whether they are known to be relevant for asthma as well as other allergic diseases and so for to ask this question we used um data from a t was a description by the succession study uh project that we've done with our collaborator willian wan here university of michigan um and um well what you can see here in this plot on the left in this column we have the psychosocial variable that connects to the gene that are differentially expressed as a function of this variable and then on the last column we have the complex straight and so the connection between the gene and the complex straight is whether there is a significant ah t was a result okay and so the way to interpret is is that now we have subjective socioeconomic status for example and the expression of um this gene of pfk fb3 is associated with subjective such economic status in our population and now we also know that the expression of this gene is associated with high fever allergic rhinitis and eczema so um we we are now making connections between uh psychosocial variables that is associated with changes in the expression of that gene and knowing that the expression of that gene is actually important for this complex trait um and specifically for asthma but we want to go one step further and ask can we identify gene environment interactions or can we identify genetic variants where there is an interaction between genotype and the psychosocial signal uh the transcriptional signature for psychosocial variables so um we use this model where we have the genotype dosage prescription signature so the psychosocial variable and then an interaction between genotype and the psychosocial variable and so this is the number of gene environment interaction that we find um and so um we find gene environment interaction for cell type composition which is not surprising um you know one way to think about our transcriptional signature is that it's similar to what people have been doing with the convolution of cell type composition in volcanisic data it's it's essentially the same um type of uh computational problem solved in a very similar way and so this is not surprising this is what you would call possibly a cell type specific eqtl um and but but what's interesting is that when you go here into this um green uh area these are the um gene environment interaction with the psychosocial variable and so we find 44 socio-economic status supported for self-disclosure another psychosocial variable for which we see quite a bit of of important results is maternal responsiveness or parental responsiveness so to which extent the pattern responds to the child um feelings needs requests and so on and then down here we have the gene environment interaction with one of the clinical variables so the fdvs that pulmonary function is a measure of pulmonary function and so we also find in environment interaction for these more clinical variables so i'm going to show you an example here um of um a g by e for this gene gas 8 which is a gene that from tiwas we know is associated with asthma and specifically um higher um expression of of this gene is associated with sorry lower expression of this gene is associated with an increased asthma risk as you can see here from this um red triangle so um law expression is higher risk um and what we have here in this plot so we have um on the horizontal axis socioeconomic status for each individual each dot here is an individual and then on the vertical axis is the normalized gene expression for this gene and so what you can see here is that the allele here increases expression of this gene only with individuals that have high socioeconomic status and so because high expression of the gene is actually protective for asthma based on tiwa's here we have essentially a potential interaction uh not only on gene expression but possibly on the disease outcome uh because we know that high expression um of the gene is protective for asthma risk and we also know that the a genotype from our data what you can see here is associated with either expression of the gene for individuals that have a perceived high socioeconomic status so um what what is then uh what are the implications of some of these results right and so the implications are um you know kind of the broad implication is that um when we consider disease risk um again we should consider not only genetic risk but also how that genetic risk can be modified by a specific environment but then it also has more kind of ethical implication by um you know prompting scientists to say okay then we should consider individualized intervention where um we should take into account not only the risk of that individual to develop asthma but that individual may be at an extreme need of having psychosocial intervention to make sure that the family environment um is less risky for a for a child that might be already predisposed to asthma um and so it's it's something that like as a geneticist it's something you know we don't think all the time but honestly this project really made me think a lot about what could be kind of the broad you know social implication of of the work we do and how important it might be to then collaborate with people that are more you know in this case in the social science um field to think about um targeted intervention they might improve health of of children uh living in um disadvantaged area and so um the summary for this second part is that um social genomics approaches which is an emerging field in in in science in humans can identify potential molecular mechanisms that underlie differences in disease risk um so what i showed you is that psychosocial experiences and asthma symptoms are reflected in blood gene expression and this this in our study specifically in children with asthma we observe that there's a sharing of transcriptional signatures between psychosocial and asthma traits which might point to potential molecular mechanisms that connect psychosocial experiences to health and finally that genetic risk for us minor allergic diseases may actually be modulated by psychosocial factors and i'll show you an example of socioeconomic status but we have several also with other psychosocial factors um all right and i don't have a watch with me um i don't know how we're doing with time it's 4 45 okay so maybe 10 more minutes i wanted to tell you a little bit um about what we're doing in terms of following up on these two projects and so um we are using single cell technology uh to uh study um the effect of the treatment not only on gene expression but also gene expression variability so this this was prompted partly by some of um some um very first papers that came out trying to identify variability qtls but also from our observation for the ipscs and cardiomyocytes project where we saw that there's this widespread variability pathogen expression as well as in the genetic control of gene expression and so um single cell technologies allows us to study induct gene expression variability because now we can measure the expression of individual cells and so we can look at cell to cell variability um in in expression but a baseline as well as in response to a treatment so in a different environmental context and so this is our study design uh we are working on a subset of the of the individuals from the aloft studies so these are the children with asthma that i just told you about and for this project we focus specifically on african-american um uh children it's in general a cohort that it's like over 70 african-americans and then for this specifically it's all 96 participants are african-americans and we um in this case we um expose the cells the pbmcs to treatments in vitro um to simulate infection bacterial infection by treating with lps we also used pha which is a t cell mitogen um and is supposed to stimulate mostly t cells as opposed to dlps and so um we use tanax genomics and we identify four major um cluster cell type clusters the b cell the monocyte anchor in cell and the t cell and we specifically decided to focus just on major clusters because uh we want to um do eqtl mapping and so we wanted to make sure we had enough power to detect eqtls and so in addition to treating the cells so sorry with lps and phi we also treated them with axial medicine which is as i said before a glucocorticoid um and and so it's it's essentially stress hormone so um we're not measuring psychosocial variables here yet uh but uh we have as we have an in-vitro proxy for stress which is dexa medicine okay and so and then as i was saying the goal of this project is to um look at the effect of the treatment so measure shift in expression as well as in variability uh in response to the treatments and so uh what we found is that uh these treatments so both the immunostimulators the lps and the pha as well as dexamethasone which by the way um the role of dexamethasone so i should have said that before the role of dexamethasone is of glucocorticoids in our body so they are released by the hypothalamus pituitary axis in response to stress but they are also released in response to an infection not to activate the immune system but actually to shut down uh the immune system to avoid going into sepsis and so you probably all know that examination is also one of the few drugs that's being used to treat patients with severe covet and that's because one of the main um we now know that people that develop severe carbide essentially develop it's it's a consequence of an exaggerated immune response and so by training those individuals with dexamethasone essentially the immune response gets um dampened gets shut shut down or at least reduced so that um the cytokine storm is prevented um and so what what we found is um that we we have um a strong response to the immunostimulated dexamethasone not only in mean gene expression but also in gene expression variability and so what this bar plot up here is showing is the number of different expressed genes in response to the different treatments the number of differentially variable genes as well as the one the genes that have both differential mean and differential variability and so what's interesting is that we find distinct uh effect on variability which do not overlap to the effect on gene expression or at least not completely and so here are three example genes uh this first gene here type one in t cell um we have the four different treatment conditions alpia salpias plus dexamethasone pha and ph plus dexamethasone and you can see that there's an effect of the four treatment on gene expression um and um it goes in the direction expected so if the gene goes up without yes it goes down with hexamedicine which is what we would expect because up with pha goes down with excel medicine but there's no effect on variability well here we have a gene where there's no effect of the treatments on the mean but there is a fact on variability and again even for variability we do see the same trend where the immunostimulator and dexamethasone have contrasting effect so have effects in opposite direction and this is not just for this gene it's actually a pattern that we see more broadly and then this is a gene where there's an effect of the treatment buffs on mean and variability but they go in opposite direction so one thing i didn't go into the details of how we measure gene expression variability but essentially we control for the mean so that the effects of variability are actually independent from the mean okay we then asked um given that we see this um pretty strong response and variability uh to the environment do we also have a generic control of um gene expression variability and so can we identify variability qtls and can we identify response variability qtls so the answer short answer is yes so again this is a bar plot where we have genes that are only aging so expression jeans with an expression futile which is the darker part of the bar down here then we have at the top of the bar genes that have a variability qtl so we call it a vigin and then the the part of the bar in the middle is genes that have both an expression qtl and variability qtl and so um actually the um genes that have both variables an expression qtl are the smallest proportion of of the three groups so here are some examples and i have um down here uh what are the diseases of traits that these genes are relevant for and um i know these are like examples but i'm going to tell you the message i'm trying to convey and then i will walk through the example so uh what's um what it's appearing from these results um in these these example results and more broadly from our results is that there is um clear effect on gene expression variability of the treatment and the individual genotype and that this is for genes that we know are associated with complex traits based on transcription what association study so the obvious question is then is variability in gene expression another mechanism that might lead to variation in disease status and so these are as i said three example this is a gene associated with asthma and as you can see there's an expression qtl um and there's pretty much no variability qtl this is an example of a variability qtl but no expression futile this is a gene associated with autoimmune diseases so rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and psoriasis and then this is a gene where there's both an expression qtl and a variability qtl but they go in opposite direction and so this gene expression of this gene is implicated in response to hiv infection and finally we also find response variability qtls uh which might take a minute to kind of wrap our head around the concept but the idea is that these are genes where there's an effect of the genotype on the variability of the gene but that effect is only um present when in this case we add dexamethasone to the cultural media so cells that are only exposed to lps there's no effect of the genotype on the variability of the gene but when we add dexamethasone we have an effect of the genotype and the variability of the gene and 11 of these are regions we call them so responsibility genes um i went previously indicated in indian diseases intrascription white association study and so this is really i think one of the very first times that we see these new uh genetic effects on um gene expression in this case variability respond in response to a treatment so um you know the question now really exciting question is what is you know what is their role more broadly in in human human complex straight variation so the conclusion of this third part is that um we detected effects of immune stimuli on um gene expression lolimine but also viability um that there is genetic regulation of gene expression variability and that it is independent on genetic relation of gene expression mean and so these results point to the question of whether gene expression variability may actually be an important additional mechanism for complex straight variation so um big conclusion slide here um so i showed you today um three projects where um some of the main findings are that gene environment interaction measure the molecular phenotypes uh can actually uncover purity mechanisms for complex straight variation the gbi effects may be latent in large uh eqtl studies in a in a single condition but can be detected with smaller sample size if we analyze many contexts and finally that genetic and environmental effects on gene expression variability are a purity of important mechanism for complex straight variation and so uh i like to close by uh with a thank you slide to all the people that have contributed to these projects so i have this figure of this this picture of me um i was at a actually at a camp with my daughter a few years ago cam powell i don't know if you guys know about it it's it's in kind of in between detroit and and arbor and but but uh but i looked back at the discussion i was like this is how i actually been feeling since when the pandemic um uh you know started and and this is how i bet a lot of scientists have been feeling um you know doing acrobatic between dealing with everything going on around us with our personal life our families and and so on and and this has had like a gigantic effect on impact on uh trainees uh and and junior faculty as well and so i really want to acknowledge the work of the students and the postdoc in my lab but that you know they've been able to do science uh despite everything that was going on around us and so anthony um and justina who just got finished their phd anthony is an md phd student who is continuing the md part of his um um courses uh julong who is a postdoc in the lab um cynthia and alison were a student in a postdoc in our group before and um they've moved on but they contributed to the scm project and alan mondani who is now a phd student at the westman institute in in israel he also worked on the cardiomyocyte project and um you know last but not least most importantly um as i know many of you know my group is actually shared with roger pike reggie who is my colleague at wayne state and so this is all work done in club in very close collaboration with him and um i know like steve and many of you know we um share a mentoring of trainees and um we have shared funding for some of these projects and so um certainly this is um this is work this is joint work with him a hundred percent and um it's also been possible thanks to many collaborators um some of whom are there you van william juan and xiang zhu as well as collaborators of wayne state richard slater and sanji lioli for the psychosocial um project and you are killed at the university of chicago for the cardiomyocyte um project and our funding from nih and um i think that's it i'll be happy to take questions hey congratulations that was uh awesome and exciting work thank you so much if you were here in person you'd hear a loud round of applause i have so many questions but i'm also meeting with you one-on-one tomorrow so i'm happy to defer if anyone else wants to ask a question or i'm also happy to start off with a question i i have a question if you have multiple cellular phenotype and they have a sample size probably uh not that great how you are do you have any power analysis for your interaction you mean for the little specific expression yeah yeah yeah that's a good um that's a good question so we haven't actually done power analysis like you know in the traditional in the traditional sense uh but i can tell you what we've learned as we were doing these projects so uh our first project um that i just glanced on we had a lot more environments and we didn't have replicates because we wanted to well let me say it differently we had biologic a reduced number of biological advocates because we had three individuals we didn't have any technical replicate because we wanted to maximize the environments that we were investigating and we did find g by um we did you know we were able to to to say that they are important for um complex traits but um you know they were in the order of hundreds so so three individuals about 30 contacts in the order of like hundreds now the new study um the one that i presented today we had six individuals so twice as many but for each individual we had three different cell types and then we have 12 treatments and we had technical replicates as well and we found g by in the order of thousands now one could say well that may be because of the cell type you used which sure it could be but i'm actually i'm more like inclined to think that it's because of the study design which also allowed us different statistical framework to identify um this conditional asc this g by e because now essentially what we could do was leverage the information across all these different replicates and all had the same genotype so then um you can really um see departure from you know that one-to-one ratio in the in the asc and you had a much better estimation of what was the null like what you would expect um if there was no isc so i don't know if this answer your question directly but um you know it's more what have we learned um more than you know what is like your theoretical expectation is you know whatever thank you uh so so i'll ask one for the um the second story about the psychosocial can you hear me was there someone else i have a question skill thank you very comprehensive uh genetic environmental epidemiology study anyhow um i was struck by the gas 8 story and socioeconomic status um where do you go next on that it's a little hard to change people's social extent this unless you're handing out cash um what is the plan for furthering that interesting observation yeah that's a good um that's a good point so um you know short of not being able to you know do what you just said or change the politics or the social intervention from a scientific point of view we are actually doing a project now directly investigating um how poverty may be associated with gene expression variations so i'm doing a project with a postdoc who i'm mentoring but she's actually from morgan state university and this is a project actually we have we have a poster that we will be presenting at ashg for people that are going there um but so um this is the handel's cohort which is a cohort that was assembled by the national institute of aging and it's a cohort of individuals living in baltimore they were sampled blood samples were taken four to five years um apart so there's two time points and there's individuals living below the census defined poverty lines and individuals living above the census defined poverty line and it's it's a pretty well um sites cohort it's um if i remember currently it's like 250 individuals and so two time points which we are treating as if they were two replicates and now we're looking for gene expression um for genes where there's variation in expression um between individuals living above or below the poverty line and i can tell you we do find some and what's interesting there is that there seems to be a specific effect where um genes differentially expressed in poverty in men are more related with immune system processes while in women they are more related with coagulation and wound healing and and platelets so it's very preliminary um but where to me where you know and and we don't have the genotype data yet so we're not really looking at g by yet but um if those results you know this preliminary results are confirmed i think it's a pretty um you know i don't want to say definitive but it's a pretty clear evidence that um you know the the in that case poverty status which is a much more precise definition as opposed to perceived socioeconomic status poverty status has an effect which i mean of course it doesn't affect our health status right but the fact that it is in addition to the fact that you cannot provide for your own care that you are you know at a disadvantage for access to you know proper medical care and so on there's also direct effect on your biology right on your biological processes um i think that's that that's gonna be that's gonna be pretty pretty interesting and um you know it also opens and windows into like our biology and how you know how much influence there is from from psychosocial factors and psychosocial experiences so um you know it's unfortunate it's not our place to solve those issues but hopefully you know we can point to um we can point to effects um we can we can provide the scientific evidence of the mechanism that social inequalities have on individuals health and hopefully that will make a more convincing case for the need to change certain certain political interventions and social interventions that's a very good statement very good i look forward to talking to you tomorrow just as a quick follow-up to that you can this like really profound implications of this work and i wonder if you envision a day where someone has like an environment specific prs where you can kind of predict which which kind of areas of the environment they might be more susceptible to based just on their genetic variation right yeah ideally that's really what you know we've been talking about we've been talking about it with you know with william juan quite a bit and um that's that's what that's what we would like to be able to do uh that's that's you know we've written it in some grants as well but that's that's kind of what i envision it hopefully this this field going to and um and and you know being able to uh have really individualized uh um not only therapy but also like preventive medicine right that is not just about oh you know you should take the spill or this tablet because you have a higher higher risk for this but you know even just you know we know exercising is good right but i think you can make a much stronger case if you tell people exercise is good but you know if you don't exercise people that have your genetic profession don't exercise have at this much increased risk you know and so as long as it's used in the in a good way i think um i think there's promise for um you know not only exciting science but also translational potential yeah there's a lot of really broad implications i think it's exciting um i have tons more questions but we're going to meet tomorrow so i'm going to withhold them now um and we're a little bit over time but does anyone else have other questions or comments for francesca yeah uh my question is on your emotionality and sas how was that determined is that uh based on the word they live or it's an individual based and at the same time my other question is you know ses is predictive of where you live it's not just direct scs maybe other factors like you know exposure to air pollution or other things so how do you say the effect is really related to sas instead of this multiple confounders yeah that's a good point the confounders um you know for everything that we measured we tried to go to control for um but of course there might be things we haven't measured and that we did we you know we therefore we didn't control for so that's that's certainly one concern there uh in terms of measuring socioeconomic status this was subjective for for the project that i presented was subjective socioeconomic status which is people were shown a ladder um and they said you know on a on a scale from one to ten uh where do you think you'll fit on the ladder and so that's so so that's that's how it was and it's uh i'm told from my psychology colleagues that it's a standard way of collecting uh subjective such economic status uh data in um you know in the psychosocial field the project i was mentioning uh uh before that um you know that it's very premium and didn't show in that case we did have the uh census data and so it was you know more objective and and and uh and it was also the customers it was that are a lot below or above poverty on the poverty line well this one was continuous um on a scale from one to then thank you very much okay we're a bit past the hour and i know there's a number of folks that are going to meet with you tomorrow so i bet you're going to get lots more questions this is uh really exciting work thank you again for speaking at our seminar series and i look forward to meeting with you tomorrow thank you very much thanks for inviting me and uh yeah looking forward to the meetings tomorrow bye bye
