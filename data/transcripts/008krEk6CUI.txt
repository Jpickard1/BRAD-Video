Max is still completing technically but and so Peters gonna talk about parameter derivation in gene regulatory networks so thank you Peter hey thanks for the introduction and it's great to be here and get a chance to interact with the department because I'll also be affiliated with DC MD so a lot of my research interests revolve around getting a multiscale understanding of regulatory networks and especially of bacterial regulatory networks and so my interest in these things starts from a set of experiments as everyone's probably all familiar with on some level and these are the jacobim anode toxic shift experiments so the experiment is just the following it's very simple you take a culture of e.coli growing on a mixture of glucose and lactose of carbon soy and what you'll see is that the cells will grow at some characteristic rate eating all the glucose until it's exhausted and then there will be a lag in growth and then there will be some slower second phase of growth as the cells the brilliance of jacobim node is that they understood what this lag meant and that is that the cells didn't actually make the teams that were required or the gene parts that were required to metabolize the lactose until they needed it and so this is an example of the power of these regulatory networks that they let organisms adapt their behavior to the circumstances they find themselves but this is a very old set of experiments recently we've come to appreciate that there are a lot more subtleties that can be incorporated into these regulatory networks and one of my favorite example but this is what we like to call anticipatory regulation and a great example of this phenomenon is the following if you take e.coli which is a microbe that has spent a large chunk of its evolutionary history cycling back and forth between Ian's being inside the mammalian gut and an outside and an inside and outside if you just take an e coli culture that is growing at room temperature and then you raise the temperature to body temperature you will see the cells shut down their aerobic respiration induce an acid stress response and induce a bio sulfus resistance response so they take all of the steps that are required to survive in the mammalian gut just based on the cue of the temperature rise and so this is a regulatory network that encodes not just information on how to respond to what the cells see but in the meaning of that stimulus in an ecological context and so since this was first really appreciated a couple of years ago people have found this all over the place in microbes from brewers yeast other bacteria and so it's it's a very powerful trend in these regulatory networks and it gives you an idea of the kinds of power of these networks to shape microbial behavior so yeah um we haven't I don't think that the people who did this looked that much as exactly how fine-tuned your response that could do there they were just jumping from 25 to 37 I know 30 to 37 gives you a meaningful huge shock response yeah but but I you know there there's a plain room for nonlinearities and what's going on here so I not know exactly what the sensitivity looks like though and we don't even know if it's just the people haven't even work out if it's the jump or if it's just getting to 37 from somewhere else pretty much which which would make sense since that's the temperature they really have to care about so if we want to understand these regulatory networks and eventually use that understanding to either kill bacteria or make them new useful things which are my ambition we really have to look at all of the different relevant scales and understandings networks on all of the scales that are pertinent to their behavior and so to there are two main ones that I think are important to consider on one level you have to think of these regulatory networks as being a bunch of different biomolecular interactions because that's actually what they are and how they are physically implement but on the other side you have to look at them on the network level because this is where you really actually get the behavior of the regulatory network driving what the cells you and so a lot of my work revolves and is going to evolve around you obtaining a predictive understanding of regulatory networks and bacterial regulatory networks on these scales so that we can predict cellular behavior when they're exposed to new stressors or design modifications to the cells either genetic or chemical perturbations to make them do what we want and so on for the rest of the talk I'm going to go through a few examples that revolve around this theme first I just want to go over a little bit more research that shows just how powerful regulation is in shaping bacterial landscape and then talk about two specific examples on different levels of detail first at the molecular level a post translational regulation of a lipase activity that I think is very interesting and then a method I've developed for looking at Network level effects and especially for identifying all of the protein DNA interactions in bacterial cells under physiological conditions so um just to give more of an appreciation first of the power of these regulatory networks what really got me into thinking along these lines was an experiment that was done in tava Zoey lab before I joined this was done by a grad student named Tonya Darcy and what he did was evolve a population of e.coli to tolerate increasing levels of ethanol and so the idea was you could use this in biofuel applications and so it's a pretty simple experiment you start the cell growing at the most ethanol they can and then slowly raise the concentration on the population and you have all the population that can deal with up to 6 or 6.5 percent ethanol instead of 4.5% and Stephanie used a new method that he had developed to pinpoint the mutations in the genome and the evolved strain that were actually responsible for this phenotype and the most powerful single effect came from a mute point mutation in the gene row you can see this effect here you look at the ability of the relative fitness of the cells in 6.5 percent ethanol the wild-type cells don't grow at all here's the fully evolved strain and here's be fully evolved thing where you only revert that one mutation to row and there's almost a 50% drop in fitness and so the reason this is interesting to me is the role of row is to be a transcriptional Terminator it defines the determinant in the termination site of between 30 and 50% of the cola and all that this role mutation does directly as far as we could tell is increase the read-through of some of those termination sites so all you're going to be doing is a long gating some transcripts and so you can get an idea of what this is going to look like at the molecular level oncome data like this this is from the atlantic lab that was constant um they did chip seek experiments for RNA polymerase occupancy around a known row dependent termination site and under normal conditions you can see a big drop-off an occupancy right after the road row dependent terminations site as you'd expect if you chemically inhibit row with a compound called by cycle niacin you instead see increased read-through and so what we should expect is this real mutation is just going to be causing read-through like this throughout the genome and so what really piques my interest here was first of all how is this six ledge hammer of a regulatory mutation causing the cells to gain so much tolerance to ethanol and since this is going to be a primarily transcriptional effect we think the logical place to start was just to look at transcriptional profiling of these raw mutant cells compared to wild-type cells and you see a couple of interesting things first of all there are about 200 genes out of 4500 or so in the genome that are differentially expressed on and the presence of this under expressed sector about 40 of those 200 or so is actually very interested and the reason for that is that the direct effect of perturbations to row dependent termination as assessed by say that chemical inhibition is just to cause over expression of whatever genes are downstream of the row utilization sites and so this under expressed sector has to be coming from a broader Network level effects as the effects of the initial perturbation to row dependent termination propagate through the regulatory now now if your only goal was to figure out how this real mutation is dealing ethanol tolerance you'd actually be able to stop here because out of the set of genes that are differentially expressed in this row means there is an over expression of a couple of genes that are involved in ethanol catabolism and there is a down regulation of a couple of acid stress response genes that are known to decrease Fitness in the presence of ethanol and so that is how this particular mutation is giving rise to ethanol tolerance is fortuitously it causes a set of gene expression changes that include perturbations that yield ethanol tolerance but this got me very interested in the possibility that the exact same mutation the same perturbations but I'd also give Fitness differences under other conditions because this really is a fairly non and so the way I looked at this was I screamed about 300 conditions to see in what other cases the same row mutation would give and so there were 20 or 25 that had pretty substantial effect here's what you see off of me so what I'm quoting in this chart are the ratio of growth rates between the row mutant cells and the wild-type cells under a wide variety of condition there are two horizontal lines here the black dashed line is what that growth rate ratio is under our reference condition which is this glucose minimal media and the green dashed line is that one is what it would be if there's no with that and so what you see first of all there's a lot of these conditions so there are a lot of cases where this same mutation is causing substantial perturbations either go in both directions there's a wide variety of conditions and what's even more interesting I didn't if you tabulate these conditions where there's a substantial difference in the fitness of itself you will see the same category of stresses show up on both sides highlight all the translational inhibitors there's one where their own mutation hurts you and three where it helps other the panel that I looked at if you look at DNA gyrase inhibitors there is one where the Roma keishon helps you in one where it hurts you and so each of these changes has to be the result of some specific interactions between the particular changes in gene expression that happen from this one mutation and the specific condition that's there and the reason that this is so powerful you think about in an evolutionary context is this is a single mutation to a central housekeeping protein in e.coli and this one mutation can give you beneficial fitness effects under it presumably dozens of different conditions so I found you know 15 or 30 study and certainly didn't saturate all the environments out there so this has to be representative of a huge reservoir of phenotypic diversity that is accessible through point mutations in bacteria that's really pretty scary if you think you know how to stop bacteria from growing under different conditions if they can do a lot so another interesting thing to think about when you're thinking about the evolutionary effects of this row mutation is it doesn't act alone and it actually interacts with a lot of other things in the genome and so for example just looking at you so right for most of this I am defining fitness just as using growth rate as a proxy for fitness you could also do competitive fitness which is just another metric in the limit of infinite times again culture volumes they're basically equivalent the cells are actually directly interacting in some way but these differently coalescing okay so um if we go back for a moment um so I was showing this this little while ago if you take the wild-type cells they can't grow in 6.5 percent ethanol the evolved stream can evolve fearing that the wrong mutation reverted grows but not as well just the wrong mutation by itself and doesn't actually allow the cells to grow at all in 6.5 percent ethanol so there has to be another player also and so you go looking for this I used a fun method called atom to pinpoint in the back in a genetic background of this row means what other mutations in the evolved cells contribute most to the fitness in ifnl concentration here adult experiment points bringing me toward one mutation in the ribosomal protein RP SL and so if you look then at the effects of Rho and RPS L together on the fitness cells or the growth of cells under different condition first of all just looking in rich media or rich media with six percent ethanol which is a little lower than 6.5 percent I was showing before ah the wild-type cells grow the world mutant cells grow we need a better enriched media um in the LB plus six percent ethanol the wild-type self don't grow at all the revolution cells grow although they're not terribly happy and then if I fill out this table with the effects of the RPS L mutation either by itself or in combination with this row mutation RPS L by itself actually gives you a slight decrease in growth rate in rich media and again by itself doesn't allow any growth in ethanol and then you put the two of them together and you get cells with you the worst enriched media but the best in the lb+ ethanol so you have not only direct effects of this real mutation but also condition dependence epistatic interactions with other mutations throughout the genome which is just showing you how quickly you can generate a lot of phenotypic versity do these kinds of new patients ah so just to give even more of an appreciation I'd like to say of the power of regulatory mutations we took this to a broader level and looked at aidid another analysis of knockout libraries selected under different conditions and so yeah the reason this is linked to regulatory mutations is anytime you have a single gene knockout it's basically equivalent to a regulatory network just shutting down that gene and so we were wondering what kind of fitness diversities you could generate just by looking at single B knock knock out and so we looked at 144 different conditions and what I think is very interesting is under all about five of them you could find at least one single gene knockout that improves fitness under that condition and the average is actually quite a few in the order of 20 or so knockouts that are going to improve fitness and so this again is showing you first of all the power of regulation because like I said these are equivalent to just shutting down a gene second it's showing you the general principle that the biochemical capacity of bacterial cells to survive under different different conditions far exceeds what their regulatory network can tell them to do because they're obvious obviously that if you look at this data the cells could be doing better under a lot of these conditions if their regulatory network was doing the right thing with them and also again should scare you in terms of how easy it is to generate phenotypic diversity in these populations because all of these single gene knockouts are equivalent to one nonsense mutation and there are a lot of different ways to generate a loss-of-function mutation so this kind of university can establish itself very fairly quickly you can do the back of the envelope calculation if you're one milliliter of cells in LB which is rich-media you have a single gene knockout for every gene in the genome file and all likelihood so this diversity is already ah and what makes this even more interesting I think if you look at the over representation or under representation of different classes of genes among these genes where we're knocking out the gene gives you beneficial effect the four classes that are significantly over-represented the ones shown in blue here structural genes regulatory genes RNA and enzymes again you see regulators showing up both through their direct effects and indirect effects as being so important to the other patient populations so I think there are a couple of big lessons to take from all of us work on what I could call the adaptive power of bacterial regulatory networks first of all and this comes mostly from the Rho mutation I was talking about mutations the course of course cell functions have a huge variety of fitness effects and can be beneficial under a lot of conditions in the last couple of years people have really appreciated this is not just true Perot but also RNA polymerase mutations lots of other core functions end up getting mutated in bacterial populations that they're evolving under stressful conditions and can let you adapt to put him at them and even true loss of function mutations give you a way to get wrap it out of patients to stressful conditions because again under almost any stress condition you want to throw out there's some loss of function mutation that's going to make the cells do better so um there are a couple of future questions that come up if you look at these that the power of these regulatory networks um some of the things we'd like understand what are the most common mechanisms that are driving these phenotypes how is say this ro mutation exerting its effect under all these different conditions where it ended up helping itself what worldly mutations play in non laboratory evolutions as I was saying we've noticed through a lot of people's experiments over the last couple years that these show up a lot in lab evolution experiments but we don't have enough appreciation yet of how often these kinds of mutations are showing up in say clinical populations and how can we take advantage of all of these different ways to perturb bacterial physiology course a biotechnology applications where we might want the cells to do something um and so a lot of the work I'm going to be doing once I show up here is based around building the quantitative understanding of these regulatory networks that we need to answer some of those questions I'd like to do it in a very using a very we really try to understand everything from the atomic level up to cells and even populations and so there's a broad variety of techniques that certainly I'll be applying and also others not listed here to collaborating with people you have these problems everything from molecular simulation up through laboratory evolution and I'd like to spend the rest of the time I have today talking about two specific examples of using some of these methods to look at very different size scales in regulation and so the first example is just using a molecular simulation to look at the post translational regulation of the activity of a particular light and so light pages are an interesting class of enzymes that are in general going to catalyzed hydrolysis of esters and they generally have very broad substrate specificity if you leave them to their own devices so basically all known why pages undergo something that's called interfacial activation which is a kind of post translational regulation the lipase is when they are in aqueous solution will take on a closed conformation where the active site is covered and the cells can't actually hydrolyze anything this prevents them from targeting anything that they shouldn't but when they are in the presence of hydrophobic hydrophilic interface there's some complication I'll transition that we understand pretty well in some way patients but not so much in others where a lid lifts above the active site and the enzyme become and so you can see how this works very clearly in some lipase crystal structures we have this one is candidate lugo so lipase um and so you can see here's the open state like that color could've put that on the left there's an active site in here and then there's this blue lid domain in the closed state that you get in the absence of an interface you just get coverage of this active site by the lid domain and then the enzyme is basically paddle and so for a lot of lipases you can appreciate how strong this interfacial activation is and it goes from mild to very strong by looking at the relative activity of the enzyme for say a small chromogenic substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of SDS which is going to mimic the effects of the hydrophobic interface on the lipase and so on this key Mikola lipase for example when you titrate up the SDS can get up to about a thirty five fold increase in activity Canada and article I page a does a five a six fold increase and then you have the black sheep of the family it's a Canada Antarctica lipase B which actually does not show any interfacial activation at all in these experiments it's just it's I think it has been for a while the only Poppa lipase that doesn't do this people are aware of and my collaborator Kirsten blank and I got interested in its enzyme because it this behavior is so a typical for lipase but this lipase is very commercially important it's used in a lot of biotechnology applications for its ability to hydrolyze a wide variety of esters and do so in a stereo chemical very specific way and so we wanted to understand at a structural level what is how be doing is they're actually interfacial activation we're not picking up here what's going on and so uh the set of experiments the Kirsten is the group did was the following she took a set of glass beads that were prepared with surfaces of varying hydrophobicity ranging from a C one modification up through C eight and even there they did a CA 18 modification also and then look at the kettle kettle attic efficiency of kalbi for a wide variety of and so it's just just to give a feel for the kinds of substrates they're being used here here a few of them excuse me they are all either criminogenic or chlorogenic and you have from be very small to large in the floor seemed uh butyrate and so if you look at the activity of this enzyme in the present for on different substrates in the presence of different degrees of surface hydrophobicity um if you look at a parametric phenol community for example which is a pretty typical small substrate you see no interfacial activation which is consistent with previous results but you can get up to the bulkier substrate you see that there actually is interfacial activation in this case that you have a huge increase in enzymatic activity for the more hydrophobic surfaces and in fact this actually doesn't even happen nearly to the same extent for FDA how much it has a shorter um and so we wanted to understand how the structural level what's going on with this so Kirstin got in touch with me and we did some molecular dynamics simulations to try and understand a structural level what is causing this substrate dependent interfacial activation and so we started out with just some vanilla simulations to see what the mobility of different parts of it look like and what you see in general the enzyme is very stable there here's the enzyme is the active site and then if you color it by the RMS F on a moderate length like the dynamic objectory you see there's long very mobile helix that looks like it's doing most of the intra and this is additional value should be peeking your interest because this looks exactly like the kind of lid that you see in a lot of other lipases except people thought the kalbi isn't doing any interfacial activation until now so if you get a feel for what this thing could be doing you did then a longer series of replica exchange simulations to get some enhanced sampling and to get a feel for what the the landscape of accessible confirmation looks like in this enzyme and we came out with three basic classes of conformation the first are there are a lot of crystal white confirmations will pretty much like the crystal structure and have a moderately open active site then you have some that have a very highly open active site and then some others when you get a close it looks very much like the closed structures of other life cases and so this enzyme is clearly sampling back and forth between these combination and it's pretty easy to understand if you just look at the structure how this might interact with interfacial activation because just like a lot of other enzymes there's a lot of hydrophobic surface on the lid helix and the other stuff in that area and so you can imagine that it's going to have a effect on the conformational distribution of this enzyme if you have a hydro interface present yeah they were done in the absence of the modeled interface yeah and so I'm going to I did it yeah yeah even in the absence of the interface you're sampling all these different confirmations but and what's interesting if you just take a very crude model then at the interface I pulled out 25 representative confirmations from these simulation and they take a very crude model for the interface for you if you have water you have a hydrophobic slab and you have an impenetrable slab and I'm using this to pretty much mimic the experimental setup and you take empirical values for the free energy effects of burial of different hydrophobic sites or different side chains I should say in the hydrophobics lab you can approximate the effects of this interface on the conformational distribution of the enzyme what you see is the in solution there's a roughly equal population of these three different general classes of structures whereas the presence of the interface drives it strongly toward the more open structures which would be consistent with interfacial activation now this is only actually going to be interesting is if we can close the loop and see how driving things toward the more open structure is going to interact with different substrates so then we docked all the different experimental substrates that we were you that were used by our collaborators to the representative compilations we were looking at and then looked at the distribution of relative binding energies from the docking for different substrates and how that interacts with classy discs so here there are points at all of the catalytically competent bound confirmations that are present showing their relative binding energy through the best binder and then there on the wire at the appropriate position for the klephts distance that you get from the bounce structure so roughly this range is where the crystal structure is these are what I would consider to be the closed structures up here are the open structure and you can see there's not very much presence for the small substrate but in comparison fbb which is the one that experimentally showed the interfacial activation has a much stronger presence the one particularly open structure where actually the lid helix is unfolded slightly and in general has much less ability to bind to the closed structure so it looks like this is going to explain the substrate dependent interfacial activation that you're getting just because the large substrate cannot bind in a catalytic complement catalytically competent way to the code structure of the enzyme which is then destabilized in the presence of the in defense so what do we get from this kalbi is an unusual lipase because it shows substrate dependent interfacial activation it looks like it has this alpha 5 helix that I talked about the acts like the lid domain or the link helix would in a lot of other lipases um but unlike a lot of other lipase is free kalbi can act as an ester ace for small substrates which can apparently get in even to the post structure bulky substrate required lid open so given this there are some interesting follow-up questions to look at such as what's the physiological role of this duet of this dual activity given the most lipases appear to have any facial activation or a reason are they on any other lipases that share this mechanism and how can we use what we now understand about the interfacial activation of kalbi to engineer to improve the about technology application all right so for the rest of the time I have I'd like to shift over to the exact opposite end of my scale and look at the regulatory network level and talk in particular about a method I've been working on during my postdoctoral work or identifying protein DNA interactions in a nonspecific way so what motivated this particular piece of method development was thinking of how you could go about understanding a regulatory behavior that involved a lot of different transcription factors and so this this might be for example the anticipatory regulation example that I was showing at the beginning of the talk where you have a lot of apparently unrelated operons being regulated by a comma stimulus there has to be some interesting regulation going on here there are probably lots of different transcription factors involved and so if you look across the the usual suspects in terms of method you can you are an AC or an RNA microarray and you can see the transcriptional output but this tells you nothing about the molecular logic that's giving rise to that out you could you think expand you could identify for each experiment where a given protein is bound to the genome under a given physiological conditions condition but that means you're doing one experiment for each protein for each condition you have to pick the proteins you want to look at a head of time you may miss something if you don't pick the right ones it ends up being a prohibitive number of experiments so how would we track a complex regulatory response and the answer was to develop a method that lets you get a single profile that shows all of the protein occupancy on the genome under physiological condition and so this is very similar for example to what people can get with DNA's hypersensitivity experiments in eukaryotic cells but it doesn't rely on so the way these methods work is the following you grow the cells under the condition of interest you cross link proteins DNA and so here I'm drawing the DNA as a pair of purple lines and then different proteins as ovals and so you form covalent crosslinking aldehyde or alpha violet light you lyse the cell if you Sonic eight them and then you enzymatically minimize we bound footprints under the protein and so up until this point this is looking exactly like a chip seek work though might look but in a chip seek work flow you would then use an antibody to pull out all of the protein DNA complexes that involve a single protein well you here instead is just a modified penile chloroform extraction so in a normal female protocol on extraction you would mix the cell lysate with phenol and you would end up with an aqueous phase that has all the DNA and the organic phase that has all the proteins in it if you do this in cross-linked cells you have protein DNA covalent complexes you end up getting an interface layer that's not present in a typical female colon extraction it's a nice thick white disc and this ends up containing the DNA protein complexes because it's amphipathic and this layer is stable enough you can isolate it you can wash it to minimize background and then you can recover the DNA from it and sequence it and compared to the input sample and again get a one-dimensional occupancy profile through the genome of we're poking down and so I'm method this method was originally called iPod it had been developed before I showed up in the lab and it gave some of what people wanted but it had a lot of problems and in particular I didn't have high enough resolution to be useful for finding transcription factor binding sites yes uh-huh so bye-bye architecture I just mean DNA's hypersensitivity is going to rely a lot on nucleosome occupancy and that's that's really a dominant part of that signaling here we don't have three zones so I'll talk a little bit more about architecture in the forty seven or 3d $0.40 in the polygon but haven't gotten that much um so the original iPod method also had a lot of contamination of the signal from RNA polymerase occupancy and it didn't have any way of identifying which protein was giving rise to each binding site in the genome it's pretty important if you want to understand what was he doing and so I wanted to develop a method that lets you solve these problems to be better resolution and get rid of the confounding effects of RNA polymerase occupancy and at least start on identifying which proteins are giving rise to pensee Peaks once you get this high resolution signal this becomes what I call iPod HR which is Inigo protein occupancy display at high resolution actually I recently switched to using a Mac and it's actually it's very annoying writing this because Mac's will automatically correct the phrase iPod to be capitalized the way Apple likes to capitalize it's a little selfish job so just to give an idea first of all before I get into what you see in general with these methods of how iPod and ipod EHR compare this is a chunk of genome showing an iPod signal versus an iPod hrc and what you see with the iPod signal there are a couple problems first of all it's fairly low resolution and second anywhere like in this region in this region these are highly transcribed regions and you see signal that's dominated by RNA polymerase occupancy and not much else and so with the iPod HR signal in comparison you get a cleaner signal that has Peaks down own transcription factor binding sites mostly and in other intergenic regions which presumably also correspond to uncharacterized transcription factor binding sites it'll help you appreciate a lot of the rest of this talk if I tell you now that even for e.coli you only have good information about where roughly 30% of the transcription factors are binding even for a lot of those we're probably missing a lot of the binding sites and this really if you think about it sort of a hydrogen atom of regulatory networks this is pretty shameful that we need to be doing a better job but I think this would explain why you do see a lot of occupancy Peaks that don't correspond to knowing transcription factor binding sites so first of all before we get into any small details if you just look at the overall characteristics of the iPod HR signal what you would like to see ideally is a signal that is enriched at known transcription factor binding sites and in general is enriched at intergenic regions which are presumably the sites of uncharacterized inscription factor binding sites for the most part and that's exactly what you see if each of the colors of wine you shift from the dashed line to the solid line this is showing our histogram of the iPod HR signals pretty different parts of the genome if you go from the dashed line to the solid line then you are going from a site with no no in transcription factor binding site to a site with a known annotated transcription factor binding site and this rightward shift that you see in both cases indicates that the occupancy is higher at the eaten own transcription factor binding sites and similarly if you ship for each line style from the red line to the black line you're going from a coating to a non-coding region again you see the rightward shift indicative of enriched occupancy at the non-coding regions as we expect so at the broad zoomed-out level this seems to be viewing well unfortunately um this also does well with identifying physiologically known physiologically relevant changes in transcription factor binding and I should add that in the process I'm going to show exactly how important the subtraction of RNA polymerase occupancy is um if you look at a loss signal before the correction for RNA polymerase occupancy um this is a known pure our binding site which should be occupied in rich media and absence and dying here should be absent in minimal media because this is where pressing expression of Piercy which is upregulated in minimal meaning now if you look at the uncorrected occupancy signal you can see a pretty strong occupancy peak in both rich and minimal media at the here are sighs this is not all right so um you can see immediately why this is if you also do an RNA polymerase chip seek experimenter you see massive occupancy here in the minimal media condition which is expected because this gene is actually on in mineral media and so what I'm going to talk about for the rest of the talk is the true iPod HR signal is a properly normalized subtraction of the RNA polymerase occupancy from the iPod signal and when you get that when you do that you get this profile which gives you as expected this strong akut occupancy of the pure our site only in rich media there are plenty of other examples of this for example here's a gene one of the most highly differentially regulated genes between rich in minimal media as Max II there are a couple of net are sites that are known to activate and that eat in minimal media and you can see this occupancy very strongly if condition specific and localized to those no net our site what gets more interesting is if you start looking at highly differentially regulated genes that don't have any transcription factor binding site upstream of them and so here a couple examples of these here spicy which is 200 fold up regulated in minimum media and what you can see in the iPod signal first of all there are no annotated transcription factor binding sites here but you see very cleanly a change in iPod HR occupancy between these conditions in particular what sure looks like a repressor binding site showing up here that we'd like to figure out what this is this is probably important in the differential regulation and similarly here's SD AC which is strongly down regulated in minimal media and here you have a couple of occupancy sites there's one that's occupied in both rich and minimal media and then one that's occupied only in the null media again this overlaps the promoter and is probably serving as a repressor and mineral media so there's a lot of room here I think now that we have these signals and that they show occupancy changes in areas where we don't have any known transcription factor binding sites to start figuring out what is the actual molecular logic that's giving rise to this differential regulation now aside from these very fine-grain details that you see some interesting effects when you zoom out a little bit and I think one of the most interesting of these are the presence of what we call a pod this stands for extended protein occupancy domain and what you see if you look throughout the genome at the iPod HR signals for the most point it's very peaky it's concentrated at these transcription factor binding sites but then there are some regions which just show a wall of occupancy and alongside that you generally see RNA polymerase occupancy driven down below background levels so these look like a very densely occupied regions of the genome that are also transcriptionally silent and in addition they have an over-representation of binding sites for several nucleoid proteins both known sites and predictive sites and so these eat pods look like they're playing a regulatory role in silencing the genes they're there and there are some popular classes of genes that are enriched in e pods but also they're probably playing an architectural role by serving as organizing centers for nucleoid protein occupant on the bacterial genome so this in general they range from about 2 KB to 10 or 20 and there's another interesting feature of these pods is that you can correlate their presence with genome confirmation capture data and this is very similar to say hi see it's giving you a measure of ocular of the interactions between different parts of the genome and so if I just take this and collapse it to one dimension and get a plot along the genome of the propensity of different parts of the genome to interact with other things so this is pretty much how central these different parts of the genome are and then I superimposed the local epod density onions they're strongly anti correlated the Spearman flow is like minus 0.3 and so this gives me an idea that not only are the new pods serving the regulatory and the structural features I was talking about before but they also appear to be topologically are not topologically they appeared to be spatially isolated from the rest of the genome in some way because they have a reduced propensity for interacting with the rest of the genome now one other quick thing and then I'll open things up to questions and this is I think the area of most active development for me right now there's that last problem of figuring out okay you get this one dimensional occupancy profile how do you figure out what transcription factor corresponds to each of these sites to really read the molecular logic and so there's a combination of approaches you can use for this uh if you look at the iPod sites that you did the peaks that you get out of this signal about a third of them correspond to some annotated site so we already know what those are probably and about another third correspond to computationally predicted sites the one of the 60 or so transcription factors that we have a good position weight matrix for and the rest of them are unassigned and we'd like to figure out how to assign those to some transcription factor that we may not even know the specificity of and so what I've been working on which actually is inferring from these occupancy profiles be a set of position weigh matrices that is most likely to give rise to this signal and so we do this with a mutual information based approach called fire that was developed in the pizzoli lab with some modifications what fire does in general it tries to identify sequence motifs where the presence of that motif it has a high mutual information with the cluster assignment of a given sequence in some scalar metric in this case we uses the scaler the iPod occupancy and then try to find position weight matrices that would give rise or that have a high mutual information with the occupancy profile and so what you get are in place of a bunch of motifs like this here is set of occupancy clusters going from low to high the yellow bins are enriched blue bins are depleted and so these are all examples of addition weight matrices inferred just in using this data nothing else that have a high enrichment of the highest bin of iPod HR arguments and if you look at these position wave matrices first of all you see that some of them show significant correlation with known ecoli position weight matrices isn't so here's just an example of this here's one of the inferno types of fire and it's superimposed with patois motif so you get a 30% or you get mattress to about 30% of known position weight matrices under any particular condition doing inference in this method and keeping in mind of course that not every transcription factor is going to active each condition and then you also get inference of a bunch of other motifs that look very a transcription factor binding site like in the sense of their symmetry and other characteristics but don't correspond to any known position way matrices so these are very likely going to correspond to some of the unknown position weight matrices for some of the unknown or uncharacterized transcription factors so there's a lot of room at this point for both development and application of this method in the future on the development side we can prove the motif inference and start doing a better job than of assigning different occupancy Peaks to motifs and eventually to different actors i'm also collaborating with the crystal out of princeton they do sort of a universe experiment and yet be protein abundance in the protein DNA complexes under different conditions for different proteins in the genome which would be a very useful extra constraint and then there's a lot of possibility for see review with molecular modeling of protein DNA complexes to look at some of these specificities and then on the application side we're working on figuring out more about the structural and regulatory effects of these new pods i was talking about and then using this method to look at the molecular logic of complex regulatory programs both in e.coli and pretty soon in other organisms also because one of the great advantages of being agnostic to the particular transcription factors that are involved you don't need to know anything about the regulatory network ahead of time to apply this method okay so uh the grand vision if you will which I was going over the floor is using a hierarchy of multi scale multidisciplinary approaches to get a quantitative understanding of regulatory networks and over time I'd like to see this drive toward first of all doing both the experimental and computational work to gather parameters and topologies for the regulatory network and eventually be able to use this the mood code cell scale models and really get predictive cell scale models of these regulatory networks to predict and design cellular so I'd like to briefly thank all the people who were involved in the different aspects of the work that I was talking about today and also mention since there are probably bioinformatics students in the audience that I am accepting location students for this term starting in January and also for the spring and summer terms I'd love to have anybody who's interested I'll drop me an email keep bread in your study d thank you very much I'm happy to take any questions what I'm using my UMich yeah that's what I gave it works yes which is which is a benefit yeah uh-huh it seems like it would be very sensitive to how the proteins react with that so I'm wondering if you've done any quantitative comparisons with the kind of readout you get from that versus chip seek data which are quantitative yes so what I mean what I am working on right now so so what I'm working on right now for a couple of different proteins is to look at precisely that what I can tell you already is that you can very clearly see by looking at the occupancy that you get of known binding sites for different transcription factors that there are a lot of proteins that behave very well in terms of coming out with this interface but there are others that don't at all and so for example I so CRP doesn't show up at all in the interface Lac repressor doesn't even cross link and aldehydes that's not going to show up so you are definitely going to miss something I'm playing with for example viola cross-linking stuff Imelda to get lack repressor um so this is not going to be a replacement with chip seek but here the advantages you get the broad survey so quickly I'm working now on giving a more quantitative understanding of exactly what those limits are it's a good question thank you yeah use this in eukaryotes because you'd really want to subtract I mean instead of doing nucleosomes which is what everybody does you'd want to subtract anything bound to histones yeah and you might be able to you know take it off on the differential sensitivity interface to adenine histones are so damn basic yeah you might be able to just do an acid expect and then you know after Michael or some digestion get yourself down to a high protein DNA which is what I do when you I'm its DNA is 1 but segment and and just extract out the histones and and have a small enough data sets you can actually ask the same sort of questions starting with small that's all that you do this I've got I have there are some yeast strains sitting sitting in my freezer right now and that's not coincidental so this is definitely on the to-do list I think it'll be fun yep yeah you guys are you guys reading my mind in so many ways actually yes I've been playing with that as well and and you can see you can see very clearly in these cross-links samples in addition to this behavior in the penal instruction you can see the shifted population if you just run it out on a gel of the protein bound DNA that's way outside the population of digested fragments that you're getting and so you can do size selections in that way and presumably if you do this and eukaryotic cells yeah you're going to get a huge nuclear zone band and you can get rid of them mm-hmm yeah uh-huh so it's this is enriched hu is enriched and yeah yeah hu is HN s is pretty much all the regular suspects in nuclear protein actually I didn't show this bail just I should have put this slide in cuz I just found it recently actually in in some of the if you process the data right you can actually identify an underlying periodic signal in the genome that has just the right spacing to bhu lok you can see and shows all the characteristics that you would expect of s I think underlying some of this other stuff you can see very clearly the hu occupancy throughout the gene and so I'm following up on that right now yeah Peter thank you for the talk is there something special that could be applied to the microbiome research well so yeah I think I think this is a great technique and what early as I like it it's a great technique for looking at this now you wouldn't want to do this in the meta-genome sense where you throw everything in simultaneously but what I think is great about this method is you can parachute in on a new regulatory network and if experience if you coli is any judge you could do this on a new microbe and come out immediately with 30% of its vision weight matrices by inference in this thing is you can figure out then you know where under relevant conditions like what are the treatment or a change that happens digestive tract you can figure out where all regulatory hotspots are and what proteins have to be responsible and then you can zoom in on only no sites you can figure out what transcription factors are important and things like that so I think there is a lot of potential I have some grants under consideration right now for doing just this to move to regulatory networks of important microorganisms that we don't know very much about and using this method and some related methods to figure out what we can very quickly ah come back here and the TV you buy like half a second so so you you're saying that you want to combine look at different scales of the virtual networks do you have any any ideas how to combine your your iPod methods with atom scale processes yeah so what I'm one of the things I'm really interested in is the synergy between what you can do with iPod which is giving you an idea of where there's stuff bound for sure and what position weight matrices roughly will represent the affinity landscapes of the different proteins running around and then at the molecular level we can look at things like by free energy perturbation calculations figure out what the binding landscape looks like for a given DNA binding protein of course we're likely to do badly with that initially so the whole separate road to take in terms of optimizing those force fields to do a good job with that which i think is gonna be something very useful to do and want to be involved in and also look at the interactions the site site interactions that you're going to get as a result of DNA binding to proteins and what I mean by that is if you look at the effects on DNA architecture of any transcription factor binding event they all Bend DNA in some way and if you look at so there's some great experiments we've got the name of the lab recently there are some great experiments showing that there's a huge effect of the binding of one transcription factor to DNA on the propensity of a different transcription factor to bind at a site that's fairly distant but within the persistence length of DNA so it appears that there are effects on being our ad and I architecture and so I think cataloging what these effects might be can be don't know if experimental and computational be a great way to understand what neat effect they have you had a question also dismissed is I mean there's people who work in bacteria to actually look at this end of the microscope you thought of collaborating with somebody oh not to try to relate that data to individuals yeah very much so and I think so you can look both at the macro and the micro scale you know like Shay lab at Harvard it's like the archetypal example of this vibe and so actually after I dig a little bit deeper on for example the HU signal that I'm seeing part of what has me so excited about that particular signal is the periodicity of it exactly matches what the Shay lab has been saying has to be the occupancy of some nucleoid protein throughout the genome and it shows the right behavior in terms of being depleted from highly transcribed genes and things like that so I think once a little more work is done it'll be great to get in touch with them because I can then give a very easy molecular assay to map all of this stuff out and I correlate to some targeted experiments you mentioned looking at non laboratory conditions or the effects of mutations in non laboratory right so going back to the adaptive effects of regulatory code evasions yeah yeah I was just wondering what what do you think or what do you anticipate would be the major differences there between the way mutations effective regulatory networks you know in laboratory conditions versus non that the correct mission yeah I think that's a really good question and there there is actually reason to think that this is the case and here's why if you just look first of all at that role mutation I was talking about it gives a 5% increase in the fitness of cells under laboratory conditions if 5% is a huge amount in the bacterial fitness world that's that's a very strong selective advantage so if this was actually beneficial that's a wild-type e.coli will be running around so what is likely is that a lot of these regulatory per day perturbations probably help you under some handful of conditions but they hurt the versatility of the cells and they hurt this ingrained regulatory network that gives the cells the right answers under so many different conditions that they're going to experience in non laboratory conditions because life is hard outside of a test tube you got a you know deal with all kinds of different as they change over time and their regulatory networks are really good at the alignment so I think it's an open question what kind of impact these impairments of the native regulatory network are going to have in non laboratory conditions I think it's very important to look at because of the potential of these mutations to do a lot in terms of especially dealing dependability cool well thank you very all very much for your attention thank you Thanks exciting and caffeinated thanks for the introduction I really appreciated [Music] [Music]
