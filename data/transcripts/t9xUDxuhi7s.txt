okay should i get started um yeah but the presenter view is showing up on this oh i can yeah i can see that too there it is um well thank you everyone for coming and uh thank you to the organizers for the invitation um i was told to introduce myself so i'm gonna do that now since we're not standing in the same room maybe you can't see my picture up in the corner of the top screen so this is me i'm kevin amesis and um i did my bachelor's of science over the focus in botany and also some organic chemistry at humboldt state university um and for those of you who don't know where that is um it's located in the beautiful coastal area of northern northern california in the heart of the coast redwoods forests and um so yeah i wasn't a biology student at all when i started but i really fell in love with biology and with fungi specifically while i was there my undergraduate training is in organismal and field biology with a real emphasis on mycology um and so when i moved to michigan i knew i wanted to study fungi but i didn't really know how to do that in the kind of context that i was interested in and i was really interested in studying fungi from like a genomic perspective um and so despite my lack of informal training computational biology or bioinformatics i really tried to sort of grow those skills on my own um while i've been here and so with this particular crowd i just want to offer up the invitation that if you want to discuss any of this more or you have any ideas about things or things i could do better than please feel free to reach out to me so um back to the talk um this talk is about a software pipeline tool that we've developed for dealing with trying to get good genomic data out of single cell sequencing libraries and specifically targeting uncultured eukaryotes or uncultured fungi in our case so outline the talk is that i'd be re i feel i would i would be unhappy with myself if i didn't at least try to give an overview of the kingdom fungi um and its predatory members which i'll get more into i'm going to talk about how single cell genomics at least how we're using it as a tool to unlock genomics and uncultured fungi and other organisms across the tree of life and then i'll talk specifically about the pipeline and how we use it to extract what we feel are good genomes from single cells and how you can be aware that you actually have good data when you do get it and then if i have time i'll talk briefly about some of the stuff that we've used this data for um and at the base of the fungal tree of life so this is a classical view of the kingdom fungi um separated into six major phyla and so this has undergone a lot of reworking over the years especially with the advent of molecular molecular data here's a more modern view um and so at the top here you have your you know charismatic at least microscopically charismatic fungi your mushrooms um some large ascomycetes as well as yeast and other things that are used as model systems um that old that branch that single branch in the last tree the zygomycota has now been split into a bunch of different lineages including two major phyla um the mucour mycoda is like your bread molds and also your and your endo hyphal excuse me your endomycorrhizae um which form associations with plants um the zopagomycota is classically thought of as well classically is a a parasitic type phylum um and so this is like animal parasites animal predators which i'll talk about shortly as well as myco parasites so it's really thought that the zopiga might go to predate sort of fungi interacting with plants at all um in the base of the tree there's some really cool stuff as swimming spores um and so those are your kitchens and blastocadium or blastoclads and then at the bottom is this really cool group um that should be highlighting um where you really start to lose like you really start to blur the lines in between animal and fungus uh this picture right here is of a an endonuclear parasite of an amoeba so this is the fungus in here growing inside the nucleus of this amoeba our fungi and what i've been studying and why we even thought to come up with this pipeline in the first place are all centered in the zoo opaque on my coda which i'll talk about more even though they can't see them with naked eye they're pretty gorgeous if you ask me and they involve um they parasites animals they predate animals and what i mean predate i mean that they capture individual organisms too and more diffuse mycelium so like one fungus can be eating catching more than one organism at time and so that's where we sort of draw the line between parasitism and predation they have a variety of ways of catching these things and i have a video to show you some of these this is a constricting ring from arthrobotras so an unlucky nematode will swim through there and actually get caught in this um fungal uh cell it's pretty wild and eventually the feeder high fee from the fungus will actually grow out from this constriction ring and grow into and digest in this case the nematode from the inside out there's also endoparasitic fungi so here's some swimming spores um and they swim and they find this is terrifying right and so they swim and they find a nematode and they will also grow in and basically digest this nematode from the inside out before going on to catch more catch more people and there's the um swimming spores coming out after nematode is long gone here's some not swimming spores so they should sit around and get stuck to the nematode as it swims by and invariably the the you know the outcome is the same so yeah nematode trapping and nematode parasitism is big in the zopagomycota and they have different ways of doing it there's specialized structures like those rings there's undifferentiated hyphae that is probably differentiated at the you know ultra-structural level but we can't see it on a regular light microscope and then also endo parasites which do most their work inside whatever they catch so here's some examples of that stuff we saw some of those in the video um so parasitism or predation nematode specifically has evolved multiple times in fungi which is pretty wild so everything highlighted in purple here is an example of nematode eating or nomatophagus fungi um zopagomyco it doesn't just capture and eat nematodes there's also lots of cool examples like here's a rotifer stuck to a fungal mycelium also amoeba are popular targets um so i'm just flashing this again to say that this is the phylum that i'm going to be talking about and that our research has been centered in and that they do all this really interesting stuff with lots of different types of protozoan and small animals this is a larger group that's been researching this you know trying to segregate out this old zygomycota and this is a big consortium that my research falls under so i want to introduce you to the fungi that you know we studied and that are sort of the impetus for designing the bioinformatic pipeline to begin with i didn't come here to you know write um this pipeline i came here to study these fungi and so you can see this amoeba parasite down here um this is a another amoeba parasite that's the spore so you don't see the mycelium but it's another trapper um stylopeggy hydra is is the one that sort of i've led the most research on and this is a nematode trapper that makes these aerial spores zophagus insidions is a road of the rotifer trapper that i showed you and here's the fungus so cryptic that the most accessible picture that you can find of it is a looks like crayola drawing of um of the hyphy and and catching that meter there so i'm going to move on now to how we're using single cell genomics which is maybe used a lot of different ways um for you know studying model systems but we use it as a way to get genome data for these fungi which you can't grow really in culture i mean you can right and so here is a picture of my one of my cultures of stylopeggy that i got a couple years ago it's quite literally soil on a plate um and so that little agar block there in the middle is a slice of a c elegans plate so that's how you deliver the nematodes to the fungus and then we watch these plates on a dissecting scope for weeks often before we start to look for our fungus that we want as well as seeing all the other fungi that are growing on there so the problem with uncultured fungi is that they're uncultured um it's really hard to grow them azenically in the lab it makes them hard to find because you have to search these plates and exceedingly hard to isolate from nature and so you know without pure culture acquisition of sufficient material to like do whole genome sequencing is nearly impossible um and so there's also probably lots of these that we don't know about because you can imagine that you might miss a lot of them by just putting soil on a plate um there's a lot of uncultured fungi and a lot of the early diverging lineages in the kingdom are uncultured um and so this makes them inaccessible and makes resolving their relatedness difficult um and they don't tend to make supported one digi one to two multi gene phylogenys so using pcr based approaches on single spores to make phylogenys is often complicated doesn't work very well the problem that's not really a problem is that they're super cool um and they have really cool biology and do really cool things so we should want to study them i've already gone over this but you know they're they have these really interesting interactions with animals and they really remain a substantial void in the kingdom like we don't know that much about them so we've embraced entirely single cell genomics as the way to study uncultured fungi in genomic contexts it requires an exceedingly small amount of input material down to is his name single spores um it minimizes contamination in one way because we're not like sequencing the entire soil plate um to try and isolate dna and we can collect individual spores but at the same time it exacerbates contamination because you saw that plate that i'm pulling you know cells from is is highly contaminated and so single cell genomics involves the non-specific amplification of dna by multiple displacement amplification a rolling circle amplification and i'll just refer that as mda from now on uh this generates uneven coverage across the genome and so when you get your reads back you have uh and you assemble them you have context that have anywhere from like you know 1x coverage all the way up to like multiple thousands of x coverage and so the assemblies aren't great to start with and uh highly fragmented unequal coverage etc and the m the multiple displacement amplification is going to exacerbate any contamination that you had in there to start with so now you have your assembly it's fragmented the coverage is all messed up and you're trying to identify what's fungal and what's not and the truth of the matter is that uncultured fungi are really underrepresented in databases so trying to identify them simply by looking for sequence homology or sequence similarities is not is easier said than done and so when applying single cell genomics to our uncultured fungi we really aim to extract draft assemblies that are as complete and contamination free as possible and then use these draft assemblies to generate hypotheses regarding the evolutionary relationships among species and for aspects about their biology lifestyle ecology etc and all of this in fungi that have really traditionally been quite you know recalcitrant and accessible in these contexts and so our essential pipeline is taking you know this plate with soil and nematodes waiting about three four weeks and starting to look for these extremely uh characteristic spores that's that's sarcasm because um because this is just an oval right on a stick um i go on dissecting scope with a dental file attached to the end of this probe here and so a dental file you're very familiar with a dental file if you've ever had a root canal that's the drill that they use um and i've actually plucked these spores off individually and put them into tubes we can verify that we at least have our fungus in the in the tube by doing pcr on these extracts um mda following that and screen libraries as best we can with pcr before we before we actually sequence them to see if there's like excessive contamination staying or sequences that you can't read and then when we find ones that are good we sequence them on you know various sequencing platforms we're on novaseq now um so yeah so that's how we've been trying to leverage single cell genomics to satisfy our needs in uncultured fungi so now i'm going to switch gears um i'm going to start talking about you know the pipeline and why it works for us and why we think it's the best way to get good genome data from uncultured single cell genomes um so i just want to flash this slide again and highlight challenges um just to remind you fragmented genomes really unequal coverage super hard to identify contigs if you go and take i don't know 10 contags and blast them against the ncbi database nine times out of ten you're going to get you know no sequence identity um and so because of the exacerbation of contamination that mda introduces into these libraries all single cell assemblies are metagenomic and they have to be filtered um there are many ways to do this taxonomy dependent is like sort of the classic like just let's blast all the context and let's figure out which ones look right um and again i said this doesn't work very well for uncultured fungi so taxonomy independent approaches instead don't rely on taxonomy and they cluster scaffolds by various sequence signatures independent of any sequence homology searches some ways to do this and the ways that i'll talk about today are the relationship between gc and coverage which works pretty well in standard sequencing libraries where coverage relationships are quite tight and it really is like an indication of how many how much of that dna was present in the sample to start with um this is not the case for single cell genomes unfortunately uh also tetramer frequencies or k-mer frequencies more generally can be used to separate out scaffolds based on um their frequency of all 256 tetramers or whatever your k-mer choice is and codon usage is a uh you know this is code on bias and so organisms over time have evolved to have specific codon usage plans and so we can try to use this to separate out context based on the cds sequences present on them un invariably um usually when you're doing this blast or some sort of sequence homology search is usually used eventually to verify you know which bin is which and which scaffold belongs to the organism you're looking for and what belongs somewhere else okay so um we sequenced these five single cell genomes and assembled them and then we went to decide okay which context go where and so i'm showing you the plot now that has the proportion of scaffolds from the original assembly so like the metagenomic assembly that are going to be included in one of three different binning approaches whether that's gc coverage whether it's cameras or whether it's codon usage and the thing that we noticed immediately is that depending on which method you use you get different results and so like in this case you know the uh codon usage gave the largest you know with the most proportion of initial scaffolds included in other cases um it didn't and the other thing i mean this one's huge right whereas the other where's the camera approach and gc coverage approach here were tiny the other thing we noticed is that it's not in every situation that one method either over or under includes contigs in the final assembly and so that's a little concerning like maybe by making this plot we could be like okay well one of these is clearly the best but we didn't see that pattern and so when we when we were going to like decide okay what do we do now we have this conflicting information we decided that maybe a consensus-based approach to doing this would be the best and so this is where i introduced you know uh squid is what we call sdg id i have a that's the logo um and so the whole idea here is to combine these multiple different lines of evidence for which contigs go where and which context belong to our target genome and then draw a consensus between those methods to get our final assembly that we then go on to do genomics etc with uh and so the basic pipelines outlined here you know we get some cells we do mda we sequence them and we assemble them um we do a couple of rounds of blasts and predicting proteins so that we have some more information with which to filter these things and then we subject them to three different binning approaches on the left is gc coverage idea where points are individual proteins on contigs and they're colored by their taxonomy and the size of the circle indicates how good of a hit that is we use rscu trees which i haven't said rstu yet but this is codon bias rscu is relative synonymous codon usage uh which is basically a measure of codon bias and can be used to formulate distance matrices for different contexts and then emergent self organizing map is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that i didn't write but that um but that clusters points based on their frequencies of these different k-mers you get three draft genomes when you're done with that and then our next step is to draw consensus and at the point of talking to you right now our consensus there is simply by majority rule i think there's some room to grow there um and then yeah so once you can filter that and you can reassemble it if you'd like or you just go forward with your final assembly um you're presumably ready for downstream analysis our goals with writing squid was to make it accessible um you know mycology is a small field and um bioinformatics is taking off there but it's still you know lagging a bit behind in some in some labs and so we wanted to be accessible we wanted to just input a metagenome that was assembled from single cell libraries and output a filtered draft we wanted to be automated and quick so you could go back and do it again you know this is not simple filtering to do and so we wanted to make it amenable to taking steps backward and changing parameters and results didn't make sense um and we wanted to wrap and combine different bending methods most of which were already pre-established um as ways to bin meta genomes but we did introduce a good amount of novel code to accomplish that automated and automated fashion and we wanted to be specifically for addressing the bioinformatics challenges that are associated with single cell genomics non-cultured eukaryotes again fragmented genomes uneven coverage and poor representation of tax and databases so i'm going to go through the different arms of our pipeline the first i'll start with here is this gc coverage relationship and so this um relationship has really been pioneered by um by others and and there's lots of tools available to do gc coverage blob plots they're called in other in other ways that are they're manually manually um filtered and so what i'm showing you now is a graph of the gc content of contigs each point is a protein um on a contagion so there's points that are on the exact same point but we've colored them by their protein best protein hit in in a custom database that we use for squid and so you can see the colors here but there is a fungal cluster there and there's some bacteria off the left as well as some metazoan on the right and so our goal is to automatically splice up this graph so that we can extract that fungal portion that purple portion and just to give you a little insight the coverage range on these contacts was from 1x coverage to over 3 000x coverage and so you can't just rely on coverage alone although it looks like we do have some clustering by coverage so what happens here is that we basically start at the mean of our target and so squid accepts the target taxa in our case here it would be fungi we can't get more specific than that because the hits don't get that specific but we move along each axis and just for a demonstration here i'm starting with the coverage axis and so we start the mean of those purple dots and we move out and so you can see on the bottom here wherever my mouse is going you can see on the bottom here that this is the same coverage mean right here as we're moving out we're accumulating in the blue line target taxa so this is fungi in our case we're also accumulating non-target taxa here in red and the way that we're going to decide to draw the line right here and right here is based on this purple line which is a trade-off value that we calculate as the proportion of the total target contigs in this map that are in this window times the difference between the target contigs in this window and the non-target contacts in this window so the most non-target we have here is from metazoa and these these bacteria up here and so we draw the end of this window basically where we maximize this purple line and we do the same exact thing on the uh on the y-axis and so we get this two-dimensional window that has automatically selected this region here now you may be asking me well okay so they're all purple already so don't you know that you can just take those that's true and we will take all the purple dots on this map but what we don't know how to take is all of the black or blue points that i've now shown you here which are all unclassified in our blast searches against our custom database so the vast majority of contigs that are in these assemblies are not classifiable to taxonomy and so we're really using this window to select those contigs and so this window selection goes in 13 different ways based on starting with gc axis first starting with coverage access first um having the window be the whole plot and that's the zeros here or having the window expand symmetrically in both directions or asymmetrically which is indicated by these two two here so two-tailed or whatever and so then based on the the population of target and blue to non-target in the window the final window then select the best window that minimizes contamination or non-target context while maximizing target contigs and so that's how you get we get our gc coverage based genome drafts and um so uh yeah there's any questions about that i'll give five seconds while i drink some water for someone to ask them so following the gc coverage base filtering we do it based on codon bias and again this is just a this rscu is just a numerical representation of codon bias um you can calculate rscu for a particular context like this and then you can um and then you can calculate a distance matrix uh based on the different rscu values that you found for each content and you can make a tree and then we annotate this again with lee with a taxonomy assignment from searches against our database and you get a codon biased tree or an rstu tree more specifically that looks something like this i've annotated eukaryote stuff in blue and bacteria in red and you can see that there is clustering there's also some some messy clades where there's you know both bacteria and eukaryotes and so um we take this tree and we have an automated algorithm that basically traverses this tree and searches for clades above a certain size that are maximizing target to non-target and so in our case for this tree that is that purple plate outline there so our whole point here is to get a high confidence fungal rscu clade that we can then input as a training set into a separate um now supervised machine learning algorithm to basically go and pick up the rest of the contigs that have similar um similar camera frequencies to that high confidence claim and so this is a i mean you know with the fragments of fragmented assemblies it's very uncommon to have all the context that are large enough to have entire proteins annotated on them and so this final step is to try and go in and get those contigs that don't have um that don't have any proteins that we can use to put in the tree because those contexts are not represented here and so in this way we can make decisions based on all the other contexts that don't have those proteins um so finally i'm going to abbreviate over this one because it's really not my creation but camera frequency bidding um by this emergent self-organizing map calculates the tetramar frequency of the occurrence of tetramer frequencies across entire contigs and windows and so you get a giant matrix with 256 columns and all your context on the other axis that has all the frequencies of these different tetramers and so you can group these scaffold windows based on similarity in this map i'll show you in a second and you can overlay the resulting topology with taxonomy data to help you decide which cluster is the one that you want and then you can actually go get it so this is a graphical user interface that is made for these sort of analyses which is originally designed for engineering applications but has since been leveraged for um this tetramer frequency based binning and so this is a map esom topology the hot colors the whites and browns here represent borders in between data and so i can annotate the points so now each point is a content window and um as you can see and as i've been trying to communicate all those white dots are unclassified contigs and so they did not have any any similar sequence in blast and so you can see here that there's a lot of unclassified stuff in fact the region the region that we want is where all that white is because this right here is a bacterial region um and so this is the only part of the pipeline that is not automated um and i don't see it being automated in the future because this is sort of the accepted way of doing it and i don't think it's that much effort but all you have to do is go circle this area and basically exclude it from the draft we're leaving the remaining draft for our eson draft assembly and so now we have three draft assemblies and the last step in the pipeline is simply um to draw a majority rule between the three separate drafts um and so yeah this is where i think maybe we have some room to grow in terms of drawing consensus using other metrics such as gene duplication um and other other things to figure out you know not all of these draft genomes are created equal in their quality um especially when it's done in automated fashion and we should have and there are good ways i think to implement a method for judging bins and then giving those poorly performing bins a reduced score essentially to trust them less when we actually draw consensus so i've shown you how it works and the i mean the burning question should be does it actually work right um so first i'm going to show you our data for those five fungi that sort of pioneered this effort and then i'll go over some mock validation that we did as well um so i already showed you part of this plot this is uh the on the y-axis is the percent of contigs from the original assembly metagenomic assembly that were included in the draft and so in green orange and purple are the bars that i showed you before what i've added is a pink bar which is the consensus genome a draft and you can see that it averages over some of the wide variation in individual binning methods and we think leads to a better final result this next graph is showing the completeness or the predicted completeness rather of those final bins including consensus and you can see in some cases um you know the consensus genomes are less complete but they have a lot less context especially in the case of zi or the zophagus rhoda for parasite predator excuse me um you can see that you know you weren't getting a whole lot of completeness by having this all these extra contains in here and you're getting more or less the same completeness with consensus and it's a lot smaller probably has a lot less extra stuff in there in some cases we even saw that our consensus increased completeness over um what the individual methods predicted and this one is an arguable case for increase so it's pretty marginal so that's how it performed with our data but with our data you know really didn't know what the right answer was you know it's like we had like genome this big from gc coverage you know that big from cameras and well consensus is somewhere in between so that sounds right but we wanted to make sure that we wanted to test squid in a way that we knew what the right answer was and so we took the saccharomyces cerevisiae uh assembly um so final chromosome level assembly and we added in three bacterial genomes we generated a mock mda library so what we did is we used a bounded brownian motion function to basically generate uneven coverage across the genome using this probability mass function and the probability mass function the point here was to give every individual base pair a probability of being selected as a start position for a mock read and we ran that a bunch of times and generated reads to get us to about 80x coverage of the metagenome and so you can see that we have recreated a good amount of variability in genome coverage here this is one contig or chromosome in the case of sac um and so when you actually go get the read numbers out of this probability after you've applied this probability mass function to selecting start positions you see that the read density um as far as start positions is concerned matches this probability mass function because they are functions of each other um to our credit we managed to turn a 20 contig metagenome assembly into a bunch of mock reads and reassemble it into over a thousand almost 2 000 contigs which is um and this is just a standard uh you know assembly with single cell parameters this is a pretty in our mind this is a pretty good way to ruin sort of the continuity of the saccharomyces genome as well as these bacterial um components that we added in and so then we subjected that mock assembly to squid and so on the left here is again the similar graph i've been showing you the percent assembly context from the total meta genome assembly that were included in the final uh filter draft and so this is not this does nothing about length here this is just a proportion of context independent of length you can see here that uh you know this green is gc coverage again the oranges the cameras and the purples the codons you can see again that we had a good amount of variation in like how complete the genome was this dotted line is the uh saccharomyces cerevisiae genome length assembly length and we were pretty pleased to see that our consensus method in squid came closest to recapitulating the 12 12 and change megabase saccharomyces genome and you can see here that we didn't exactly beat out completeness here in consensus but we got you know just close enough in our mind compared to these two other methods that predicted a little more complete genomes but in the case of this purple bar here you know at the expense of a lot more nucleotides and a lot more context so again we saw this as a success for our consensus approach so let me see what time it is um so this is i'll be quick with this but i just want to show you know after we've done all this like why are we doing this is the question um that i find myself asking me sometimes when i was coming up with this and um so i'm just going to talk to you briefly about some of the stuff that we've used this data to do and to actually you know do genomics in these uncultured fungi um so our genomes that we generated here provided the phylogeny phylogenomic data to put these five taxa from this group of animal parasitic and protozoan parasitic fungi into the fungal tree of life with um 160 you know conserved genomic loci and so this placement by individual or multi-gene phylogenys was just not possible with the support that we got and so using our data and using our pipeline we're able to put these uncultured fungi for which you really can't you can't grow them and all you can do is collect a couple spores and they've really traditionally been put in the tree of life based on morphology and other characters and so we see this as a great success that we can now take these fungi that are really hard to work with and we can do genomics on them and bring them into the modern age of um of what we're doing with all this data in our fields um we reconstructed the ancestral state of this group of animal parasitic and predatory fungi um and you know we got varying results here but we're able we're confident that this you know group of animal parasites animal predators probably evolved from a mycoparasitic or a fungus on fungus antagonist um ancestral history and so that makes sense because there's lots of mycoparasites in that phylum and so we reconstructed that this is probably the most likely ancestral state for that nutritional mode um so these fungi are uncultured and so the question always comes up well are they obligate on you know eating nematodes eating amoeba or is there some other reason why we can't grow them in culture and so what i'm showing you here is a bunch of fungi um it's not really that important what the fungi are but the boxes in here are colored based on their copies in their genomes of these of these cellular cellulose active enzymes that degrade cellulose and so lots of cellulose that you can put into plates and other complex carbohydrates to grow things on in culture and you can see that some things these colors are a little backwards but red means more and so some fungi have lots of these carbohydrate active cellulose active enzymes and so it makes sense we can grow them in culture if i zoom in on our area of this heat map where you can see zoophagus right here you can see stylopeggy right here they don't have any copies of these cellulose degrading enzymes and so perhaps their dependence on predation is because they just don't have these genes and perhaps at least in the case of these nematode and amoeba parasites and predators they are obligate on eating nematodes that's not the case for other later diverging fungi that that prey on nematodes they do it facultatively and you can grow them in culture but it seems that's not the case um for our fungi and there now i've highlighted them so i didn't actually have to read the list but i did um so what i hope that you take away from this um and i i know i spent a good amount of time talking about the beginning but i hope that you take away that fungi are diverse if you didn't already know that and they have some really cool biologies even though they're not that charismatic and well known um i want to remind you that despite our efforts a huge proportion of fungi remain uncultured and cryptic and they're difficult to study in this context of the modern genomic era single cell genomics is a way that we can do that in uncultured fungi and really uncultured fungi or uncultured organisms from across the tree of life there's tons of bacteria that run culture there's tons of other eukaryotes their own culture and so this is one way that we see forward for bringing these things into into the light so to speak single cell genomic data is dirty and really noisy but we think that our consensus-based reasoning shows promising results um squid is an automated consensus-based bidder that wraps pre-existing concepts about bidding metagenomes and in our opinion seems to do a pretty good job we continue to use it and develop it in our lab and you can find it and you can comment on it and and all sorts of stuff like that at home here um and uh you know good single cell genomes i'm using air quotes if you can't see me but they're they're genomics ready in our experience and unlock analyses that can help us understand the biology of these really cryptic organisms and you know you'll miss them in nature if you're not looking for them specifically and i think that i think that single cell genomics offers a pretty good way forward for that so with that i'd like to thank my advisor in my lab tim james here at the university of michigan and all the members of the james lab especially some people there um my bioinformatics mentor who is now at the university of colorado instead being a postdoc in our lab um some collaborators at the jgi in california university of florida and the entire zygo life team who's really you know started this project and i just fit into it i want to thank the genetics training program grant who i or with whom i was funded for two years and who helped support this research um some people here as well as all of my fellow trainees um and thank you to the department of computational medicine and bioinformatics for the invitation to give this talk and for marcy for setting it up and all the moderators and all of you for your attention i'll take any questions if there are some hey kevin here um i was wondering if you can apply uh squid to other taxa like would this be good for uncultured unculturable bacteria for example yeah yeah it certainly it certainly is and we've used it for uncultured eukaryotes um some weird like diplomatic protozoans and stuff um those are even harder in some cases because there's even less of a taxonomic signature but you could certainly use it for bacteria in fact i'm working on a project right now where we happen to find some some bacterial symbionts of our fun fungus that we just happen to accidentally sequence when we're sequencing single cells and so using the the underbridge pipeline to filter those bacterial genomes out the one weakness of squid right now is that you have to do well not the one weakness but a weakness of skin right now is that you have to do individual runs for individual targets and so it's not the best thing at separating out really really complex meta genomes it's really a single cell specific where contamination is minimal but um your coverage biases okay so if you had a mixed population you'd really have to run it twice where you're trying to identify you know bacteria in one run and then your fungus in the other yeah you would but the one benefit is that all the long running steps which are basically gene prediction and blasting those those outputs are reused so you get all the information that you need in one run and then secondary runs can use those exact same output files and i'm we're talking a matter of you know three minutes on single core okay um related question for um the second method you were describing um the i was wondering about what kind of um contag sizes you're working with you said that there are a lot of contacts that are like shorter than a single protein yeah so small um an example of style of piggy hadra which is probably our messiest assembly um we assembled it to be around twenty thousand contigs um and we had to cut it somewhere we cut it at five hundred but that got rid of of about you know twenty five thirty percent of context so wow okay these contacts like read read level context and two reads stuck together and so um yeah i think the biggest content in style of piggy is like 60 kilobases maybe wow okay that context was really helpful i i what what a hard problem oh my god yeah they're tiny and so and they're super fragmented and the coverage is all wonky so yeah okay you can imagine now how there's some contacts that don't have proteins annotated on them and so um you have to go back for them because otherwise you know you don't have a genome we we cut it yeah a thousand initially and it was like you know half the size that it should should be and we don't know the real size but we have our predicted size yeah wow okay kevin i have a question i'm quite removed from from from metagenomics but but i wonder um in in your community have people considered using single cell high c as a source of information that would allow for the scaffolding of of the output of of some short read assembler no but that's a really that's a really good idea we we haven't seen that in the literature and obviously not in our own our own research because we haven't thought about that but that said that's an interesting idea um and certainly yeah the localization uh spatially would be really good information um is that is that data easily input into assemblers or is it some special assembly algorithm that takes that uh uh well i i'm not aware of the use of single cell high c for scaffolding but in terms of just scaffolding of mammalian genomes it's it's certainly kind of it would you know run alongside with the abyss or whatever other assembler there is so i think i mean it's specialized software but it's not really that hard actually the the the the high c is quite um the high c data is quite easy to transform into links you know constrained constraints and then kind of solve the whole thing but this is not meta genomics right so this is this is a single genome and a bulk high c so obviously if you do single cell assembly plus single cell high c it will be much sparser but i think it's it's it might be an opportunity i mean that's an interesting yeah i think that's a really good idea i'd like to i like to think about that more my my one question that i have about it is is is the high c portion of it done prior to multiple displacement amplification or is it after some sort of non-specific well no you would you would have to do it separately right so you wouldn't have both on the same exact cell yeah well i guess i guess i'm just thinking like i know you know the reason that we have to do uh uh mda libraries on uh illumina is because of the chimeras that form at at greater reef length like we can't sequence these with pack bio because there'd just be a mess of chimeras and so i i guess i was just i'm not super familiar with high c and i'm curious if it's done on like the raw like tiny amounts of of chromosomal dna or if it's after some sort of amplification if that's a problem no it has to be done on the cell itself right okay oh cool yeah how about it yeah i'm like i'm only cursory aware of high c i've seen some of the really cool heat maps and stuff but thank you for the information it's good to know i think that would be a really interesting way to move forward we certainly can get lots of cells of some of the ones that are easier to like culture with air quotes um but in other cases you know you're you're actually plucking spores off of like the auger medium so it's it's sometimes like one cell but for style opaque you know to try and increase our or decrease our coverage disparity we did our single cell libraries with up to 20 cells and so in that sort of situation it seems like a single cell ic would be a usable approach are there any other questions if not then i'd like to thank kevin for talking today and i hope to see everyone next week for the last talk of the semester thanks great thank you so much everyone appreciate it
