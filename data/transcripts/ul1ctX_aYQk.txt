yeah I do see if you parse them for anyone who the first time coming to the summit it's a weekly seminar series and its biggest that I needed to talk about technology's interest researchers they might be fully developed but they also may be in the middle of development so today's speaker and if you have a side in this ing is out with a pizza hey thanks for the introduction but I'm gonna talk about our reason a project half done together with my colleague mr. Jensen and as the top phase special expression had an RC especially you dr. transcriptomics studies so here's our time for today's talk first I gonna briefly introduce some background of specially we don't a chance Tomica techniques and then some two existing methods for specially the facial expression identity action and then after now introduce our newly developed a method spark with some simulations and the real data application so recently there are various pressure in adopter and screen transcript Tomic technique has been developed to catch price gene expression pattern with specially information on tissue sections and that there are cultures done techniques are based on different things like facial change comics Eva rpm and automatic and I solve them pinger molecular for latent Institute of retardation like Murphy and a thick fish specially transcriptomics is technically developed in very underdeveloped in 2016 by a group in Sweden Italy Christ spotted our array of food among a captured primers on Strasser slide for each for each spot here condensers special power the unique to their sport and millions of individual among a culture primers the way no tissue when the chief section is attached to the Browse + slide the primers find to the among a from education cells on the first slide on from the issue and the infamous transcription start started and the relevancy here in a library contains special barcode so following the library preparation the Chancellor the mr captured Amamiya a sequencer using standard Illumina sequencing technology and without the special bar code on each generated transcript or generate assistance leads the subsequent America data back to a spot on the array or a location on the tissue so knowledge is possible to linearize any among a or combination of EA's and performed complex now informatics analysis with new special dimension the fish is another technique developed by Tyler being Coretech and to identify it actually this technique it's also developed to identify the tense yeah directory in the cells in the single cells with the special contacts preserved the to do storage trance creature our laboratories for Less interpose in secretion Rhonda to read out a temporal bar code for each transcript so for example in the first round of hybridization the among a is hybridized with fish course with purple dye and then image and then with the treatment of faux pas poverty's Street and in the second everyone the temple how to whisper bowtie and repeat the exact same process and in the soda on this issue maybe copper with right purple yellow dye and so on so as a result there will be unique temple park water for each among a therefore the among a one the temporal park all day is the yellow blue yellow and for the in monasteries of temporal park order is the and so if I count in the pathos we can get the count of the among a or the Chancellor of Egypt so there are two existing methods developer for detecting specially expressed genes first one is the chalice take this method is the best our mock point process where as a point our weapon are used to reference the special occasion for each tails and the marks on each points represent the methylation the expression levels which attests the points in apparel as a minor to identify whether the expression level of dependent on the relative distance on the relative distance between the points being analyzed and in this method a developer they consider the for summary statistics statistics panels they have a theoretical distribution so the HIV like this matter this method relies on commutation to orbit and the p-values the second measure is a special D which is test on linear mixed models this is measures a partition does the expression variation into two parts a special component and an random observation noise so it tests the expression level or awful okay also locations the weather does the expression ever Kaveri in a manner that depend on the relative locations and it should be less on this measure construct a vector equal ratio statistic and a real on chi-square distribution to orbit empty values and primal rage H if you use a minimum p-value new rule to summarize evidence across multiple special convergence you have several limitations of these two existing method first of all the data from the special use of the technique of continual per post method the transformed of the content I into normal acetate happy for now see the motor in the numerator data instead of one state can be suboptimal and which may lead these tours potential power loss taken the specialty relations a sympathetically normality and also local minimum p-value for constructing hypothesis hypothesis test therefore each a may fail to put yours calibrated has assets to that he states and on earth the chassis is built around the computer models that it harder to interpret and also it should because the passage had relies on the permutation to can the P values when the cell is now computation is terrible so we develop on which method it's one tempo so it's OC or each sample they are multiple tells or multiple spouse no matter like talking on what resembles I think most examples also sufferings of edge effects issue and also first this is right if we get a like issue section then you call the relative for location so for each spouse or each cells but if you have two samples there how do you combine this yeah yeah oh that's okay we Camaro purse new metal spark or the ticket especially expression genes and also adjusting about the limitations so top is a builder fountain or as a linear special model where why I stands for the chief fresh accounts for the ice tempo and the we assume wire follow the over dispersion of with this person or some distribution where the vendor in fact VI + XY captures the over dispersion and PIH herself is a stationary caution this process capturing the special creation pattern which is attached at classify the kernel function K and X on I stands for the the video or the random noise observation noise so robust through this model we can change it especially especially expression gene detection can be translated into testing the null hypothesis so whether that Taiwan is equal to zero as far as the socio business is a scaling factor associate with the comments on okay and we assume the gene expression pattern for is dependent on the cone okay if it's especially expressed for the power of the such test phase really depends on the rationale of the K and the hard way are the K the special kernel function match the true underlying special pattern for each genes to fold them for the caution kernel would be particularly useful to detect LG's displaying the pattern data crafting a focal area and the theoretic your radical kernel will be especially particularly useful to all those patterns like ah which are theoretical across the location space unfortunately right the true to underline this special pattern of each G is unknown so where are two and also which I can vary across different regions so to for robust identification of the special expressed genes we we consider a photo tanker knows including five Gaussian kernels and a 5 diradical kernels and those 5 caution curls ever seen the Skyrim primate Sigma okay three no it's the periodicity has to happen yes so that's a we that's why we defer the be here v is the periodicity parameter which right so some I think that sound team gonna show sound like purity copper that it's very close and some are far far away so we use this P choose how about those different patterns and the for the influence we estimated a bad hand at how under the know about is aware the tower is the equal to the arrow through the penalized kata likelihood and the for each kernel in turn we consider the response that is there and copy the T value based on our mixture has square distribution and afterwards we combine those 10 P values from and different kernels through the Cauchy combination rule that is that we transform the P values into coffee variables and then take a break at emission of them at the test aesthetic and evaluator the significance tests on the Cauchy distribution so this rule has advantage of the Commission of different occult cause it variables no matter whether they are correlated or independent they are follows approximately is follows Cauchy distribution so by using this rule we can summarize the key values into one p values without lose control for the folded habañero any questions this is did you find wait okay so yes that's a good question in our paper we just better the way to be 0.01 so it's equal equal rate for all the kernels because it's when we accept me as a paper the review also asked our site can you estimate the weights and we tried it's a really difficult of course though and it's computationally very difficult and the result is not stable and though we try a different strategy and front panel that I averaged possibly don't know whether they're jeans right particularly if some particularly shows the pattern fall close to any of those so every qu 8 would be like reasonable traction but in the future research we cannot develop a new method to estimate accurately estimate of WI so I there are not really conversing with this ok but am I correct that this method is robust if the hypotheses are dependent at point the hypotheses they mean so you have these p-values yeah it's warming then combined yes the values are from dependent hypotheses yes yes so there are multiple methods we can combine different much 40 values into one C value purged to pass our experience and we try different method we also tried the minimum key value do but this rule allows us to control for the type 1 error and the other lose either created different KP values or inflated p value so we perform the two set of simulations in the fastest to and to compare the our the performance of our method to the chesty and specialty and in this in the first estate he will utilize those special occasions directly from the most a factory port data which includes two 216 spots and each spots in that data contains like about hundred taels and the reason we're there for different patterns is the rent Oh random pattern for the null hypothesis testing and three patterns for the power analysis one is a corresponding reference the think microcell they are in the olfactory bulb and the pattern truly represents the nerves there in the olfactory bulb and fennel tree stands for the perennials earlier and in the na simulation we stimulate your one tense on the non SE genes in random pattern and for the power stimulation we similar one point C genes and nice on the non SE genes in the lettuce tree patterns so the difference problems now s e-g a difference for the scen the niceties in the intercept you here so for the SE an IC gene so we set the interval to be negative 10 and for the SDGs next with him for all those bolts and for the st jean so we set the you to be negative 9 for the pillar spots and the neck of hem all the green spots so this resistance for changing the lambda is a part of reef Oh the caparzo excellent is the expected distribution of the key values and the white sister is the observable distribution of the p-values so if if a method is like control the top arrow perfectly then we would expect the white Econoline here and you can from the post you can see that our method we are spark which is the pink lizard within the negative confidence in the wall and some some summary statistic on the fantasy produce reasonably calibrated the key values where the special D which is the purple produces the overly conservative T values and this the overly coveted this maybe you choose a ply minimum key value Lou and also because they are when they depend on the normality to get the P values but not sure if this petronas is a psych Callum parameter is the variance component so it's actually four it's a change the value should be always like greater or equal to zero so the mixture P hat square distribution Israel a sympathetic approximation why all the matter they use the exact distribution which is the mixture of s square so we think we are control of T values and so in the organic results we can see that about the cost of well specialty can now work which over the habanero so we use the FBR to compare the powers of different methods so it so from this power results we can see there's papa always the most important for master among the three and the followed by the special te and the chassis is right there's almost an all-powerful chassis in this simulation sitting so cos Jessica is also a method which is published in the natural methods so we the reviews and off like ok so if the similar settings I have every new method causes the termination model is like very close to Allah matter so we conduct conducted a second assimilation setting we should follow in the cella single simulation scheme ok we first the simulators special occasions or fix the number of sales to a random point of pattern some process so and then we again we simmer for different patterns random pattern stick pattern of spot pattern and dog gradient pattern and fold in the North emulation we similar once on jeans no st jeans in random pad and for the power simulation we simulate all windiest a jeans and the na hydranoid see jeans in the data spray patterns so for the noisy genes expression values are were just a purse strap around and has six fish data and now after the SE team for this regime which there are two patterns which are speak pattern the sauce or pattern we just put a stab at the expression values from the Kanta or low condyle of the 650 therefore the gradient pattern we first heard temple the expression values from the thick fish data and then order a pressure of those values along the excellent who created the gradient pattern and so it's the result is very consistent with the previous simulation panic Sika producer we're headed to a p-values under the now simulate the now and the under the alternative is also the most here the most powerful one among those first three method so one may ask how we similarly under the chassis co-simulation scheme but the policy are very low almost unknown so this is because the in this stimulation searching for the SE strength is right the difference between the pink parts and the queen doll so we are the for change which is this - type of houses only - with and as in there or in Journal paper jealousy is the inch we have power all work is able to detect her jeans when the assistance increased to 5 10 or 100 and under those simulations heading as post pop and a special de are always a full power cost here we already I attend a substantive power to the FGL of 0.05 0.05 varies with our or measure - for different data sets the first line is the muscle is generated from the Moscow factory power data and it's based on the special transcriptomics t15 technique following the general rule we filled out the genes that express and in less than intent of a risk false and the selected response with at least 10 total it accounts so in total we analyzed 11 solid genes measure down 216 special occasions so this is pillow cause of the a mutation and we can see that a sparkle is the result is consistent with the simulation the spot our spot produced where have you people you told us the chassis the specialty is right deflate hitter at opinion the inflated rates of the payouts so this is this inflation presumably due to the minimum key value low cost if you have like empty values and you always for Wong Jing and then you always select the minimum one so this would leader to the inflation edge of the tail and stylus is the power comparison sorcery measures so this history data is also consistent with the previous simulation purpose is the most powerful one across is the most powerful master then among these three the audience left panel is permutation yes the other panel is the actual data no it's the extra data so this is the power without you and this is the permutation we committed that there are ten times yeah oh yeah I didn't show the alternative fukiko crowds here so first we have my very high power so one would ask whether the team we detected that I truly specially expressed the revalidate hour is out in three different lines the first lines I we Illumina people they are they highlighted ten known mitral cell layer genes and those genes are enriched in the matches earlier and a spotter was able to detect H of out of ten where our specialty only detective three and some of those genes are live but it was a very clear special pattern and at her sto of fact but was able to detect her talent and your film TG special occasions and which is like 10 times more than special e and so we very did as a secondary validate how without hedgerow we collect our gene list from independent music a single song you study which is an in that study they created a list this powerful ceramic genes don't have a map genes and so intuitively this data perma genes often times shows us expression patterns because some similar gene tends to custer together and some other genes i similar genes tend to be like crossing together in the similar cells in this in this data we can see that a 50% of the SD genes identified by a spot only are in that list while only 20% of the special the estrogens the headed by specialty are in their list and the certain i we settle invalidation with either a week like off-again week right t list of priests more than 200 genes from the communism database first genes are functionally related to the mouth of a 3-part and the 27 about 20 sets of 10 genes of pressure it has a past part in their genius and only 20% of teens / asperity are in tourism so all this results by a provider supports that our method is more powerful and the result ISM and of married any questions my and Dana okay they said simulations and real data examples are showing measurements and K 2 1 K genes effectiveness slowly expressed genes or are there other contributing factors for low counts with either spatial sequencing or seek fish not sensitive this part and filtering out poorly measured genes oh so it's a problem is if I understand the crappie the property in Simone I about the filtering and I think I didn't list the results here but when this G a will achieve special spots actually Spock is more power over there it's much more power than other methods and that's actually be from so in the industry loss love rice park is there a very powerful much more powerful and in the sick fish use of simulation setting one I think the difference in the difference in the power is large right in the simulation setting key you can see that the differences and actually between the spot and especially is another arch it's because in the sick of fish data the gene expression counts are much higher than the thin the data in the spatial transcriptomics caused in the in the special comics we observe a yellow information it's not a wimpy they have inflation but they are a lot of the arrows per user seek efficient item the average count I remember is about 20 so I'm not sure if I answer the question correctly but Spock is the especially powerful when comparing to other two methods when the the expression is the low or at least a line below 10 to that number you had eleven thousand two hundred and seventy four yeah yeah I understood the question oh yeah there's 25,000 protein so why did you only end up with eleven thousand two hundred and seventy four I I'm guessing that it's that filtering step yeah yes but also do choose this technique is not that immature at that huh so the total G I think before the fear tree is only about a sixteenth on the running onion and though we do you feel about the force on jeans cause those jeans are only either only expressed in one day or location and of course it's it should make sense to like capture those jeans of course if the genes only alright showing one spot and that's part of our content behind yourself and that the concept of one or two so that's why we use this filtering step to filter the jeans I know you will see in actually used to destroy Universal filtering rules but in the psycho fishnet and amorphous data in the following you know of the gene all the genes are capital with this few chain rule thank you some examples with the Institute the hybridization results from the LM print address so the top three genes are only identified by sparkle and the bottom three genes are like marker genes highlighted in the oranges study and also highlighted in the specialty paper so we can see that the jeans i only identified by the spark also shows a real special pattern whereas i still to our mr. pizer specialty and the really fishing or encodes a protein - is a tick in express in the maxilla and promotes the tangi show - radio tell my creation Kaneesha and the PID m5 genes which is enriched in the Knopfler house it critical for the adhesion and the CM t MK q 18 which is enriching the granular soil is very important for the thing it is very important for the 10 Jessica morphogenesis and so we also from the gene set enrichment analysis and the insist pass the wire says is look negative love the Tempe various from the pathway in each analysis and the tester and here represents the p-value of cutoff of 0.05 he starts here represents a portal a okay digital and from history results we can see that the disappear this rule also shows the importance of the Pentium or ten difficulty Genesis for the colinear layer and the connect kickers connectivity and thus the adhesions for the nerve Leo's and so second data we've then there is the hip from the human breast a pencil this is also based on the special tonica's deep Authority just a good talk our biological yeah first of all publish and couldn't patients but else yeah yeah you're doing this finishing out of time yeah so why not constructions formation yeah so that's actually my next chapter yes yes but it's more I could the construction the special Connell is a little bit complex in that next question so Maurice are really asking why those ten kernels are Goshen yes your attic out of three ones why not just do a special 3d transformation now is that obvious I'll inspection after you reject now you can go back to see where the power is life right yeah yes application yes so answer to their question is cause best for you when we started this project Ares right we can the ideas from the specialty and then we've thought of like following their pre-walk like constructing those kernels and then we realize okay because of the company value combination with right you're complicated or probably not from where so we kind of think in those rare chance for your transformation stuff but this that is that is even more completely Italy stood at a deaf stage and concert when also when we stopped at the p-value for solution we don't consider the minimum hip area low and then we preserve like Cauchy combination lines and firewalls and okay why we browser using the Fourier transformation but that's that's another direction cosine this is a little bit simpler should happen if you comes back to ten basis function that country yes yeah so person see that we don't know whether that's instructions the walk right cousin no no one knows the true and aligned special pattern and with this Nishimura actually we summarized those p-values we actually don't know well which is the most powerful or most likely one so what we are focusing is trying to identify special genes special expression gene super not right well how this gene rather this gene that I particular belongs to some particular pattern maybe it maybe it's wrong but put it with a simple method like relatively simple like the fuse class all worked work on this for this problem where we're regression is regularized typically by a biplane oh I'm not quite sure about the field sur la Sol but who is putting the filter ah so you regulate how your order in the useless all the predictive variables are typically ordered in some way either in 1d or 2d and the coefficients of those variables expected to be fused co-vary yes they are in and out of the community like so in the if we use the filter are saying we should appear the predictors the location so decide if we use the filter are so then we in this state in the this presentation also state I have two dimension location so you like one predator poets and they want to predict a whole pile up would be unbearable right yeah then the regularization will come from the X&Y Craig I don't know yeah all right also not you know it's the cursor Russell have this all right oh yeah so we Sicily that is the best found telling 772 genes st-jean so we identified so you actually ran it on the team with it one one immediate question yeah although your method is more sensitive patiently hmm it still helps to be spatially dependent in your eyeball and if you just took all of the genes that are expressed in a muscle factory bald this is kind of what you might expect to see I so the question is how different is this is this spatial enrichment from the enrichment of the things that are just well expressed right yeah and the the is you should be wary of using that acronym or something where you're just doing functional enrichment because sometimes people mean something much more specific than that that has a permutation on the samples in the backend there in any matter and they sometimes mean very specifically that yeah and unfortunately sometimes people just need function limit so just be careful with that acronym we actually use no using the profile right so just call it function one yeah very useful okay yeah again that the thing you want and maybe you don't carry that much because this is but if you really wanted to know the functional enrichment you would want to compare it against the kite or against up against a background you either permute the spots or you know your type one error control is pretty good so I'm willing to believe that this isn't but is this actually a different enrichment and what you have yeah just from what so expert I think yeah I think I was a still night mislead analysis then top of this available less enrichment at home here yes well and you might get specific spatial things Jansen ethics signaling you might then more striking yeah it's something that's spatial as opposed to just present yes yes so here's the second data and in this data we analyzed of 5,000 genes measured on 250 sports and the this is also the fever clouds under the permutation and it's very consistent it's very consistent with previous real data analysis and the simulations post chassis kind of specialty produce Parker produce we're happy to achieve value and the specialty has infinity data to the tail and in this state have Jessica was able to identify 15 genes at a FDR of five exchange and special spark I hadn't divided to Angela 19 so the last panel is the H East any of the issue and the deep standings represents or such as to the potential cancer regions and so yeah yeah we live in the linear data in the only your paper that is July 14th non cancer genes and power was able to detect a lot of them how the measure of command together community tell seven hey also we we perform the similar validation analysis this time we contracted Oh once on the 100 100 genes from common data base it shows the literature database and so the genes in that in this list either tumor suppressor driver or oncogenes and we let here to the breast cancer and these cities identified by spot only are much higher than the gene identified by the specially and also we compared obtained from Sheila's life functionally related to the breast cancer and those again the potential of the gene identified by a spark only is much higher than the 10 she shed of the specialty gene identified as special a heroes also some examples the issue with the clear special pattern so HEV disparities I only identify by spark and the HP is a member of human leukocyte antigen complex you say which is the important of all the immune response and others can see the special pattern of the this gene such as a tumor associated autoimmune response and EF 1 a 1 is the encoder w Nieto for elongation factors and the 50 is the highly expressed in the cancer regions and with the moderator expression in the in the resurrection opposite that tells the hypothesis dodged his G promotes a sale migration system for most cell migration and through the influence of sweets inference on the Fed type of skeleton organizations and the e erbb2 gene there are a lot of literature supported I think this is that the number one G in the cancer main database related to the breast cancer again we perform that functional in each man enhances here oh yes matrix metalloproteinase 14 and cd4 also hard targets yes I mean this is an eye-popping slide to any cell biologist who sees it yeah job by the way and I realize this but you know make yourself some notes so that when you give this talk in front of molecular biology yeah there it's your you are able to to this is indeed yeah okay it's all about these two genes mmm induced the cd44 cleave is thing is associated with also associate with the tail migration and HR also facilitated tumor metastasis how to add cd44 is one of the most important stem cell markers in breast cancer this is breast cancer right yes right is that so there's spotty expression of it in the tumor is actually very very relevant for biologists because they expect themselves to be far in between and not not every pendant expressed so it's also very very good ain't be interesting to look at what's a suit like within those spots yeah maybe there are other markers people don't know about but you are now in the position to like them yeah course so the reason I did that this didn't say that because this means that we added our methods and not others and in our paper we need to like 20 additional genes for example so for the so you would set your the maximum Jing said 80 yeah why there are among the 5000 rings and no tricky with multicellular organism so if this is a link back to the previous attempts comment so actually this this a function of enrichment not C so we only focus on to hunt ninety genius we identified so that's why I as the Izone I Maxima is eighty rather than the facts Auto five solid that kind of label interactive and before people say that sighs me yeah oh geez okay number the country scratch facially oh okay so was it okay so such instead an RC thirteen societies the remember as I introduce each thousand a represents a potent and toll in the gene subsidized the number of genes in are related to their potent now yeah yes prepare for the module testing so data says we exam de is from the master hypothalamus data and this is dispersed on the merge technique and they in this data says there are 160 genes measure down about the facts on single cells and 150 genes are either Marcus autistic 150 G's have markers or functional related to have a thermos and a 15-hour printer controls so we do show the cometary results for the specialty vehicle for the chassis also disassembled size and I think one gene for this data set text using turcica takes 48 hours and so because this gene has native control so we compare power based on the number of because the blanket genes present you use the positives cover rate and here again we show the stoppage the most powerful among the three and here are some examples with the major share classes and the representing their mapa genes like JT why is the Philippines for the inhibitory neuron and then before is the term African for the Metro Oregon danger sites and the last year said we then there is also cheaper chemist data and this is system data is a use of the thick fish technique and we feel how to the tails outside of the Red Square to attach gesture the border architects and so in total we analyzed 250 genes measure the only one 130 single cells and from the permutation we can see - stop energetic aware help produced where calibrate are on arrows and  it also again the most powerful among these three and because it's a 5/10 FDR park can identify 70 G's and specially identify 1100 those 11 overlap that we spark and first you can identify the four G's these three with only one overlap Teresa's previous to method so we can see that as a fresh pattern I did for the cheese se genes identified by our spark or coyote to clear patterns but as a public preaching only identified by his chair 16 size the expression is the universe to expression of those genes uniformly in all the cell's Hey so in summary with developer tweeted health especially differentially expressed genes in special is all sturgeon spent on studies and spark produces calibrate here if Marrero can chose and is substantially more powerful than this measure and this package is available on our web lab test website and the preprint is a very bond of RF and it will appear in each measure so any questions do you say my imputing yes then I think before me to write this example for me to the imputations and this is the pattern with the be smooth right if we use information from the chest then other change but yeah ok so always we don't know so we don't know the before the Narciso we don't know that Bastian show the similar expression pattern only when we identified oh you have seen like once we identify the we can meet you the further tenuously right okay then that show the be right if we choose the in petition one problem is the white we need to do the invitation cause can actually knows the other information in this defense and with the new develop I think although you and my person thing goes second thing there isn't no oh just a terrible inflation problem solution because it is essentially all genes are downsample yes how about that and is this actually in more fish technique the average expression comes is the one solid yeah it's just a further special transcriptomics techniques this also the expression where you are Lobel for the letter Q consists image based method and the cons are actually a traditional right side of at least 2000 and up to ones on actions can be a stoplight
