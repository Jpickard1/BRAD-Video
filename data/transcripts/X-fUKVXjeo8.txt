seminar with the title novel approaches in quantitative and structural proteomics for clinical research and diagnostics give it over to you Thank You Kiki can you hear me was it on thank you for the introduction and thank you for the nice day make me work the whole day I thought it's like really relaxing I don't know where the point is yeah and yeah before I start I want to talk today about two aspects in poyo mix quantitative proteomics which is right now pretty hot and as well what I think it's the next big thing in proteomics structured proteomics and I also think that we can use the two areas of proteomics for clinical research and as well at kosuna later into Diagnostics but before I start I ought to give you a short impression about where I'm from and we'll introduce it like I'm from Victoria Vancouver Island which is in British Columbia and this heart looks like and even this is how it looks like actually right now there's no snow that's but it's it's very green because we have the Pacific rainforest so lots of rain and also like here actually we took this photo like doing the spring break and what you can see it's still very green and also like no cars here on the parking lot because after three to four a month of rain and the week where you have like a few days off like everyone is leaving the island and goes somewhere to Florida California and see the Sun Tom it's not a cold but a lot of rain so we are genome Canada funded Science and Technology Innovation Center there are right now only five centers which are funded budget on Canada the three in genomics and then i'm McGillis one then in Toronto and Vancouver and one in proteomics this is in Victoria and one in metabolomics which is half in Victoria and other half is in Edmonton so Assam genome science acknowledge Innovation Centre we obligated to provide services polymyxin area shown over here we are engaged in research collaboration this Canadian academic intern actually academic and more and more as well as industry enter we have a strong focus on technology development and today I I think they'll want to talk about quantity podium and superhuman so I want to start with quantitative proteomics and we did actually we do this for for quite a long time when I came over in 2006 I was quite excited about that my own technology and at the beginning as as usual if you have like an a crazy idea or people that are laughs at you but it wasn't a stupid idea like we really were pushing the mmm technology and in 2012 December 2012 and of 2012 nature method called this approach as method of the year I was fast was like yeah what good and what exactly is this is the targeted approach of this multi reaction monitoring so I made this this figure when I gave a presentation in front of MDS that took me a whole day like it was always too complicated to complicate back and so this is the final product motor action monitoring is something orders actually not new at all it's like around like four decades and in the pharmaceutical industry that's being used for qualifying drugs and now we can use this for quantifying proteins but actually we are not animals important parts of analyzing peptides which should make as you know by pyrolysis and now beginning we separate some kind of like a pre fractionators through liquid chromatography which online coupled through the mass spectrometer on the mass spectrometer and most of the cases it could quadrupole a yeah we cut a port in a row and so the the peptides coming in most of the cases like ionized by electro spray and going into things behalf like if you analyze very complex mixtures like the blood volume the proteins in and cell lysate and so on it's a very complicated mixture so you never have like a really based on separation of peptide so they're coming a bunch of them coming in like this and the first quadrupole acts as like a mass filter on it so like we know exactly at this time this peptide is coming into the mass spectrometer and the adjusting the voltage that only I think this path that is going through the second quarter pole shown over here and then hit some gas molecule falls apart axis and the third quadrupole excited as well as a mass filter then only the fragment certain fragment finally goes detector gives us an ion chromatograph as shown over here and what I said it's nothing nothing really new it's well established this this method in the small molecule connotation area and the budget has like extreme like advantages particular it is pretty much the most sensitive ms approach we have right now and selectivity is in minimizing clinical sample so in general like biological samples a very critical point so and we really advocate for the use of internal standards because internal standards they have several advantages - some has really improving the specificity if you're using internal standards I just mentioned that what the detector is finally giving us is an iron chromatogram so not in MSM a spectrum I income adhigam it means like these this fragment is coming out either 29 minutes or 30 minutes we don't know get back to two peaks here but if you're using internal of standard which is the peptide the same peptide will be agonizing at the same chemical structure at the same sequence however is as a topic hold it the insect is a little bit higher in mass it's always the same old trick when you're using mass spectrometry you're using as a topical I the topic hold it our neighborhood molecules and we are using n 15 or c-13 isotopes and the reason is because they have no effect on the retention time so they need to come up at the same time as endogenous patterns coming off so then it's quite easy like the blue one is our endogenous peptide and the red one is our standard peptide and I need to come at the same time though this one is really what they're looking for this is what we measure and also you can see that peak shape needs to be pretty much the same as what we have for from endogenous peptide and another advantage and this was really a big breakthrough like in poly omics is then we use the these suspect arts you improve your possibility and we did this experiment where we analyzed 45 plasma proteins and we analyzed it 12 times and if you do this only we don't have any internal standard you're getting perceptively on average between 25 and 30 percent this is absolutely not acceptable for the FDA however if you use internal standard then you're pushing the percentage more like in the 4 to 6 percent range are shown over here and then you not only giving the the interim estimates a koala that means like for all of these 4500 teams be adding the peptides the interest and about the same amount if you do it like a more sophisticated way it means he balances out if you'd like one analyst a blooming at the concentration of 40 milli comes from mill compared to something what is like in nano goes under you giving you're getting get more internal strength to the album then to the to quantify the protein which is at lower concentration and we call it balanced concentration spike in in to understand it and then we're really pushing the percents of e 2 2 to 4% and all of them are below 15% and this is about what FDA would like to see so really the internal standards are really quite important to improve readability another thing is like if you have internal standards the pretty bit is right and I don't want to go into too many idiots but what it really helps is like to Detective interferences chemical interferences because these ions what you're getting the ratios of these ions they need to be identical if we are looking at buffer glasses plasma the internal standard ratio from the my 5-iron from this path that over here which is like 1 2 3 4 5 this year and needs to be identical the to divide for iron which is open to to in buffer as well in plasma see like open to two and this should be identical to the endogenous which is the same 0.2 - now you can be quite certain that you don't have any interferences you never can say you have absolute pacifist E but using these molecular parameters and characteristics like the mass of the peptide the mass of the fragment the retention time and as well the ratio of these ions therefore characteristics are all orthogonal to each other we can actually say that we have a pretty good specificity over here and actually if you have like two peptides you have two peptides per protein and then that gives you that I really like the same quantitative result again like we are using peptides for quantifying proteins so but not necessarily they're giving you the same results since there is always what you need to consider is that you making the peptides by proteolysis so you cut them and sometimes the trypsin is not efficient in the same way at every t which side so what can happen is that we sometimes the cleavage is somehow blocked or hindered but it doesn't really matter it's very precise and this is really the point the mmm using internal strength of very precise methods so if you plots and the two peptides against each other they need to correlate quite there and discuss it Oh point nine five and if they are after running then then plasmas running the patient sample and if it's not it like something is not on strict on on the line then we can select this patient over here and this patient we have some some interference and this is this is quite unique to this approach that we have here and a technology which can determine patient-specific interferences and the next thing is I believe we really want to believe into the clinic what we need to have some kind of automation and you can do this entire sample preparation shown over here this can be almost done in a fully automated way using a lipid liquid handling system and then we really can analyze hundreds of samples in a day they're all not just put your mix project so far plus 3,600 plasma samples and we have done the Sun within a couple of weeks but it wouldn't be possible at all if you have to do it by hand so this really quits our throughput and also since no no pipetting mistakes are involved it'll certainly improves our reproducibility so we all like novices technology and what we think is like we can quantify disease related protein biomarkers in human plasma is one of our focuses what we have done in a couple of in the last couple of years here is the general approach how you do this starting with a plasma and then you always have the debate should I deplete the most abundant proteins or should should enrich it and and then you need to have an intern under standard you can add the protein or you can add the peptides as we are doing so first thing like we don't believe in depletion and they have shown that over and over again if you deplete you and cool you do get more vulnerabilities and your reproducibility really goes down you also have shown that when you deplete that not only depletes the most abundant abundant proteins you also deplete other proteins up to a factor of 50 so I really I really think depletion is not what we should use like I make a big point out of it like do not deplete then we we don't have internal standards reporting standards we have using peptides because I'm a chemist and I know after my chemistry I can make my standards in them making nothing wrong like 5060 standards every week then we added to to the to the tide rest the standard of onion be you constantly dissolved and then we can do either directly ops we can go straight into our L CMMS system or what we can do it like we can three fractionators and then go and from there into our LCM I'm a math system so this is what we're getting out right now if we're using our one dimension of LC ms/ms we can around like we can quantify all the kind of 50 proteins and they cover a concentration range from the milligram per no oven all the way down to like 14 nano grams per mil in this case and Jen these proteins and most of the cases are being quantified using more than one peptide and some of them even like up to up to six peptides the more the better and we want to we want to push us even further that we have like in the end that all of the proteins are qualified at least by two peptides and then when you see like the distribution are these peptides of interest like other somehow related to two diseases in a very guess like 36 of all these proteins which are in here they are somehow the later according to the literature to CVD and another 36 to cancer and so on and also like just look at at performances and performance of this approach it's pretty robust the retention time is right on the money we're not using nano flour using the normal regular flow because we have our deal was like well none of was quite good it's very sensitive but and it makes sense if we don't have a lot of material if you do a nano floor system and analyze the plasma only 14 nano leaders of plasma going onto the column but our idea was like I'll grow the nano Flores never goes into the clinic is way too complicated why not go into regular flow rates but having a bigger column adding ten times more means I consider 14 owners from the 40 nanometers every person can spare from the 40 nanometers of knock and and it makes it down entire system more robust again image then you can use a you PLC we are very sharp peaks with with six seconds and a half our peak so oops and then again like the response is three it's quite good the response of the signal is quite stable and and then the Thunderer tivity it covers six all compacted tooth and concentration range but we also can do two-dimensional what I said like a pre fractionation here we using as well HPLC the worst face but we not do this by it's a low pH by higher pH you have a couple of sections and now we can actually go in almost like my gear in this works like a hundred seventy-six peptides are in here and right now actually almost like we can be like that's older version of this right we can now do two or sixty password protein you can qualify twelve six class or pudding and be expect at the end of the year we can absolute qualify Elan 500-plus of proteins in blood so can do pluck the cortical CSF and urine this is OPP just trying to publish like in here we can qualify on like hundred sweaty proteins in CSF and we expecting to have at the end of the year like something out 250 proteins we can determine in theater but which we still I think I don't know if I mentioned just like here like our sensitivity limit with this approach is at this point in time like 2 or 50 picograms well but they're still like a lot of other proteins which are present at a lower concentration and in this regard like what we do is we use a combination of immune enrichment and mass spectrometry and we like to use Modena's since mode it's a very robust system and there are many MOLLE instruments right now present in the clinic again i grieve one we want to bring in mass spectrometry or mass spectrometric quantitative analysis of proteins into the clinic and next total sense if we're burning up SS for platforms which already present and one of this platform is it's a Boocock platform the book of bodytalk on us but the thing it's like actually the only it's only 35 kilograms you can take it home if you want to and you can plug it in only 2 o'clock that set and it has been sought a 1000 times in Europe for microbiology actually has changed the way how microbiology is being done and totally it's really disruptive technology and now we think we want to build this up on this platform as a competitor as a similar platforms from shimasu but anyway like we think like monuments is vertical monuments goes into clinic those instrumentation from Komatsu and cuca huh no like it just got lasted after a pool that I will come to the US as well so here is the scheme of our approach it is we and which the protein or the peple of our interest by using antibodies interrupter antibodies and then B incubate this is locknuts antibodies with with our sample and then we adding of course like as the same old trick the internal standard to it and then we wash it in a plate in these beads directly on the mold target we're not including before because if you need something before and it's very very low content with it it sticks sticks on the pipette tips so we're using these beat shown over here placing and directly on the more target and here are summarized advantages of this technology so we really can hear like and which of low abundant target its place a specific duty mass spec company it's very much analyzer but you have like and capture antibody and you have a catcher ugly body over here and then analyzer you have the detection antibody and detection antibody this case is so mass spectrometer and then we get like a great facility because like we can do ms/ms and really gives us the structure of Commission yes it is my petal of interest because I get I can secret it minimal sample off it would really place on the tar the beats on the target and fast results and we set a thousand words hail a Hertz laser you getting like every very few seconds you can measure samples we calculated one time like you can easily measure 5000 samples in a day with this kind of system and and it's quite inexpensive like a couple of cents for the cost and it's can be totally automated and it's quite easy to use and also we can do it no more very probably of hundred proteins in a time but something all of 1015 that should be feasible okay we actually we have built up now an essay and for the clinic and it goes into the clinic into the st. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver and the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal and this essay is for measurement denied an activity in plasma okay the plasma renin activity is a measurement for primary hypertension and this is caused by a different version of the linen and you changed an industrial system with system into over 1 billion people are suffering from hypertension and ten percent of them it's still like hundred million people that suffered from of the finally a dose tourism like in and and what what is it exactly the entry terms Imogen it's getting cleaved by running the enzyme and and it leaves off C terminus the N terminus and then released ng ten to one and this has no function but it's getting further clipped by eighth edge attending to and it does all the biology and if you have the PA then you're getting less random and the end that means like you not producing enough and returns about and but but the good thing is like if if you can detect it you can actually cure it because most of the cases it's based on on the to more excellent plant you take it off in there no file so here's our assay like that's behind activity how we determined by by this new pneumonia or short time only we have our plasma sample and then we be split off in and in for one and one example being incubated at 37 degrees and the generators and returns in one through the activity of them and our controls are nice where you ought to incubate the for an hour where you have less energy tendonman production and then you're adding with the intern on the standard side more quick is now the topic labeled and you attended one it's a cyst peptide and then after this could you place it on them more Italians but you also like you produce a calibration curve and here this just PBS papa and you add ng tangent one the natural as an assist as a constant and the natural as as a variant and then you incubate the specific antibody beats and then you place it on the mall the target after washing and what you get is these kind of Peaks for every measurement get two peaks that the peak at lower Emma will see corresponds to the ng tendon one the Dartmouth and 2001 and a couple of em of Z cap adorns higher amass you get a peak for the sis ng ten Delano we expecting a much higher concentration of energy chain the one after the incubation 37 degrees compared to four degrees so on this actually what you're measuring and this hall looks like we have like Anya our standard curve our calibration curve and then we have one measurement and actually do it in triplicate at four degrees and one at 37 degrees and what we have shown is that the slope on the standard curve this curve identica so we just need to have these these two measurements and then psycho colitis 2 to the x axis and and the difference from here to there correspond stand to the generation of edutainment 1 and these are these are the two instrument we think it's like well suitable to do this kind of work and we have yeah a liquid handling system it's small system and I can what I can do it like it can pipette 96 at the time so totally compatible with the 96 well plate and then from there I couldn't get on to the more detail and from here into this machine and how does it look like and this is what she actually can do both in the reflector boat and in linear mode these are two different modes the reflector motifs as has more higher resolution than a linear mode and but I'll be getting like that what we see is like these revolution bilities is pretty much identical if you're using so effector mode linear mode on an int card a comparison and so eat here they compare as you can see so the main question is really how does it correlate now to the SI which is currently employed in the clinic and you won't believe it but many a sides are really coming out of the 70s and they using still using radioactive material including this si for plasma renin activity which is regular USA and they're using as a topically radioactively-labeled angiotensin and now we compared these platinum activity results with our results and you can see the column that quite well and I've asked of 0.93 I'm 93 92 and effectiveness by lineae mode what is very important believe me about because the linear mode is as good as a reflector mode that means you don't have to or you can use a lower great instrument because of effector costs more money and and money is like a really an issue in the clinically chemistry lab what is different is the slope over here it's by a factor to higher and actually this is how it should be because the incubating at pH 6 not at 7 so we are two times higher in generation of when you attended one so it all fits labor and we are quite happy about adults and what I said before like this essay is going out into the clinic so before I stopped with not first part on on quantitative proteomics I want to talk a little bit about that spots as you know tribe that's what if you if you're collecting the blood samples on that spots it has many advantages which are shown over here it's less invasive sampling procedure then if someone comes with a needle and six sitting into your arm at least like for me then it also simpler in the initial posting in storage requirements and sees like people are storing that that sports just like in in a shoe box and you can store hundreds of kärpät sports in there and and this the sample volume is smaller you just need more or less a few drops of blood and and this is actually what we can be doing am I am we don't need much more and it is quite stable at winter perch as well you don't need to have the big freeze of the minus eighty and and so on and something else like very important we have to good use Maya hasn't whisk like I don't know all also the virus alert but at least like HIV and and so on like they're not stable on this line after half an hour are gone they're dead so it's quite important and actually like using dry plots for clinical analysis it's nothing really new and actually you can you can get it over the counter in Canada you can buy this when your blood spot test not for proteomics for hormones and we think it's a great idea and why not using this for for the connotation of proteins as well and then we select okay let's check it out and here like we we checked it out like for 41 high abundant two molar at minor proteins and then you select well so really of interest to to quantify these proteins he acid it like actually is like most of the proteins what you see over here is actually what the doctor is is analyzing when the doctors doing your backlog and actually for all of these coating in red this is like here these are FDA create or cooked protein assay targets in plasma so this is like how the MS looks like the iron chromatogram when you see like you have again like the blue lines and the red lines let are the internal standards and and the blue is endogenous peptide and so like look like very very easy to do and and we checked it like the sauce I was like so how do we do you to move down the spot we can punch it out shown over here or we can cut everything out and selected let's check the people's ability and you can see like an average of 8.4 year and 5.1 over they are a little better but it's very comparable the next step we need do is we need to digest and we can do this in two different ways either on paper digestion means that we have the paper be screwed in into the digestion solution are we first we lose the proteins and then we put it into the digestion solution and and again I could just look at survey possibility it's very much technical so it doesn't really matter both works so quantitation can we quantify this bag and we did a delusion and and we get linear response so it's definitely quantifiable that's a good thing the next thing is like okay let's let's see like the 41 proteins but with a capital right now what kind of concentration and can recover around like here from 10 microgram or no down to around like album you know it's like mini girls who know so around like four or something three four orders of magnitude episode we read that they can do this another question is so what are we detecting here I said as a different when you analyze so whole blood was the type at spots and then we said like actually now like we all of this is forty proteins a little more most of them be detected in both in that spot and no blood and again like the reproducibility is very similar and also like the question is okay it's very good producible but what is like the absolute amount it's this identical it's good and unique like you have a good correlation factor of 0.9 7 and the slope is nearly 1 don't we were quite happy so and we now we want to improve us not only having like 40 proteins detected from hot spots ideally a couple of hundred proteins so and then the another question is like how long can be stored and what are the best stores like on condition for proteins you know for hormones they're quite stable I was like his proteins and we can say like we had like this torch now ten days was compared to one day and not all of these proteins actually stable me we needed me to check it out but north of time that quite stable but in a 90 to 100 110 and most of these proteins in here and it doesn't really matter if it's only 7 degrees 4 degrees or minus 20 I look pretty much the same so this is pretty much what I want to send like a boat i somehow by my son believes life is gone for the quantitative proteomics so i can summarize it just like normally i'm i think what i've shown like what mmm technology is certainly suitable for qualified hundreds of proteins within my experiments very reproducible very precise not necessarily all the time accurate but very precise and oh this is also doable if he not analyzing plasma sample also like the CSF and also like blood samples presented in tight spots so like the last 10 minutes i want 15 minutes on a talk about structure proteomics what i think is the next big thing I keep podium is like and I mentioned it like when I talk today like a students at lunchtime select whether we go like in proteomics and and one of the next big thing I think structure proteomics it is for the next couple of years 10 maybe in more years we will make also that great progress and this the same as what we have done like 20 years ago when what proteomics was invented at the Siena conference and exactly 20 years ago and and then like the main focus was on protein identification and now we can have a good handle on on protein connotation next five years everyone can do it quite well and then after this we're doing more reusing ms based technologies to determine the structure of proteins and and here in fact what what we intensify and we use our structure Padang supports us we developed to analyze or to get some structure information of clear as you know the p-n phenomenon is that you have this totally native and good prion it's totally fine and all the Sun it's converts itself to something really really bad and we don't know exactly how the structure looks like the after after the conversion and then it starts to aggregate we have like this fiber structure which is in to Louisville and and it's very robust and it's a actually can burn it like it's still stable quite amazing and then we have this better oligomers it's still too low but we can use it to study by the space cytotoxic and both are very better which is what we know so what what has been done in the past like the classical structure biology approaches and an x-ray try to analyze the structure of balls that followed for the aggregate crayons and the cumulative lon but you only have limited success so far so our approach is now to use cross-linking as one of the approach for to to analyze the structure and the conformational change of the protein such of the oligomers and conformational change and we have used a bunch of different coffee cups and some of them they the vary in the space length and is very important for talking to computational scientists that we want to have like very very small cost thinkers though that that we have like more restricted constraints it is in the end of people to give the computational scientists and like they are so close together like an if they're if you say exactly they are together like this and then you have less constraints and if there are further out cell and different activities and this is all what we have done in the past so the only problem what we have here it's like oh if you what you want to do with like we want to want to convert this into we want to determine the structure of the monomer after the conversion but then it starts to aggregate and as well we want to know what the structure of the aggregates are but if you do the cross-linking we don't really know we cannot really distinguish since Cyprian is exactly the same what it isn't in car costing or in care costing and you have seen all the cousins we have used and if you put it in into the structure of the prion on the native one which is has been solved which is like here it's a structured c-terminal domain from 92 to 32 this is known and and we're getting up this mess because we cannot distinguish between intra and Intel because identical so and by what is known author is like over this hypothesis is like this better one H one better to move em is involved in the conversion I think it goes it opens up and then it leads to the aggregation dah so and we came up to we looked at this paper from John Torino 2002 and he used an 15 David quoting and mix it together with an 14 and 14 so we are case if you have seen the Korean Won is and 15 everything on it and an important language if we have now in intra crossings we have either this like to begin to greens or to blues but if we have in care causing thing between two proteins be carrying this quadruplet and so we wanna that we're seeing like a more doublet then we can use it for determine the conformational changes and if we see this kind of iron signature then we can use it to determine or get such the information of the inter subunit contacts so I'm gonna explain a little bit more detail alike and so again I could oops we have one set of and fourteen everyone and other one and fifteen everyone if you're building up now the aggregation then here's like the same starting with aggregation is a dimer we have the following possibilities we have Queen Queen or like two and fourteen clients we have one and fourteen month and 15 one and 51 and 14 and 2 and 15 so near and we because thinking then we become and then we digest and then we have like the true peptides which are then connected through the Kousaka one peptide contained three nitrogen rather than thirty knighthood sets now if you compare the same peptide over here at the ten constant tool and 15-month then we have a master of 16 because this is a number of nitrogen's so and indeed we do see this here in our spectrum here we've labeled this because think is this protein with the seal and thence crossing the EDC and here we have causing the licen has the 101 and this e 211 and he'll be seeing exactly double six importance apart and this cost would be correspond to this costing peptide one has three nitrogen and unknown six now what's wrong was three and thirteen yes now we come into an example but we have an interpreting costings you have the same possible formations the green green blue green green blue blue blue now in this case we're having for example I'll be causing any peptides one of them a six nitrogen southern accent that we're going from this formulation to that one over here then we have a shift of six Thornton because now the upper one has six nitrogen a six and fifteen India I hope you see over here from here this husband seven you should see a shift to seven and if we have blue blue and we have 13 and this is the example shown over here and here we have like in an inter costing and which was costing pick up with costing tyrosine residues structure shown over here and we have these quadruplet - like $6 per hundred seven dollars apartment and the last were 30 notes apart from and 14 labeled costings so it looks like quite complicated but actually is not really complicated just like simple mass and if it's symptomatic and put it into a software package and it fully automatic and this is what we did and we wrote our own program and which can an analysis and a complete automated way looks for for this specific signature in the mass spectrometer and analyzes and science and the ms/ms spectrum and actually it's really very helpful to have these m15 able because it helps us to assign the fragmentation as shown over here here and here we have 22 nitrogen in there and you have four nitrogen in there and this is like these tablets what we happened I'm at a mass fraction and this is a be iron 9 which is looked at over here from you today not much only a 2 this one here and at 16 dollars apart and the B 10 will be $7 apart the 1118 dollars apart b12 $19 apart P 13 21 spot it really helps us like like to assign the fragmentation but also dust like when we said like Co lines costing thing is it's the great the best thing for the structural model list since we have the highest constraint but it's very difficult to find some because normally if we're using a costing car which is isotopic coded it gives us always like this signature in here like this this coughing car has we have two derivatives one is hydrogen deuterium so we have a doublet which is a torn apart or they have take eight hydrogen or deuterium you merely see it but if it field can't cost zero means crossing as the costing has gone just initiates across England it's gone so how can you see it but if one is n 15 when and what enabled then we have it's done with so it really really helps us to define this okay not now keep to the results though we have here with the interpreting costings we we found all these causes in crayon and and this is like how it looks like and we have made actually a short movie what we think and I don't know how to start so here what the hypothesis was like that the better one H 1 and beta 2 is involved in it it opens up and then what we think like that n-terminus goes in there and this fits very well this our cost engine result is shown over here it really goes over here are these constraints with the distance constraint and now finally all of them they're fitting in to having this kind of structure but it really confirms what we got two hypothesis that this interface goes the opens up and then the n-terminus actually goes in well again like this is not it's just a model just the model so and actually this this site has been confirmed not only with cost thinking and don't have the time with other structure proteomic approaches like limited pollicis like hi Lucinda to exchange it's a very powerful method and as well as surface modifications there'll be differential neighbors like the native one versus the appear after the confirmation and all pink points down to the better one h1 h2 section and we also we have some results from the inter protein costings like how do they stack together the two crayons and we puts also into a movie shown over here so first you see again like the confirmation of each of the proteins and then the distance are now the match with all the results and now these proteins the two clients are coming together and then it is like we think it's stacked like this it's kind of a screwdriver on the top and I have a better picture this is so over here this is what we think right now what what the structure is and we collaborating with a very famous structural molecular biologist and actually this person actually come from Texas the stretcher so far so but we still have like a lot of stuff to do like this over here what they think it's all like better and cheat reagent it's not defined through our experiments so far so um think here I have a summary site yes we showed that limited proteolysis indicate increased accessibility for Pepsi I didn't show this actually hundred fifty hundred fifty-eight region in the all aluminum surface modification and also that shows that this number of residues in the better one H one better to loop is involved include accessibility HX pinpoint the same region where we have factor the action and and as well that the caustic conferences and all of you think is like they're all pin pointing down to the reinvention of this pedal on H h1 that are two loop and his all edema I only have like the unlocked knowledge meant for the structure fully almost people like that but these lights are missing but here like for the structure proteomics part mainly responsible agenda petrichenko and with chasing student and a technician and there will be shot from the university of atlanta new habit like true to confirm our models and my modeling and they'll help us like this ms partner and of course funding to non-canon do not be C pi o net Canada unfortunately anymore and created molecules and I'd like to thank you for your attention questions yes do we have questions for Krista I start here maybe this is a very interesting pop so we do this cross namely how much or whether it's possible you you put it across maybe your your your Petaluma structure with you the targeted protein of the structure yeah yes how do you will induce some conformational change oh okay yes this is always possible and this question is totally legitimate like when you when you do the causing you you might change the structure of the protein that's right but that's a reason why I'm not when you using one structural approach be using like the hcx and all of them in this case really show that this region is involved but you have so wide it is possible when you're doing some kind of coating chemistry that you're changing the structure is there any way to avoid that yeah you need to be careful like you're not you cannot over titrate like over constantly this if you for example maybe check it out with supra SS page if you want to coughing sound like a morning or two diamond and you know exactly the structures a diamond and you see it like on a nice SSH okay and adding the costing a certain kind of concentration I have not a dime Oh if it starts and like truly to aggregate then you said I corner you overdid says you're what you put too much costing right now very quick questions yeah erm movie the model you go from a very long many instances to the shooter so how he killed alone in a distance it's just just a movie just to show like what might can happen if it moves around in the antis like we don't know it's just like that this is like a way to understand is how it moves moves around and that's nothing to do with just like a few pictures but in the end the the model what we have this fits with the data that's the only thing this is a more general question relating to mr MS there's certainly clinical biochemistry clearly one of Toronto who still very much believe in eliza assays I'm a great believer in mrn is both a claim is in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility and patina bottoms of samples most can't beat you know assays what do you say to those people died out that's like the some some people are believer and like but I actually when I met quite a lot of like critic Achilles director of the clinic in the kimchi lab and most of something I want to go very home Eliza and but some of some hardcore believer and you can kind of come in itself yeah I had to listen this argument previously DRN meeting where they were discussing you know various assays that you know they were trying to develop using Mr M's and you know this particular clinical biochemistry influential just wouldn't believe it I mean that's the bottom line only has some kind of stock like allies our company so whatever like that so it's it's a but you know in the end the good singers like you you always have non-believer but in the end the science will win no matter what and him Elijah has problems with specificity and Eliza has I also like to develop in you Liza in the clinic Eliza's like forming in box but the certain ones are very well developed with well validated yeah he poppies this is the art that they're gonna give you right yeah yeah we're not there like for I don't see like that mmm bill to me replaced Eliza now son realizes are great and you can only choose sensitivity that's Oliver but what I see is like what a lot of pharma company but then what Sonique is like really access to fast development of these protein SS FDA says like no new drug without a biomarker like they need to show that the drug is working and think they can companion is called companion diagnostic and yeah and and and this this is a my ambit we can we can develop this in quite fast like was in a couple of weeks this year you sir mm the peptide we optimizing the conditions and then we show that they can detect the endogenous peptide and here we go and then I can I agree in many cases you just don't have a good antibody or well-developed yeah but yeah they're just certain people are hanging on I guess the other issue here we discussed this briefly was you know what happens the case were you looking at specific changes in like like oscillations or phosphorylations and and the the assays really need to depend upon that the real problems have develop analyzer or more the immuno answer so what we did like this with oscillation we actually went the and and this is published in the chemistry went like the opposite way we determine the fossil ation by looking at the non-fossil of the peptide before and after beef oscillation and this miss glycans he could do this as well but only you can determine what the sir was amount of like consolation but you don't know the structure structures yeah but if you know numbers PNG 8f like yeah you throw it in and then it converts a lycra and the the Anglicans converts it them and get rid of it we come what's like in 2d with the master of the one dollar i don't know it like it's tricky but with phosphorylation is that that works quite well so we we determined just a concentration of the non-fossil netted peptide and then we do it again after dephosphorylation and also new jumping and the difference is exactly the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation and we can do it with a my own thank you you reckon maybe a question stop here okay maybe I'll just ask a brief technical question I wasn't sure for your mrm how many product variants are you looking at just one in you know you're looking normally to a qualifier and one qualifier by in the end it's like you have done it over and over again and why should you look at a qualifier again yeah you do that yes in the end you know what we have you have one look like hundred times like and you using the qualifier actually only the qualifier to quantitate but so you got rid of it and the better the the less commission you have the better it is and yeah you're more multiplexing you can do all right if there are no other questions let's thank Christophe again [Applause]
