right so welcome everyone to the tools and technology seminar series most of you have been here before is it just a venue to talk about tools technologies methodologies that are being used and or of interest there's a sign in sheet going around please sign it to help justify the pizza after today's talk is a little bit different in that we have Matt Savelle ski who is actually not University of Michigan I know we usually have local people this seminar series but um Matt is joining us today and he does research on voice technology and he's actually got adjunct positions with Regis University Rochester Institute of Technology and talam University and I think I'm just gonna turn it over to that thank you I don't have a mic but it's gonna make sure that my voice resonates everyone can hear me okay yesterday's thought was a little bit different than today's want to encourage some informality I've got tons of slides I'm not gonna stop on every one I'm not gonna do no your typical sort of linear talk so as marcia 17 as matt i am a social psychologist by training has fed a lot of behavioral economics I was working in healthcare finance and went back to school to get a PhD director nice very quickly that people had a hard time understanding in boys at high redesign and Moises entire for-profit health system and learned a lot about human psychology perception influence persuasion was able to create an outcome where patients ended up signing up for payment plans so that they didn't end up in a bad debt their own cars which sustained their wellness Marcy is right I am a presenter that's probably a little different than what you're used to I am NOT in an academic home and have had junk so faculty roles so spend a lot of my time out in the market I started my company after leaving a medical school as a professor I started a podcast a long time and I think today's podcasts are kind of like you know the nineties version of what started the band and I started it because when you hang out your shingle to do work nobody knows who you are and why should they and I thought this is a ton of interesting marketing tool take 30 minutes out of a month and then I can email people who are important to matter and do really great things and they'll just talk to me and that will lead to a community and not be great what I didn't recognize is going to happen was my podcast went from 100 to 200 downloads a month to five to six thousand to more we were contacted and started at a conference basing concat podcast at Harvard Medical School which occurred this year and the next thing I know I'm doing research talking to people and writing about voice burst tools most of you've heard of it as Alexa or usual assistant and basically the work that I focus on is all in healthcare I have had some interactions with finance and they're very interested in it and your department is also really interested for a number of reasons the obvious reason to me has to do with the data that's going to become available it's just insurmountable to me and incomprehensible there's going to be multiple less than percentages that will be able to even translate by humans and we're gonna have to really incorporate some unique tools figure out what all this data is telling us we're gonna process language but there's also going to be recordings there's some really fun research I'll talk about that some people are doing at Carnegie Mellon for example I'll do some other talks about what people in the market are doing at the end of the talk towards the end of my talk I want to encourage some conversation about relevancy to your work and this give you questions amongst each other or to me and if I cannot answer them and I can probably connect you to someone who can or I can take some time and contact each other and I'll find an answer for you I'll zip through the first part first part of this talk is really just saying this is not just a one-off sort of tecna's here this is huge the markets big the fastest adoption technology in the United States since color television if you I'll show you the graph on that and overcome blow your mind the other thing I want to have as a takeaway for you is a smart speaker market and smart speaker to talk all of you are getting accustomed to by the way how many people you have an Alexa speaker home any kind dot show what about Google it's just what about sona's what about any voice enabled speaker or device in the home whatsoever cable television with a remote that you can speak into anyone I love it right kill you too no more telling on demand alone they don't explain yourself oh is that well for you all you've seen the ads right I need just ask you that question it's probably more prevalent to your day to day whether you can skate or not we've seen an ad about the Alexa or Google system right so the second takeaway is speakers are just a gateway drug okay for us to be used to using the voice of system all right Siri and your computer is a common one Alexa is the fastest most man downloadable voice assistant on the market and it's gonna outpace and you speak for sales why because there's an intangibility to it but you have a mobile phone I can download this tool for free and I can use it I can control things on my phone or my house and so there's some other takeaways I'll get to but those are the two big ones so it's a huge market it's here it's gonna go mobile so don't think about it as a device that this is the third takeaway which I won't really go into it has to do with my backing it's a psychologist which screen interfaces give us opportunity to give in but do it and then get something back there some outcome your search produced this put in the URL you get this voice I think and my theory on this it has to move beyond the sort of iterative gift a I think that's where machine learning and AI and the data analysis becomes really important because I think that people are going to use it and it has to be something more unique than just a screen interface analogs at least under unit how we'll be able to put people into a story that they sort of exist with the assistance of voice assistance so that they get information that's useful not just what they asked for in the moments or serendipitous information and also creating tools that we use and go back to over and over and over we can't really rely on will especially in healthcare to get people to go and use a voice of system and expect them to enter assistant voluntarily that helps them to eat better or drink less or take their meds or prepare for the colonoscopy that has to be sort of the next step in all this is not just the epic book screening to voice which to me is amazing there's going to be minds like ours that have to design tools that put people in sort of an emotionally integrated space with the end of this it's sort of a different conception so it can seem a little bit out there but I think if these things are going to be useful we're gonna get the data out of it we want and be able to create outcomes that really help humanity as well as create useful meaning to our lives we have to think about it in those terms I haven't written a book on that yet but what you know but that's my idea for this talk we'll get started technology is not communication I think for those that are in here that exists in a now you understand that this is just talking about what I said I was going to talk about and I'll flip through a bunch of stuff here let me start with this this was produced by a friend of mine from undergrad later or not has started his own production company's name - warts they do some hilarious advertising clips and this is titled elects up or southerners it is humorous but it all brings a lot of attention to the market on using these tools so please join Lee about two minutes you can do everything for ordering pizza the streaming music on this simple voice commands that is why we're introducing an Amazon tech note for southerners it's the same power and performance as our regular echo what built exclusively for southerners and biscuits my grocery list perfect for every southern election available with burlap and reclaimed barnwood so I live in Alabama and that was me hilarious such stereotypes about southerners that are true SNL this comedy skits on and also with aged population and they can never get Alexis name right they called her Alice or Amanda or what have you and it was really funny I think that that sentiment is not great like I think these tools are really useful not hard to use I don't have to have a skill set at this have the ability to speak yesterday when we were talking about this after my other talk there were some great questions about what if people who are deaf or mute you know what can you do with that later on in this you'll see a slide that says you can forget that visual still matter with this like I'm gonna go with like a GLAAD well kind of theme on that which is there's not just one universally just because we have voice tech doesn't it's nothing end-all for all for technology it's another great instrument that takes us to a different place but you're not going to escape from having notifications ice cream bibs or maybe even screen on a device or even on your phone and you're going to speak to it something's going to come to you you know a notification and a color even the ekor of dots the size of have yellow or red notifications accounts pin on them and say to you something's there interact with me it's sort of a props or the passive cop that means in case let's move on here why now why does it matter well to me it does a different job right it's got it it does a job that screen can't really do first anymore you can do some input so we can talk to it there are technologies now like AI and machine learning and interactivity that it can spit back things to us that really matter I spoke about that briefly to me it's a more provocative job than the screen can do I actually prefer as the technology continues to get better to interact with my voice all my lights at the house - my wife's chagrin or hooked up to hue lights through Alexa I even have it flashing and different things happened in the world ie when Alabama Crimson Tide football game and all flashes cruisin my wife was an Auburn cheerleader you can imagine how that goes but for me it's a lot of fun so anyway it does a job that other things good to do for me all right it's better than a text notification have a light flash I know how ban was winning great work twenty years five ways of disruption when we used to put in the physical URL and remember new you know I remember before search what that was like it was it was really amazing but still to think about that today's comes strange we got the search we ended up sharing stuff with social Facebook came along that was great turned out to be the worst idea of her you can delete your social media taken from you me probably a good idea to off of that and then we moved a voice and multiple voice I think sort of hard to dissociate that I think they're going to be the same much of the reasons I spoke about early on so think about voices with you all the time I think that's the real value here's a chart I told you about also here is color television here is if you look at that slope this is a smart speaker okay I mean unbelievable rise and if you look at some of these numbers smart speaker reach 55 million homes in the United States these are funding for voice tech startups starting in 2004 you can see that right revenue forecast this year forecasts 3.2 billion dollars for smart speakers I'm not even talking about like skills that you buy for example or actions on the Google market for example this is business speak through this up yesterday this is basically the the average rise of value over time okay and it's comparing other tech so it's really out in front really behind video entertainment and lighting this is the breakdown of us populations for our generations are concerned and what's really important to think about when you look at this and look at those numbers and then you look at this and look at these numbers this is smart speaker owners by age and ownership if you notice they're really similar right there's not a lot of difference between the ages and the epics for people who own this that means it's sort of like this ubiquitous adoption of this technology which would also explain what that's slope that we saw on that previous slide by how quickly this is getting adopted Amazon has had largely dominated this market everyone's heard the Amazon speaker series if you look across worldwide and you see Google making some big moves here strangely in the smart speaker market Apple it's not doing very well but if you look at the mobile market with Siri they're really the dominant ways tool even though people would argue about its quality like a bit of a conversation tool of mine here are some really interesting numbers from Google Amazon Alibaba and others excuse me um Alibaba entered this market q2 of this year they've grown 18% smart speakers already just to give you the idea and Google is really eating into amazon's market so what's going on in China right now q4 2017 - now they're really starting to take off on the smart speaker market you can continue to see that to rise in the future so there's things that people do with these smart speakers music news live streaming checking the weather history sports for me personally I like to at the end of the day cook a meal so I'll put on jazz music and then I can get recipes I have a little echo show that shows me you know how to do different techniques or how to make sauces or what-have-you I have jazz on the thing and it's a good way to wine down interestingly I'm not alone in that I mean people are using how-to instructions regularly you also see retail getting bigger and for me that is a sign that people are going to be ok even interacting from a healthcare perspective and they have okay even report better satisfaction when they buy things off of a smart speaker or a voice assistant or even interact with voice assistance for healthcare information oh here's something important to think about 46 percent of u.s. adults claimed they use their voices system on a mobile phone it's really important because of what I showed you earlier and unsurprisingly because of the iPhone market in the United States Syria is really huge with people who report using voice assistance and health care we've sort of dubbed it care assistant because the idea is ultimately that as voice tool will help me take care of yourself and answer questions about your health care um let's see again the theme of mobile phone this is a mobile thing it's witness all the time who leaves their house without their mobile phone every day if you have anybody who always has a phone with them who's looked at data on Apple and seen how many times they pick their phone up today I've been a wand nobody it's really profound how these things have kind of like creeped into our brain stem it's like part of your breathing and sleep cycle at this point so that being the case voice assistance will come that for us too this is another graph that shows the Alexa assistant being downloaded so you can download that on any platform mobile platform that it's available in pretty fast rise here this is 2017 skills most skills that amazon has available are made by third-party people prefer them you seek them out that's not that surprising how many apps on your phone are just made by Apple or just made by Angela any Monza so there's an entire intangible economy built around interface and a tool that opens up to some of your servicer or aspect for you all in the data world what's notable here what happens when I do a search with mine why boys versus my hands well I use more words and I search longer so what does that mean for data well another tool another thing to think about here is the accuracy of processing has gotten really really good too I mean it can really understand dialects I can understand multiple languages put sentences together and concepts together starting it even better with that when it comes to data voice is gonna be just humongous amounts of data to mine and grab hold of because people are going to be more freely able to kind of search and ask questions whereas I got pull my phone out or I got to go to a computer and type I can just say hey wait word of whatever tool I have blah blah blah or do the thing even if we get to a place where in your laboratories you have voice assistance to help you get through a certain research same thing the accuracy the timing of your reading an output or an outcome work making a calculation in real time becomes more accurate and your lab books become you know almost immediate those are some simple applications I can think of even in the laboratory space let's say here telemedicine what's the graffiti telemedicine in boys first tech well telemedicine uses conversational tools through a telephone and why would that be well there's convenience not everyone has Wi-Fi the United States very rural plus the world is rural so there's there's some benefit to having this is that this company here tell adat is I think the largest valued telemedicine for healthcare in the United States so they'll call patient's remind them little appointments and how you feeling and do surveys and whatnot they claim to have pretty good use you know people don't hang up on that but they were going to be moving if they haven't already using an interface like a voice assistant through the phone itself okay there's a lot of advantages so that we can go into that later you can ask you later another company out of Chicago called Amy solutions they focus a lot on conversations still anywhere as voice burst tools have that sort of built in on readily it doesn't necessarily have to be human there can be suggestions being made about how to connect ideas and when it goes to fetch data what Dana sense it's getting and then prediction of what should be asked next what should be told along with the question that's possible even if the patient doesn't ask which is quite useful you can imagine so this is the part of the talk that gets a little out there for some of y'all and I'll just go off and say that I think this is the part of when you move from screen to voice has to be something people want to use and has to be more than just giving and taking information my theory on this is it has a lot to do with creating a narrative so if you're a patient and you're the protagonist in your own story you know your history you know your family history you know what meds you're on you're on and you know what complications you might have that tool ought to do the same thing for you and instead of just asking you to do things led to your help it should also tell you other things that you're interested in like a sports score play music that you like or a book you made me interested in where news updates or relevant to your classes react Allender so that you don't ignore it so you're not fatigued that's what I mean by a narrative reader the central figure so makes sense to everybody conceptually what I'm getting at sort of now there's a little bit of black accountability but good great quote hear the truth about stories is that's all we are putting people inside their own story connects memories and important value to them and dows them to the tool down them to the tool instead of the screen by putting us into algorithms that make it hard for me not to say no we're all sort of doing that at a time here Google user Amazon user there is a interface that an algorithm everything you search for everything you look at starts to feed you information you start to end up in your own little echo world echo chamber you could argue that it's really the result of some of the polarity we're experiencing now in the United States is sort of voluntarily we've been in these little boxes we're happy to be or not being exposed to other end those other people or other things I'll keep moving on here so I work with design these tools right so what are some four big features for me if someone's interacting with a voice interface to me these are Universal features of design printer failure perception is everything have to really understand why someone what someone understands but what we're telling them it isn't believe it when you see it and see it because you believe it that's really the true nature of our minds reciprocity matters why do I use this tool once it's doing something for me and sometimes it can do something up though I mean even sort of serendipitous tools and therefore I continue to use it right so I'm giving back to it I extend my hand to dr. Boyle what is his immediate reaction or I smile and laughter usually smiles and laughs back which is great humans are you can't say no to reciprocity if your human is I can't to make sure you always design for reciprocity and we're lazy we are lazy people I mean how many of you would have come here without free lunch recited to me one guy thanks I appreciate it just kidding I'm giving you guys a hard time did you get the idea if I didn't have to get out of bed today and I can get up at the time I wanted and watch the video I wanted eat the fruit I want and maybe get started around 1:00 and have a workout before then I do that because I'm a human being and humans are naturally lazy I've got it get myself filming I have a purpose and a reason all of a sudden different psychological personas that make it easier for us than other people but voice tools really can help us get beyond that by just making the presumption early on this person this thing on the other end isn't going to do anything unless I give it some information and persuaded to do something and then habituation of behavior we can use the three other things in there and really good design create a narrative we can get to a place where people can have bitchu eight new behaviors neuroplastic theory at work and really changed their health for the better or stabilize themselves apparent chronic condition conversation designs some other things I think ways can do reduce barriers defaults you know what happens when you don't make a choice at telling you yeah hey you're signed up for an automatic vaccinations at the health center your appointments at 3:00 they might tell you that it might not say you can change it and you're a little more likely to go business does it say hey you can change the plan that's what I mean by defaults simplification make a calculation easy for you to make a process easy to understand social support I'm having a bad day and really anxious from really depressed maybe it can teach me and my buddy Peter and it says hey Peter Matt isn't feeling so good you want to talk to him yeah Peter's like hey Matt what's up for the tide is doing well and heard your talk went really well I'm good to see you again for social support with the aging that's a huge thing talking to their children talking to their friends being involved in their own communities staying active incorporate visuals I've talked about that already and then you gonna make it fun you got to make it interesting I think that's so key and it is fun it is interesting like don't make it boring anymore I mean when I do a search in Google and I have to sift through all that SEO garbage to find what I'm really looking for I remember when Google came out and there wasn't reads of influencing my search results I was like wow you know this is unbelievable decide you know there was all this but I know there was a blue tang plan name generator' that's fun or whatever there might be out there so I think for voice tools whether it's in the lab or with patients room on my clinical side make it useful make it interesting that's got to be a design feature for the future otherwise we're just wasting our time I think and really pushing this forward all right so another part of this that we'll talk about more in a minute is this is Jaron Lanier anyone heard of Jaron Lanier yeah but who is Jaron Lanier wouldn't see famous for beyond so a lot of you know public intellectuals claim that he invented and is the father of propagating virtual reality for all of us he wrote a really good book recently called ten reasons or twelve reasons into leader social media one bug but he also talks a lot about the economy of tech and how we've democratized the data we get out of it instead the value the dollar value comes from selling the data and mining the data he says this is kind of dangerous right because of what I mentioned earlier which is you end up in a situation where you're influencing consumers based on the algorithm you put them within just to move them towards different places that get them to buy or finance or make choices that really benefit a third party and not you're shaking at you agree with this right yeah you probably experienced some of them I mean how many people have done a search and then you go back to the computer later and whatever you search for the force being advertised on side like when I first started happening to me I was like oh neat and then afterwards I was like no you know I really want that to be shared you know it's kind of scary so he basically says we've got to do something over different year which is double down on being human he says the features services have to be what's valuable we have to open up the data to people like you all to find out what's going on and then that should be used by the company is to create even more valuable tools or modify what they've already created well he says that's a better way forward we'll talk about security and ethics later but there's so much more data that can be taken from me especially if I have a mobile care assistant mobile device that's on all the time recording passively conversations I have and processing that or noises adheres in the background there's some amazing technology that can tell respiration rate some people are claiming they can even tell sensor mentality and your voice you know or even one pressure by the sound your voice way they process that so a lot of healthcare data a lot of personal data you know some people want to have that discussion of early on I think it's worthwhile similar to putting cameras in mobile phones I remember early on when the mobile phone smartphone I never had a camera people were kind of put off by all the increases public pictures people were taking that you could share I don't want to be in your picture you know or I'm just walking through the background all of a sudden I'm on the Internet you know now we don't really think about that anymore but early on here think it's something everything about once more so how does this impact things I told you that people say they like the experience more I would hypothesize that because people when they search for something on Google for example claim that that's Thoreau tative and that is truth on voice you're not gonna have a choice of things that relate to you is going to be a thing and then maybe another thing suggested to you to go do so we have to really consider those things interestingly with smart speakers alone if you break it down by demographic black Americans tend to be the most interested in having a smart speaker more so than Hispanics and whites what does that mean for us as far as usability even in health care it's important things to consider especially if you're attacking certain chronic conditions or certain populations of people this is an interesting sort of look at the data this particular calculation says I don't even know anyone know this number I don't even know how you wouldn't label that I asked that on my podcast and has anyone to email me or tweet at me and I've got no responses unsurprisingly the whole idea I think for all of you that's relevant is this is just a hypothesis of like what people think who can be translated out of all the data in one day that's collected from smart speakers for voice assistance and that's the 2018 you know we're if you notice those charts are not even at like max capacity so this number is probably small so this is your world not mine on the data the storage the management the translation I hope that gets your wheels turning about possibility a use case that I think is really important EMR s are the bane of existence for a lot of providers they have a screen in front of their patient if dr. Boyle is my patient I can just be sitting with him having an organic conversation without a keyboard and a screen in front of us but with voice I'm able to speak to him have my examination my history and that can be recorded and processed and put into an EMR in queryable fields for billing security litigation risk management contraindication of pharmaceuticals and then that means at night when I go home I am NOT doing my notes that's what a lot of physicians are dealt with which to me is a huge problem because I'm tired I'm cranky when I'm tired what happens to my mind and my ability to think and make connections well my working memory capacity is a get tired get smaller and smaller I'm not processing like an optimal computer and my brain anymore and we're arguably hurting the care that we all can end up getting the other part of this is there are fewer physicians going to school there are fewer physicians still practicing so voice assistants allow us to take care of people prevent them from even coming in but getting the care they needed to carry themselves so that providing themselves is less taxed and can deal with people who really need that more online care more so than me or you they might have a fever and a runny nose and all we really need is someone to confirm it and send this to the pharmacy or the pharmacy to deliver the medication you may need or take the nap eat the matzo ball soup and drink the Gatorade and you'll be all right so the rest of this talk is going to be a little bit more interactive we've got the clock right about 20 more minutes before Kuhn am i right okay so feel free to love me ask questions during this I want you to feel comfortable like I'm not going to judge you this is such a new technology when it comes to application I do not have all the answers and if anyone out in the market says they do they're folded so we're really sort of in this like ideation phase so let's just go over a few bullets of use cases available for voice right now or what people have been saying content so there's a ton of stuff you can put in fact you pull from these interfaces and think about them as interface not just smart speakers okay they can be created for anything you want to be you could create an entire interface for example fetching info about questions you have on some reading frame of DNA that corresponds some disease structure if you put in the right data tables they can do that okay but let's think about this for provider side care because that's where I've been spending my time I think it's more relevant from you to speak that way content is your asset okay so make sure you have the right things the right tables available similar to what you would have with search although with SEO some of that stuff is kind of locked down right so thank goodness for things like Google Scholar and ebscohost and others where you can actually get through a search engine and get to information and content that's really important partnerships to leverage and core to leverage use care and implementations great that I have a tool I've got to send someone to a pharmacy or maybe connect them over the phone to a real practitioner and they need interoperability I might make an interface that doesn't connect to any diagnostic tool or any EMR or any phone that doesn't help anybody we have to really think about that and the rules we have for it beyond hl7 service navigation that can be as easy as me as a provider walking through a hospital and saying to a speaker or a device who's the attending on this floor who's the charge nurse on this floor what's the attendance on this floor if it's private enough where so it's so patient what room please direct me they're just getting that information immediately without wasting stuff okay reducing time increasing efficiencies better clinician experience better patient experience lower cost better outcomes like I've mentioned with dr. Doyle if I don't have to type in that screen while I'm actually trying to do my work I'm arguably doing better work it's probably more safer work because in the background that's telling me hey this history dictates that this person doesn't need to be given this drug or this was already done for them you can grab that image such as such a place go look at it it's really important for physicians as well as patients they feel like they're being heard that their history really matters it endowed them to the service of that organization and that provider in the attribution do you guys know that most physicians these days are choosing to be employed anyone know that the history of the private practitioner has slowly waned and being employed is preferential so if I'm an organization like Michigan and I want to get a really awesome physician to come practice as an employee I can say weekend nights and weekends probably open because we have a voice enabled tool and we also have safer outcomes because of this tool and so you're less likely to make a mess which for you means your history as the clinician is better and stronger would you want to come here to the place that doesn't have that well it's pretty easy same with patient attribution what we'll notice in a little while are there few tools out there Cigna being one Boston Children's as another that's notable where parents work patients can say I've got this issue and I'm curious about this thing and it can return to them hey here's a clinician close by dermatologist you can go see you me that you worry about and since you're connected through your profile what we've made the appointment for you so a clock looks like it's open are you okay with that yes so if you don't have that in a market compared to your competitor all of a sudden in the volume and the access starts to wane for people who aren't using those tools so you're getting an idea hCAP stores is another thing are you all familiar with sort of the true value of the America the AMA living it legislation of moving from making money from volume to making money for quality of care so the anime Obamacare basically created a really interesting format which said if you don't have great quality care and here are the metrics for measuring one of them is satisfaction another is readmission meaning first we got care but they came back to your hospital as an invasion then we're gonna dock you pay we're gonna take two three four percent off your reimbursement from the federal government because you're not offering good quality care well if I can have a voice of system with you in inpatient doctor bed and when you leave its with you at home then all of a sudden your satisfaction for care your understanding of your care the the likelihood of exacerbation and readmission goes really far down and my risk or lower readmissions as a penalty from the federal government goes closer to zero ideally so here's some basic use cases that people are thinking of right now this is early okay it's not even going to be where we end up saying is notable and fantastic but this is their early stuff the population the United States population of large countries across the world as an aging state folks that are older loved these tools believe it or not if you look at the adoption rate for smart speakers it's really no different from people from 25 to 35 if you look over the age of 55 it's the same adoption so they're open and able and willing to use they love for communication and engagement with each other right so maybe they're retired or they're not working anymore they can engage their community their loved ones other people who are in their community or older or at home and it can be done seamlessly easily safety and security of over accompanying in the net called like pot like pot is everyone remember the commercials gone I can't get up yeah Peters smirking but there was sort of this meeting going on before we knew they were called memes where you would kind of like yell that out if you fell down at a baseball game or something but there's an Alexa based tool like this now that is profound and has so many more features the claim in that even is it can distinguish me dropping this on the floor versus my body hitting the floor and it can alert immediately a family member or emergency services whether I call out or not now that is profound and that is balanced and that for someone who might have mobility issues or get dizzy alatar has early onset dementia or just dimension general could be a lifesaver for them and also prevent some heartbreak for family that's close by because it can alert family for text messages as well general health and wellness get the mountain about give them puzzles to do remind them of medications that they have comorbidities diet restriction even suggest recipe lists and purchasing list with a grocery education and contribution to their own communities psychologically when we get older a lot of us want to give back start to think to ourselves what kind of offer the world before it gone these tools allow a way to do them this is interesting this company has okay so let me to start the section by saying you all know about Alexa and you guys all know about Google but you may not know that there are other platforms out there right and these all have different features they have different ways of being designed they have incorporations of AI or machine learning in different capacities and they're sort of in the market I'm floating out there looking for use cases and some are probably better fit for others Robin Labs is one of them they have a tool for building voice assistants and care assistants that has some sort of predictor built into it it can be taught new phrases and concepts so for example on the southerner there are colloquialisms spoken everyday where a lot of you've not spent time there you may not know this was a real way to communicate people ostensibly these things might be able to pick up on that and also give me feed them but it can also pick up on other habits and other things going on at home they give some tangibility and contextualization that means that the patient is less likely not to use it and more likely to engage with it and maybe the information through these tools that get fed back into an EMR is more useful not just more information and that's going to be a problem I think because you can get a ton of information but if I'm a physician or a nurse or anybody that's working in healthcare I don't have as much time anyway because there's less of them and so now I have to go here and sift through all that stuff now back into these tools if they're bill appropriately should be able to give me useful information not just more encouraged to making connections for me simplifying the process keeping people healthier and safer Robyn lab says it really we will contact where I would if I were you look into them they've got a bunch of great white papers interesting things going on their orbit out in the living man started the slide and Alex you've heard of this yesterday I started the slide and I named it orbit in the dying man than that but it's a little bit macabre and probably antithetical to what the story I'm about today is so we're gonna focuses on voice tool applications in healthcare they're run by a guy named Nature Laurie is really fascinating guy they're out of Boston they were doing some work with a palliative care and home health agency for end-of-life use cases for voice first okay and so they were thinking themselves clinically like what can we provide produce for pain management comfort for the providers or the patient's themselves so they came up with a bunch of different ideas and prototypes I don't know if it was Nate or somebody else had the right idea and I don't I say that with some sarcasm let's bring in someone who has a terminal illness and ask them like okay first of all that is the best idea probably should have been idea number one when you're building means tool second of all there's a famous company all of us very early who did something similar by putting designers and encoders programmers in the same room that was Apple I said all right people who think differently than other people people that focus on function and people that functional form what would you make if you made the perfect tool that analog was useful orbit up so they brought in one particular patient who had a terminal illness and they said look at what we got here isn't this great these really complex things and can be done largely without an interface for a screen and can really help your process and make you comfortable and they said what do you think and he said none of that matters and so they were kind of like gasps and he said you don't really matters to me not this stuff that the clinicians worry about I expect you guys to me that kind of work I expect them to offer me the right kind of a meds and the nutrition management I need what scares me and what I want is I don't want to be alone when I die that's what freaks me out not all this other stuff you can give me morphine and opioids and those things work we know it but I don't want to be by myself I die and my friends and family that know that I'm dying they have children they have jobs and they're in an animal and so they disasters it what you want what would work for you and he said it well I just I want a playlist that I can hear songs that matter to me that remind me of memories and people that I've loved or times they've gone by they could give me comfort and I want to be able to yell it out anywhere that I am if I can't move or if I'm by myself and I'm alone and I can listen to this music while I pass away so Nate told us this story at the conference about 65 days ago and it was mean it's just a simple story but it's really tangible right because we all know that we're born one day we won't be here or a horrible feeling to think that you might die by yourself I don't were sawed on anybody and so that's what they did they just created a wake word for them that automatically start playing playlist whenever he wanted and he curated the songs while he was able to have that going and I think if I'm right about a story that they might have just played that place anyway while they're with him but that was really get going with or without commercials Oh without would be a bad omen I'm hearing a beautiful symphony all the sudden it's like hey have you tried Alexia so good question but I think for this particular case the example is some of this stuff early on can be simple and it can be far-reaching with that simplicity and I think for all of you who are students who might be thinking wow this is really complex technology and can do all this stuff don't think too far detail just go scratch scratch the surface first that's really the early place this really can be useful for all of us I love that story I heard you share with other people orbit us the name of that company there's a similar company that works only with the disabled they're based out of Toronto I'm going to be doing some work with them as you can imagine the tools that you can create for people who are in mobile to feed themselves or open doors answer phones and things are fantastic with voice and there are a lot of really great early unique customized cases have been built for people who are in that state and the biggest love why not right business is freedom this is like pot I talked about that a second ago so it's basically like a an echo speaker the seniors who own it can talk so their friends and the caregivers there's also prompts and alerts and reminders so using sort of layered information and visuals you know it can be a verbal looking via text report back how you feeling I think that's also early on the idea of sending you a prompt and giving it back to me I think is probably something that we should move away from eventually the tech I think will get to a place to do that and I can tell you why there is technology at CMU at Carnegie Mellon right now where they can use the far-field mics in an echo dot by the way there are seven and the average amount of mics now in a home that even has one of those is 50 as a function of that multiple all your mind they can tell how many litres of fluid leave the sewage pipes every day if you have a refrigerator is running you can tell you the model and the model here it can tell you how many toilets flush and where they question the house it can tell you if it's urine or water being poured down the toilet the density of that fluid the amount of that fluid it can probably even tell the difference between opening a bag of chips and the opening of a pill bottle and that's the example that I would like to give you that it doesn't have to prompt me it can hear me now that yeah Marcy is like I don't like that much yeah a lot of people feel a little iffy about it but I think that consumers have told us regularly and chose convenience over privacy and we always remove done not this guy is that what's your name sure you're not telling me but I think I think we all really have a compound use this idea you can't get you're being recorded that everything you do is being watched just forget it so right here day to day I think for some people who are managing multiple comorbidities maybe they having trouble with that probably good well I know maybe I would knowing myself anyway I love the concept I think that the iterative stuff will go to the wayside as technology continues to be adopted from the research that's being done out there really exciting stuff right nuance there another company that incorporates an AI and the conversational tools they would be sort of a step to the side really like tell a doc but they're really focused less on health care they do have some healthcare applications they're more about that making appointments and scheduling and they have planned to say that they have some interest in building clinic side tools for the note-taking that I mentioned to you and they do some cognitive prediction similarly to what I mentioned where instead of just one give and get it's a give and a series of questions or data that's given back to them they have some interesting stats some real business speaking down there but basically what they're saying is they reduce missed appointments and they have resolved initial phone calls 81% of time you so as we are as you already talked about when you do a Google search you have done sort through all the SEO crap yeah right you do a youtube search of anything you have to watch or skip a bunch of paths yeah I know same thing applies to Spotify and everything else that you do forcing you to pay sooner or later advertisers will get into whatever of whatever environment they can turn influence consumers sure what prevents them from getting into an Alexa system or getting into any of these boys first well for a Alexa in fact it will probably end up being encouraged and you bring up a great point and it's right on time because I'm going to talk about platforms that don't give data away and our enterprise specific and what I'll say later I'm glad you're going that direction because I think platforms that say to businesses or people we can build a tool and the data isn't anyone else's but yours and you can keep it safe on a private server a privacy that you choose and then on your work through well for Facebook lately I'm sorry so that's work real well from Facebook and a lot of other places I mean whatever recent sort of hacking yes yeah I think that's always going to be a risk for us most definitely but I I think that if I was choosing to build a tool that was built for consumers and advertisers versus 12:04 just my company alone with a little bit more of a guarantee of that privacy and security I probably go the latter there is a company called sound town they're going by hounded by now it's one of those tools you can download on your own I suggest you try it out they are doing some work with autonomous vehicles where they are putting these into cars in fact Hyundai already uses their tool for one of their tools and they're developing others with them to incorporate some AI and some prediction into that which ultimately will lead to what voice control while you're not even driving your car I mean that's going to be a really important thing and that's where they're headed and there's important implications of that another company called pull-string that I really like is built by former Pixar executives and you might not be surprised why I like them because of my narrative sort of thought where we go with these they love the idea of narratives so much so that they put their tool in a Barbie and there's some great data from this that I think is suitable for healthcare or any other use case and it has lots to do with lapse abuse activation abuse and how long you choose to use it this particular research was done on your guests at children and when they came out with the Telo Barbie they tested it on kids you know they had research group doing it and the average amount of time mean that a child played with this doll consecutively was two hours if you have children who've been around children it's remarkable to think about and because of the tool they set up where the kids could ask a questions and it could ask back and just like a normal nonlinear conversation we have with people that you like hanging out with the kids loved it the longest time that a child played with it was six hours consecutively and the researcher had to walk into the room and tape it all and say times up here's the juice this is getting to the level of lumineers so either stop playing with this toy but the point I'm trying to make here these things are absolutely like just captivating for children and they are for adults too when you're right with a really nice contextually sort of advanced conversation tool it's like speaking to a friend or like a smart person you really respect who has interesting things to say and relevant to you you do want to interact with holstering is not going anywhere I think the egg will end up being a name you hear a lot and I encourage you to go to their website check out the white papers and take a look I think my health care they're very applicable this is the see you later this is the Boston Children's Group this gives a little bit of a map what they're doing essentially parents can say I'm worried about fever and they can connect them to a real person and that person can end up making appointments for them and getting them into their system and the Boston market for Pediatrics that has been a huge win for them and they're going to be iterating on this tool farther farther we move on here because we're gonna run out of time yesterday was brought up about doing just that by the healthcare tool and it's AI dependent context dependent what are our risks what if I give someone the wrong detail to take care of themselves totally misdiagnosed or misses symptom someone's got a peripheral end of situs and I tell them take off itself sir and the end up rupturing and getting really sick and sets of sometime well that's not first of all that's not good for litigation second law is just not good like you want to do that to somebody I don't want to hurt you I want to help you I think that those are questions that need to be asked also does the FDA consider the seek advice you know I've seen some things that says that there's an argument argument over that like is it a platformer is it a device what kind of information if I'm exchanging it's considered you know influential clinical advice to somebody I mean and indeed what's that there's a website I'm blanking what's the popular yeah where them did WebMD gives out information no one batted an eye when it came out with that website and we all know I think that people tend to think that anything they get off the screen tends to be authoritative the same is going to be true with these devices except I'm not gonna have comparisons right I'm gonna be told one thing we're given a piece of advice or recommendation and I'm not gonna say scratch my head and say only ask that different way probably to go all right so it's something for us to consider in the design specially healthcare and if you're using these in research applications may be the same you know maybe you're using it with some sort of statistical program and it doesn't recognize a type 1 or type 2 error that's really important and the next thing you know you're basically working off of an error the rest of the way you're wasting time money security we brought that up I think the problems they are probably the same that they are now except that we have people that come to our homes or that might be around us having conversations and my voice is system on my phone picks up on it and processes it how is that different than taking a picture of Marcy walking behind me when I'm in front of the big house maybe she doesn't want to be on my social media picture but I could out there she'll never know really  with face recognition that's an issue we also have voice recognition that's pretty darn good voice signature recommend so not only would you be able to pick up on third party conversations in health care for example but you could identify who that is so these are considerations to have these are questions to be safety concerns we talked about that and then all these microphones passive monitoring is something that I'm pretty excited about I am you know if I can hear myself when I go to bed and my respiration rate maybe there is a true tool that can tell me if I high blood pressure based on the way it sounds I don't know if I would say no to that to be honest I actually might be open to saying I know these are silent killers and if I'm not that aware of myself and someone else can help me with that I might want that but we need to have to figure that out me to bed one story short between bioinformatics passive monitoring voice assistants that are gonna create new channels of interface and interaction with people and stuff were really to me kind of experiencing this Concilium as Gail Wilson would say multiple faculties and multiple disciplines sort of gelling into one I think it's more important than ever to be interdisciplinary about how we approach these problems and invite people like me who may not have expertise in your expertise to talk about ideas of problems that we see and maybe vice versa to talk about how we can help you with similar issues or or maybe you can bring up as she's very involved that can help us a lot I encourage a continued sort of dialogue amongst multiple disciplines when it comes to this especially with people in your seats or in my mind information data understanding expertise but that's the Wilson Alabama Graduate Nobel Prize winner all right I have a podcast that accidentally got popular and it's fun and the talks we have a great and I encourage you to listen and if you have questions for me anytime about getting in touch with any of the people I've had because your students I will absolutely introduce you let me know we have another conference coming up this fall all right this next fall at Harvard again based on podcasts should be bigger than this last year anyone from Michigan news in this apartment that would like to go get in contact with me either a free ticket or deeply discounted if you have friends in Boston it's a no-brainer for you if you're interested and then in Chattanooga Tennessee there is the world's largest Alexa conference that is also related to me and my friend who started a publishing company I don't make any money but we have four verticals health care being one of them storytelling another publishing another and I think automotive of the fourth so there are going to be booths there that are also a hims Chattanooga is a great town they have the fastest fiber-optic in the country they are really looking to build a tech community and have there are a lot of great startups there that you can look up yourself and find it's not an expensive place to be it's not hard to get to so if you're interested in that that did you can you arey coming up so just get in touch with me I'm more than willing to get you in I just look at the companies coming where the speakers coming in if you have interests or you know someone who is interested just connect us happily we'll do that for you and then discussion what else can I talk to you guys about what are the questions you have what did I miss out on what did I not connect with yes could you comment on the possibility its implementation your voice recognition into wearables yeah oh you had a bid on the Apple watch yeah so you bring up a good point you know first of all before I come out and say I'm not an expert on the wearable space but what I will say it with the microphone sensitivity and recognition capability is a certain start to wonder why we really need them alright so if I can tell my respiration rate I can tell my blood pressure based on the sound of my breathing my voice maybe a wearable because it actually takes the act of putting it on and charging it as a separate device every day or every third day it might negate that but you know so far the platforms work you know I think Siri is available you have to watch I'm not mistaken I think you can probably build it into any other tool as long as there's a phone or another device associated with it and it can process and do things return to you but that's as far as I really know I also think that there is some trepidation about moving forward on the wearable market mostly because of what's going on with recognition speech recognition and microphones for these devices I will take it a step further and say I don't know also I'm curious about sensitivity of the mobile mics if we're really going to be truly moving towards what's just is being mobile how sensitive our code so they are near can they do that the same capabilities is the echo daughter they echo show or equivalencies Google or any of these other companies so I'm gonna secluded I think it's something to think about it might even be a sort of a limiting factor and and their growth and utilization there's great question thanks others yeah how many times in the tuck you mentioned a scenario where I'm talking to my physician and there was a voice thing that's listening and taking our conversation and yeah that into information in the EHR yes is that like you jurors are the people working on that now keep working on it now and with the best of those systems that are available but how how accurate is the thing in taking the lay language that I've use it and actually converting that into something useful EHR you know that's accurate and yeah you talk about the you know the safety and everything which was the promise of the EHR right yeah sure so it is full of junk yeah you know one of the major issues you have when you have a patient encounter is ctrl-c ctrl-v and people do that because they're afraid although the legal research says they ought not do but it still makes going through that information as fueled and tight Texas problematic now there's sort of drop-down fields and input fields that are more accurate for screen interfaces but that's really an important question so there's a slide I showed we showed the accuracy of that processing for words dialects etc it's getting closer to 95 percent so that's not as good as humans I mean you could if you look at the research according to linguistics I misinterpret like hearing about 5% of the thing come out of your mouth even the tones of which like I might misinterpret the way you say let's go for let's leave or I'm just excited about let's go ball game for example like I'm about I'm gonna be about as good as the Google sister actually the Google assistants me so yeah that's a really great huge concern now let me break it down a little part of about house is how this might have actually work so let's say you're my my provider I'm sitting with you just a basic annual exam well you might start off by saying hey madam where she personally I'm dr. Alex and I'm here to take care of you today and when he hears dr. Alex accuse up an HNP that you know exists the patient doesn't and then you might say let's talk about some of your history and physical really quick okay so this would be kind of scripted well not so much scripting as there are phrases and words that will correlate to boxes that normally you would type now the 2.0 of that is we don't need that we can use machine learning and AI from all these recorded encounters that you might have had over 4,000 different patient encounters in your career let's say and it just says okay well dr. Alex starts with this phrase or this tone how do you he's going over at pharmacies or his little concern we can tell in his voice that this person might be abusing opiates and so let's put this in a special section code in a certain way you get the point so it starts to sort of you put what you're asking make you some prediction and then it can fill any other fields that are queryable for data which are huge or free chunks which is also important in many ways I think another question that I've asked a lot of physicians they're extremely to father by and also see the value of is why would my process and report and it's a separate sort of processing mechanisms where I can counter and then recording on that account on the one hand that's great it protects me or I can go back and say what did we talk about here because I'm curious or because we're doing a research project or it could be damning right so what I choose to have process versus what I choose to type is what I choose to be reported are sort of three different places that conversations and preferences and things like justice and fairness have to be that but to answer your question that's sort of the basic way that my your conversation with me as applied er would work where this machine is starting to input the data because it can make this on prediction based on how we programmed it or set up the system of machine learning inside of it where the AI engine we've created for it's a help I think maybe we'll end there so thank you everybody you want to email me for more info or if you want to connect and his company is are doing research and you want me to help you find someone who might have some relevancy to what you're doing reach out call me text me email just make sure you make a really clear sight on the label thank you
