in a hospital setting I think that's right right perfect all right excellent thank you so much Evans the famous guy you know how many people know that few of us don't we leave Erie if it wasn't for Evan that clinical center over there you know H might not be the same as it is now I will tell you about a lot of collaborative work so it's only is not a personal glory story it's a lot of different people with different backgrounds coming together but it was it's a very important story oh well we'll see what you think I'll let you all be the judge okeydoke but um you know for the students here I figured I'd give you kind of like an introduction to where I came from so I got my PhD in my informatics like you all are doing and I did very much non clinical work so I was working with with Charles Delisi you can ask dr. a thiol about him and all the wilds a lot of stories with him I was doing a lot of a function prediction interaction Network etc I also worked with Daniel so gray at Boston University and did a flux balance model analysis and understand genetic interaction network actinic perturbations impacted metabolism so pretty like theoretical basic research type by informatics and looking for a postdoc I was really interested in applying my bio Mattox skills to more clinically relevant research and that probably that NIH and the lab would do Lisa gray and I was really fortunate to become linked up with clinical microbiologist and clinical epidemiologists dip in a clinical Center and we were involved in a broad collaborations with the goal being killed by holding on secret thing to study that transmission and evolution the bacteria that are responsible for a hospital-acquired infection that's kind of the jumping-off point and I'll tell you a little bit some of the work that I've been doing so its signal come back in maybe been like going to sleep there we go yeah yeah that's the big organism here a lot of people were working on but I think the overall numbers are pretty shocking so so I was pretty naive to the problem when I came to NIH and here like some of the base numbers so uh complicate 5% of all hospital admissions like 2 million people in the US alone and I think obviously the big number it results in roughly a hundred thousand deaths each year to see United States and you know on first glance these are pretty shocking numbers that are not a Western culture where antibiotics are plentiful that infectious disease should exact such a toll at our healthcare system and ultimately I came to learn that there's two primary reasons leading to be really high mortality rates and the first is in a sense a good thing which is that we're much better at practicing medicine than we're used to be in advances and things like chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are keeping patients who otherwise would have succumb to their illness alive the flip side of that is these treatments often leave them in a very immunocompromised state where they're susceptible to infection that normal healthy people aren't susceptible to and the second major driver has been a really alarming rise in antibiotic resistance of these infections over the past few decades so a second thing that I learned upon studying hospital infections is that not all hospital infections are staph infections despite what you see on Hospital dramas on TV and in fact well well grant positive infections like staph aureus are important it turns out that two-thirds of the death of hospital-acquired infection are from gram negatives and here's some of the major gram-negative players and their relative abundances and I see you Zack off United States and you know that they're already a cause for alarm because of the mortality rates and they're becoming an increasing calls for an alarm because some of the major players have shown the really striking capacity to evolve resistance to antibiotics for short period of time so this is data from the same study looking at gram negatives and I see use across the United States and now what I'm showing you the rates of multi-drug resistance in 1993 and 2004 all eight different species and you see that for some of them just in this roughly 10 year period you're seeing huge increases in multi-drug resistance so that the two organism I'm going to talk about today are Klebsiella pneumoniae and that's needed back to bomani arista threefold and six-fold increase in multi-drug resistance in ten year period and the story's actually even worse than this where they're strains of a sunita bacteria club yella there are now being seen in IC use the united states that are resistant to every single antibiotic we have and we've seen some of these strains in our hospitals and essentially when a patient has an infection with a sort of organism that there's nothing you could do for them they're put on palliative care and and that's all that can be done so it really gotten to the point of being a crisis and fortunately that the powers that be are now starting to recognize the severity of this problem and just in the past year that the CDC and the Presidential Commission of Science and Technology released reports kind of laying out the packbow or how to deal with this crisis and I kind of want to give you a quick couple of bullet points of the highlights of these studies because I think they pretty much are saying the same thing and that the first thing they're both saying is that we need more effective prevention strategies we're at a point now where we have untreatable infections in our Hospital and what needs to be done as a better understanding of how infections spread so that we could implement more targeted infection control procedures to try to get a hold of them second we need more informed treatment strategies so when the doctor has a patient with an infection in the hospital it takes at least 48 hours for that doctor and it was certainly what's causing the infection and what drugs that infected acceptable too so for that first 48 hour the doctor essentially being treating the patient blindly which is clearly not optimal for treating the patient effectively but it's equally bad in terms of giving drugs that could potentially lead to the evolution of resistance so we need technological breakthroughs that will provide doctors with information to ideally treat patients in real-time and finally to state the obvious we need more drugs and the current pipeline especially for gram gram negatives is dry there are is nothing in the pipeline and you know a flipside of that in addition to developing more drugs we need to better understand how to use the drugs we have to limit the evolution of resistance and maintain the efficacy as long as we possibly can so yes yeah so yeah that was in both reports and I think that kind of goes to stewardship like how we as a society and at a global society are disseminating and using antibiotics and and how they should be regulated both within a single healthcare institution and across the world and it's clearly a global problem where resistance evolving in one part of the world or in one institutions affects everyone and those are the sort of solutions that are required so what I'm going to talk about is the potential of genomic revolution in hospital infection control and I'm gonna do that in the most egotistical way possible by just telling you about my work but there's been a lot of really cool work in the past couple of years that I think has recognized that genomic can really be a game changer in something that can immediately be translational and in this realm so I actually wanted the first quickly mention two projects that I worked on that I think are maybe more interesting from a computational perspective and a comparative genomics perspective but then I'm going to spend the bulk of the talk talking about two problems I think are more clinically interesting just to kind of give you an idea of the the seriousness of the problem and how genomics might really impact the serious problems so the first project I worked on when I came to the NIH was was using whole genome sequencing to understand an outbreak of multi drug-resistant Acinetobacter and the way this project started is the clinical microbiology came to us and said we had this outbreak and we don't understand it and what they didn't understand is that they never had multi drug-resistant Acinetobacter in the hospital before but their standard molecular typing imposes we're talking about they'd read different strain types so what that what do you make of that right like they don't understand so the question was where they really unlucky and had these three independent strains come to the hospital the same time which is plausible this is becoming a more prevalent organism or whether standard molecular typing approach is misleading them so what we did is they performed whole genome sequencing on each of the major strain type and really able to understand what happened were able to see trace two of the strains back to a single patient who likely brought the strains from another hospital people to trace the third strain back to a non multi drug-resistant strain president in the hospital a year before the outbreak that an intervening year had involved multi drug-resistant and gone on to cause an outbreak and this was really quite quite amazing to us and to our clinical microbiology colleagues that you know this technology which at the time and this is 2009-2010 really hadn't been up items realm and was giving them information that was meats and downs beyond any sort of molecular typing or any other paving methodology that that they had available to them this is really exciting to us the second work what they I want to briefly mention was something I did more recently with a really talented postback student joy yang and with doing what we did we developed a computational pipeline automatically designed multiplex PCR typing assays from genomic data so the way this will work is you take an input a bunch of be known sequences for whatever organism you're interested in and what will happen is the optimal set of prime repair will be selected to distinguish all the inputs trained in a multiplex fashion and I think that the significance of this work and work like it is that you know the application of genomics have to track infections in hospitals doesn't have to be limited in the short-term to those hospitals that can afford to put sequences in the clinical microbiology lab and that there's a glut of Danone like data especially for bacteria that could be mined and creative ways to design clinical assays that could be implemented right now in a cost-effective manner okay so with that I'll move on to the two major stories yes yeah yeah so I think that I think the infrastructure is there or can be there to go into clinical micro lab and what I expect will happen at that loom and I will team up with with some more traditional clinical micro company which is already happening and that's the deal in the past few weeks with a bio Remi oh and you know working together they'll go they'll have a all-in-one infrastructure that can be implemented at labs but I think in the short term that's going to be limited to larger academic institutions that that are a little more flush and there are a lot of smaller institutions other sorts of health care settings besides acute care hospitals like nursing homes like long-term acute care hospitals that need more financially realistic methodologies and exploiting genomic data to design these sort of T pepid ologies I think is a way to go in the future early for the short term yes yeah okay he does they do this time for our turnaround yeah they would they will do a whole genome genome sequencing on any pathogen for the Canadian Public Health Service yeah and they're guaranteed 24-hour terminal yeah and I mean it's it's pretty amazing I don't know if it was worth but he's been doing this since about 2005 now it's mostly for our will see on things that aren't really known where people don't really know the cause of illness yeah caused him something like severe it has some acronym yeah almost like sad or SAP yeah that's letters pathogens or something like that yeah so there's been some studies that have gotten a lot of press like New England Journal Medicine level studies where there's been an unknown infectious agent and on seek directly sequence clinical samples and identify that agent antidote and yeah this work is pretty phenomenal and I think you know in the study that I'm going to talk about time was elimination and the quickest we could really get a sequence from the clinical I slit was 72 hours which is fast but it's not real time fast where doctors really need information with an hour it's pretty practically useful but but I think that hurdle will be overcome sooner than later so the first three I want to talk to you about is the application of genomics to study an evolution of resistance to a last line drug and a sonido vector and the second story will be using old genome sequencing detracted outbreak of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella at the danger Clinical Center so the Acinetobacter story was published last year in genome research so this is data from the same study looking at antibiotic resistance and ICS across the United States except now I'm just showing you press and you go back there and I broke it down to individual drugs and I really just want to emphasize that a trend is the same again this is just a 10-year period you're seeing increasing levels of resistance to every single drug except for this blip which i think is an artifact in the study and and by the end of this study the only Darley the reasonable rate of susceptibility or what's called carbapenems and as you might expect these became the go-to drug to treat multi drug-resistant Acinetobacter and as you also might expect if you took this out to 2013 you'd see a sharp increase and carbapenem resistance so so again we're left in a place where there's really no effective drugs to treat this organism in multi drug-resistant strains of its organism so the lack of available drugs led doctors to reach back into the past yes go ahead there Stefan elation of resistances where there is an obviously selective benefit to accumulated many resistances as possible and that met what we've seen yeah I mean part of it was the the order which they were developed that this is happening over several decades that they can waken of these resistances yeah but but yeah I mean what done is you know like I said doctor won't know immediately what the susceptibility is it takes 48 hours so they have to treat the first 40 hours based on assumption and and and for the best interest of the patient they're gonna use that's the most broad spectrum drug that they can use and then if they can they'll tone it down after that and that's part of the problem and that's why we need to be able to know with certainty what the resistance is in real time to tease the most specific drug you can use and see that the higher level drugs really really multi drug-resistant strain that that would be the optimal thing to do so the lack of availability of standard drugs has led doctors to tweak back into the past and go to this drug colistin which was used in the 70s and then discontinued because of associated neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity now there are no other options so you're going to deal with these side effects to treat these severely resistant infections Kalista does academic peptide antibiotic so the way it works is it's positively charged it interacts with a negatively charged bacterial membrane gets into the periplasmic space and ultimately causes membrane disruption and lysis so now that Kalista news has begun to increase we of course have seen resistance begun to emerge in hospital and whole genome sequencing clinical isolates has revealed this PMR operon is really important and resistance that we see the patient occurring in this region of the genome in resistant isolate and when resistance of all that typically happens as follows so it's a bleeding operon and will typically have a mutation in PM RB which is signal transduction kinase this is now a single point mutation so it's a very easy resistance to get and it will hyper activate the kinase being a hyper phosphorylation of a p.m. or a transcription factor with auto-regulatory so this drive transcription of the whole circuit he couldn't thirteen which is really the payload of resistance and he codes in ethanol Ian's transfer rate which transferred ethanolamine moieties to the bacterial membrane decreases the negative charge and inhibits interaction with the drug and provides resistance so the question is now that we've seen resistance begin to emerge in hospitals is widespread Kalista resistance slowdown conclusion which again would mean essentially the end of antibiotic era for multi drug-resistant Acinetobacter and other very resistant gram negatives and kind of that the obvious answer is of course widespread resistance is going to occur it can be acquired really easily a single point mutation and why should Calista be different from them and all the other drugs that we've seen fall by the wayside but there is an alternative camp who who's kind of holding out hope that Calista might be special and they hold their head on two things the first is that Clifton is part of a larger class of drug called antimicrobial peptides and members of this class of drugs are also part of the innate human immune system people have observed that they've maintained their efficacy against potential bacterial invaders over millions of years suggesting that there might be something fundamental about this class of drug and associative economic mechanism of resistance that might make stable resistance really difficult to evolve at least for certain organisms and that's a little hand wavy but in a hard experimental evidence that this might be true comes from both in vitro and animal studies showing that Acinetobacter acquires a really significant Fitness cost when to become resistant to this drug so becoming resistant Cliffton results in it growing slower and being less ritalin in the animal model so that there's something at play here and I just want to say a little bit more about this idea of a fitness cost because it's really critical to understanding the rest of the talk so resistance to many antibiotics is associate with the cost and the the rationale makes a lot of sense so antibiotics are inherently targeting a central bacterial machinery which has been optimized over billions of years so mutating this machinery in order to evade action of the drug comes at a cost but you're gonna grow a little bit slower but that being said given that most drugs come at the cost we've seen stable resistance evolve to other drugs so what's happened so there's two ways around this the first is to obtain you know the jackpot the low-cost mutation which provides resistance with a minimal Fitness cost and interestingly if you look at clinical Islip that were isolating from infections in hospitals they're enriched for these low cost mutations kind of further demonstrating the significance of the idea of a fitness cost so these are the ones that are the most say it to me to the one that that are spreading through a hospital and I'll turned in route test stabilizing resistance is to get a secondary mutation on top of the resistance mutation that alleviates the fitness caused so the big question is are either of these possibilities available for collision resistance in a sonido back there so that brings us to the current study this is what we're interested in understanding whether there's low cost or secondary mutation that can alleviate that fitness cost of collisions in essen a defector so the patient population are 40 patients at the NIH Clinical Center who crabbed multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections that were treated with Kalista of these 40 patients we seen resistance evolved in more patients and I think really importantly it appears that resistance evolve de novo II to be patient because their initial isolate was susceptible to the drug so florid for TV series isn't involved again a high probability resistance and also importantly after resistant isolates were taken from these patients Kalista treatment with stock because of the Associated toxicity of the drug so this is kind of we're starting we're ready to sequence these resistant genome and look for low-cost mutation and we made an observation that that was really interesting and kind of made us rethink how we were approaching the study and this is what the observation was it's that soon after the drug was taken away and these four patient resistance appeared to disappear so this is one patient here's the x-axis is time the y-axis is the level collision resistance this dotted line is the clinical threshold for what you would call resistant I slit and the grey box is the Clifton treatment window so we see the initial isolate sensitive treatment of quick Clifton starts we're getting a resistant isolates in this patient treatment stops and now we're getting acceptable I flip this was like a week after the drug was taken away and we see the same phenomenon in all four patients and what this really is indicating is now an in vivo manifestation of the fitness cost right as soon as the selective pressure of the drug goes away susceptible eye slits are quickly out competing resistant ones and we take in the infection and this is pretty amazing to us this is not something that's ever been seen I'm what any other reason drug combination and what what it implies is one we're not to look for for low-cost mutations we clearly don't exist because acceptable isolates are quickly out computers resistant ones but what it suggests it might be interesting is that what's happening here to cause him to lose resistance and what are the implications of this on whether Clifton resistance will become widespread and that really became the critical question that we were interested in answering yeah so it depends on the pathogen asking you go back there's kind of a very difficult one to control because it could survive them a GI tract it can survive on your skin and it can survive on inanimate objects for long period it's hard so there's many different ways where I could spread in the literature there's outbreaks associated with contaminated ventilators with humidifiers which is kind of frightening with anything you could think of its it yeah yeah yeah and especially with asking you to back there and uh another arrangement antara caucus yeah so the study design was extremely simple we performed whole genome sequencing on longitudinal isolates from each patient including the initial susceptible I slit at least one resistant isolate in the post treatment susceptible isolate and the first thing we find is kind of is confirming what we knew we looked at the resistant isolates and they all have mutations in in PM RB which is what had been found in previous studies and just to confirm that this made sense we also measure the expression levels of Piran locus and they were constituent activated in all resistant isolates so this is again just kind of a sanity check and confirming that things make sense and now the more interesting question about how is resistance being lost in these different patients and a priority there's three possibilities the first is reversion you could have a mutation conferring resistance to the secondary mutation going back to the ancestral phenotype you could have reimagined 318 mutation causing resistance and then once the drug is gone the ancestral susceptible population comes and retakes the infection and you can imagine this happening if you have an anatomical site we're excited tactic good concentrations are treating then once the drug is gone it can kind of be diffused throughout the patient or you could have an adornment population of bacteria that once the drug is gone again could come and receive the infection the final possibility is compensation where you could have mutation conferring resistance and the secondary mutation of bleeding resistance and before moving on I just really want to emphasize that this third possibility fundamentally different than the other two in the sense that what you end up with in the end is different than what you started with and it's different in a really important way whether there's been a secondary mutation that has essentially deactivated the resistance locus to this drug and could have implications on the capacity for the future evolution of resistance yes go ahead it could probably depends on the patient and what really drives the resistance are pre-existing mutations so it depends on how large the bacterial population and the patient is at the beginning but it's not like a virus where every single possible mutation of the genome exists at all times it's it's lower mutation rate and lower population levels but but that's a really good question and picking about populations is kind of where the field is going but we didn't have that the sample to do that here so what do we see in our floor patients well the first patient we see a compensatory mutation so to kind of step back for a second looking along the tune when these four patients we see between two and ten mutations occurring over time I'm only gonna show you mutations in the PM are just for simplicity and because you can really dip a take home message just by looking at mutations at this locus so the resistance isolate we see the PM RB mutation as I mentioned in this to refresh your memory this is activating the signal transduction kinase hyper fossil energy factor driving transcription from the locus and providing resistance now in the post treatments acceptable Iseult we still have this PMR be mutation so presumably this kinase is still hyperactivated but now we have a mutation to PM ra that transcription factor and if you look closely at where this mutation is it's right smack in the middle of the DNA binding domain of a transcription factor so what appears to have happened is that in order to lose resistance it's essentially mutated and destroyed the transcription factor that's critical to resistance which again is this like kind of dumb pounding test that accidentally by giving a patient that drug and taken away we've selected for for the organism took to destroy this critical locus and it made us wonder what would have happened if we brought them drug back to the patient would it be harder to evolve resistance again and that the idea is that initially was very easy to mutate PM RB to evolve resistance there's lots of different ways you could you could change amino acid sequence and confer exists if then we see that based on the fact that we see different mutations in each patient but once you have the PMR a mutation of the DNA binding domain it could be really hard to undo you might need a true aversion to bring resistance back so this is a retrospective study so we couldn't do this obviously in the patient so we we had the eye slits we won the see is it harder for this post treatment stuff to light slit to become resistant so we did a very simple experiment we measured the rates of collision resistance mutations in vitro for the pretreatment stuffable a slit and the one with the p.m. re mutation and the way the experiment works did you start with a small bacterial population you grow to non-selective media just to accumulate mutational heterogeneity and he played the population at a clifton plate a non-selective plate and you look at the frequency of mutations so I did this experiment myself which is one of the first sexual experiments I did with my hand and I kept getting different results every single time and you know my first intuition is that you know I'm a novice so this must be experimental incompetence but ultimately I learned that it was an experimental incompetence that there was a Nobel Prize winning reason why I kept it in different results and it's as follows maybe you're familiar with this experiment so the number of Calista Madison colony if you get and depending on when the mutation occurred in the outgrowth so in each of these three cases there was a single resistance mutation that occurred but the number of colonies C depends on whether it happened early or whether early or late in the outgrowth right so the way around this is to do the experiment many times though the distribution of the number of Calissa minutes and Col for the most likely associated mutation rate to explain the distribution and this is what Lurie and Bellbrook did in their Nobel Prize and they experiment this is what I thankfully discovered that I should do before I've submitted his paper so I didn't buy a total jacket and this is what I did and here's the results so you see two distributions this is the pretreatment susceptible I slit this is the post treatments of the laser with the plra mutation the distributions are clearly very different be it for mutation rates are different and it's highly significant so again the critical tikal message to me is that phenotypically these isolate identical there is acceptable to the drug but they differ in their capacity to long resistance but there would be no way for a doctor to know that without having the genetic information and without having the nuanced understanding of the mechanism resistance to be able to predict that this PMR a mutation should inhibit the capacity to evolve resistance so that's just one patient what about the other three so patient two and three both have PMR be mutations in the resistant isolates and they're both gone and they're susceptible I slit so we think it's me emergence in principle this could be explained by a reversion but based on the other mutations that I'm not showing you it's likely re-emergence although again it doesn't really matter the key thing is that what you end up with is what you started with fourth patient also looks likely emergence we sequence two resistant isolates here they have different PM RB mutations likely this population effect we're sampling different with this nice little in the population but regardless both number gone after you pull the drug away so at this point things are actually looking pretty good for Clifton right we have four patients admittedly a small number but in three of the four patients you're no worse off than he started with in terms of being able to bring back the drug and having it be efficacious again in one case he might still be better than he started with where the drug is more likely to not incur resistance so unfortunately the study didn't end on this optimistic point and can we continue to push on and the reason that we didn't stop here because of an observation made in our clinical microbiology lab so when a sample comes into clinical microbiology see a sputum sample go plait it out and they'll look at the colony morphologies and if they're all the same they'll take a single colony and they look it up and determine the susceptibilities and that's kind of end of the day and that's what was done for all the samples in the study except for samples taken from patients or while this patient was on the Kalista treatment when they played Abby's samples out they had two different colony morphology they had large colonies and small colonies the small colonies it turned out at Clifton resistance and these are the one-week sequence that had these PMR be mutation the large colonies at ranaut are susceptible to queston and we sequence them and they have the ancestral PMR genotype of patient for an initial isolated right so apparently susceptible dina type so first of all knowing that the collision resistant phenotype explained the different colony were quadrate this is another manifestation of the fitness cause resistant isolates grow slower so they have smaller colonies but from from a clinical perspective the key question is why are we isolating Clifton susceptible isolates from the patient receiving the drug at an anatomical site where it appeared that cytotoxic drug concentrations based on the fact that were we're isolating resistant isolates and the concerning possibility was that maybe patient ward and missile I slit already had a low level of crystal resistance that we weren't detecting that was allowing it to stay in the population during the course of treatment so to test this hypothesis if we went back to the genome sequences and we took advantage of the fact that patient chi-lin patient floor were part of the same outbreak so they had very closely related strains and we asked is there something special in the genome of patient for an initial islip that distinguish it from patient to the Mitchell isolate that could explain this observation in clinical micro so it turns out that there were eight amino acid changing mutations differentiating these strains and one of the eights and PM RB there's this critical dean for collision resistance so this doesn't seem like a coincidence we went into the expression measurements and in fact patient for the initial I slit has significantly higher PMR expression than patient twos initial susceptible I slit and I think also important to note it has significantly less P mark brush and then patient to resist my explicit somehow a mutation that confers an intermediate activation of this this trick signal transduction cascade an intermediate expression and intermediate level resistance that was totally missed by the clinical assay and to kind of hammer at home and put the final nail in the coffin we did a different Calista resistant assay so the clinical micro lab that are in a plate based assay we did a broth based assay and using that we found clinically significant levels of resistance in patient portal initial eye slits so it had just been missed by the clinical micro lab because this mutation provided a phenotype that was missed by their assay so to summarize this part first I think that somebody the bad news is that we see a stable close to existence mutation emerge undetected by clinical assay and we went on to show that that this resistant mutation was transmitted to other patients so this is what you were concerned about right we're having now a stable mutation that that's fit enough to actually be transmitted to other patients and I put resistance in quotes here because it's not really a true resistance mutation right you see other p.m. RB mutations happen on top of this genetic background what it really is is the mutation that predicts the evolution of resistance it provides kind of a low-level resistance that allows the bacteria to stick around during peep during treatment require better mutations but then at the same time come back and we take the population after the drug is gone and kind of beating off this same point it could be a broad mutational mechanism that could allow for a circumvention of high cost resistance mutations so you know again you have this would be resistance mutation that provides just a little bit of resistance but with very minimal fitness cost you can stick around during the presence of the drug which is inherently a temporary inconvenience and when the drug is gone you can come and retake the infection and be transmitted to other patients which is what we observe but I think there is some good news and I think that the first piece of good news is that genomic analysis revealed that the proper selective pressure the probability of resistance devolution can be decreased so so here this was in a really trivial way accidentally by giving a drug and pulling it away we selected for eye slits that had trouble evolving resistance to Calista but you could imagine doing this in more intelligent ways where say you had combinations of drugs where the first drug is given to be kefir the probability of resistance to a second drug and since this paper had been published there has actually been publications that have come out showing the combinations of existing antibiotics have this property which they term collateral sensitivity or resistance to one drug what will select receptively to another and you can imagine both in in long term colonized patients using any sort of treatment strategies and also within a hospital using these sort of strategies to use one drug for a period of time in a hospital kind of wipe out resistance tool to the other drug and cycle back and forth in an intelligent way like that the second piece of good news I think is that genomics inform the current and future state of resistant strain so we could we could look at this PMR a mutation and predict that resistance to Clifton should be difficult to evolve we could look at this PM RB mutation inpatient floor and say you know the the clinical phenotype is telling us it's susceptible but this looks like an resistance mutation and I think what's this speaks to is is the need for genetic information to supplement phenotypic assays when doctors are deciding what drugs to use for patients would be added benefit that this can be information that is given much quicker to a doctor so I think that the first story really sets up the second so we're seeing that the final drugs that we had to treat these infections fall by the wayside and again now the onus is really on infection prevention in the short term and what I'm going to talk about is the use of genome sequencing to try to understand how infections are spreading in hospitals with the ultimate goal to understand to a point where we can implement infection control protocols that will really limit the spread of infections so a little background on club viola outbreaks and they primarily occur among immunocompromised patients and the way they're thought to spread is primarily patient the patient on the hand of health care workers and on medic devices so unlike Acinetobacter it's not very stable in the environment it's not typically long-term colonizing room their infrastructure this is really short-term spread going from room to room and what makes these outbreak really difficult to control is a in addition to causing infections clubs yellow could a symptomatically colonize patients GI tracks and what this what this does is it creates silent reservoirs for ongoing transmission where unless you identify all these case symptomatically colonized patients these outbreaks clearly continue in perpetuity so up to 2011 we were quilts knit not to have any carbapenem losses in Klebsiella pneumoniae which is what we're talking about here and carbapenem to being but that really last line drug virtually we've infection so they're they're very serious and then we had our first patient who was transferred in from another hospital and this patient was actually known to be colonized with an organism upon arrival so Timmerman an outbreak situation this patient was immediately placed in contact isolation and there were two exceptions to this patient being in isolation with her to 24 hours since the patient spent in the ICU as part of their their standard care and to try to assure that no transmissions take took place both throat and growing surveillance cultures were done on every other patient in ICU they all came back negative so it seemed that everything was fine this patient ultimately left the hospital in mid-july and there'd been no other cases so everything seemed good three weeks after patient one left a second patient came up positive and then a third fourth fifth and then the floodgates opened and when all is said and done I told 18 patients had been affected and 12 those 18 patients ultimately succumb to their infections which is pretty standard for the mortality rates for for this sort of organism in this really immunocompromised patient population and in fact people left to wonder what had happened here and despite following all the proper infection control procedures this had happened and and to really understand what had gone wrong there were there were two critical questions I think the first question is what is the link between this first patient and the rest of the outbreak is it just a coincidence that this patient was here or is there a causal link I mean York Hospital which is where this organism is is most prevalent in the country and regardless of whether patient was linked to the outbreak that the really striking observation is that once the second patient came up positive things happen real fast it was one a week for four months so so why did things happen so quickly here and not here if patient one was length so so how could we begin to understand what had happened here and try to recreate this outbreak so do you mean - I do like surveillance culturing I'm sorry where did that question oh so they didn't in the study they're doing an anonymous study - now to do that they're all coming back negative but they're like major ethical and legal ramifications to doing those sorts of things that I think have have limited that from being done more broadly and the the limitation is what if a nurse is colonized with this pain resistant organism and they can't be decolonize easily what do you do do you fire them but but it's not that easy right and that's the easy answer I agree but it's not a trivial decision to make it is more complicated but that being said other places in the world are doing this and there have been studies published out of the UK where they have done surveillance on healthcare workers in a case of a neonatal mersa outbreak they traced it back to health care worker and they published it so it open debate and above my prank pay grade unfortunately yes good yeah yeah yeah so yeah that's right on the head and I think there's advantages to it in term in terms of resources in terms of isolates in terms of being a research environment and facilitating the study when we did it yeah it's it's a very resource rich environment which is which is one of the points I was moving to earlier that in the near term it's unlikely that this is implemented in a real-time in all hospitals it's just not practical but I think the lessons that you can learn from doing this in large centers can be applied broadly and I think that'll be a take-home message here that what we learned here can be used elsewhere in a in more research resource limited settings so what's traditionally done outbreak investigations are molecular typing approaches other than genome sequencing so for club yella that are not coldsteel dielectrophoresis where you take genomic DNA you chop it up with a restriction enzyme you run that on the gel and you have like a molecular fingerprint right Rep PCR you do PCR and repetitive regions of the genome and again you put it on a gel and have them like a fingerprint it turns out when you apply these approaches to the eighty nice little outbreak they give identical banding patterns so there was really no information distinguishing the isolates but you might say well at least you could link patient one to the outbreak because it's got the same banding pattern but it turns out that that's not even true because carbapenem resistant Club DL is highly clonal newest hospital system and having an identical banding pattern doesn't distinguish a transmission within the outbreak from an independent introduction so there's really zero information here that's totally worthless and you could see to emphasize that I put a really low-quality graphic so like they're typing doesn't work what about gum tree epidemiology kind of a standard of care here I'm showing you traditional epidemiological data is called a patient race on x-axis P of time y-axis we have our different patients and the different colors represent different words where the patients were during the course of the outbreak outbreak so we think that these outbreaks are spreading patient to patient by a healthcare workers hand and medical devices so it stands to reason that transmission should be happening between patients who are in the same word at the same time during a period when we think transmissions are happening right so so what if we tried to recreate the outbreak using this sort of assumption can we recreate the paths of transmissions so this is what that network looks like and you can see it's not a pretty one and and the reason it's not a pretty one is that this is primarily an ICU outbreak so one overlap with everyone so again that there's there's no inflammation here and this is what ultimately led us to buy whole genome sequencing and again the idea is really it is not very complicated we have our outbreak you have our eye slits we identify the mutations and we use really standard phylogenetic approaches to infer the ancestry of isolates and then in turn and for a putative path of transmission and we were not the first ones to it to a pilot's idea in fact in the years leading up to this study there were several really high-profile papers applying whole genome sequencing to study the world wide dissemination like the who who of infectious agents so this is a really cool figure from a paper looking at the worldwide dissemination of Vibrio cholera so what they did is they took I slipped in debris open all over the world isolated over the past several decades before I'm told you know sequencing did a slightly more sophisticated phylogenetic analysis and it came up with this map and among the interesting thing is you can infer from this map or that also be pandemic waves of cholera emerge from the same part of the world from Bangladesh and in that kind of tournament of the time able to trace the origin of the the cholera strain that caused the Haitian outbreak after the 2010 earthquake and before the sequencing was done it was assumed that the source was South America or Latin America for obvious geographical proximity but genome sequencing pointed to the fact that it was from the same part of the world Southeast Asia and of some quick epidemiological investigations supported this and ultimately linked the strain to Nepalese UN peacekeepers so now we're seeing genomic data driving epidemiological investigations which is really what we want to do here and ideally what we want is to take this sort of map and put on our Hospital so so let's do that but can we is the question so so this sort of study is relying on variation that's accumulating over decades we're trying to infer events that are happening over days and weeks and a priori it's not obvious whether Klebsiella or any other Hospital pathogen is mutating fast enough to give us the variation that's sufficient to make these sorts of inferences potentially you could sequence there are 18 isolates from this four month outbreak and they could all be identical and would be no better off than pulsed field so that was kind of a risk we're taking and our first indication that this was in the case is looking just at isolates from patient one from different anatomical sites over time we seen variance so here I'm showing you different isolates on the on the y-axis and variable positional x-axis so there's six million base pairs in the club viola genome and of those 6 million base pairs there's 7 positions whether or not identical so these are very very closely related but there are differences so this is encouraging kind of at the risk of reading too much into the data there also seems to be an anatomical structure to mutational patterns were isolates from the urine are identical and have different mutational patterns from the BL and the groin which in turn of the different mutation pattern and growth but but that's neither here or there the critical thing is that we're seeing variation because encouraging to us next we look at the full set of isolates so again the eye slits on the y-axis label positions on the x axis and now we're seeing roughly 40 of variable positions at a 6 million so still very closely related but difference is roughly half of the variants are unique to a single isolate so they're not useful for a phylogenetic analysis the other half are shared among different sets of patients and there's a clear structure there which you could see based on the way I clustered it and potentially you could use these these patterns of shared variants to infer train bits in the outbreak so this is great but but can we actually learn anything that that's clinically interesting so the first thing that's very clear is that patient 1 is part of this outbreak we see a single nucleotide variant distinguishing patient ones throat isolate from the isolate from patients 3 and 5 and it's in the context of the rest of the variation that we're seeing evolving there the question is outbreak I mean that's as clear as you can get that that this patient is part of this outbreak I think even more interesting than linking the patient was additional evidence that there were multiple transmissions coming from this patient so you see - two major clusters here this first patient with patients 2 3 and 5 share the mutational patterns and patient 1/3 I slit everyone else tears the mutational pattern from patient ones BL and growing isolates and because we know the patient one started the outbreak we know these variants involved in patient 1 we have a flow of directionality from patient 1 to be other patients so at least to transmission then actually have a hypothesize more than two transmissions based on the genomic data and this is really critical if you remember back patient one was discharged three weeks before anyone had any idea of an outbreak so what this is telling us is that the reason that things that had a control so fast here is not because there were a lot of transmissions after this point but there were a lot of transmissions that went undetected early on patient's were a symptomatically colonized and by the time anyone needed an outbreak it was probably all over the place what this also tells us it when when these transmissions likely occurred right so and the obvious culprit is these two 24 hours since that this patients been in ICU when groin and throat surveillance cultures were done to try to rule that transmissions and ultimately the hospital's wish to rectal surveillance cultures which are much more sensitive for detecting houston federally colonized patients because it's colonized in the GI tract and this is really critical totally summing the tide of the out rape outbreak so the really important thing is that now we're providing hard evidence for wearing when things went wrong what could be changed to prove this from happening in the future and explaining kind of this broad epidemiological phenomenon that would have really been unexplainable through any other way so that was kind of nice and then and Terry picking specific questions that were interested in bubsley ultimately what we want to do is infer the circuitry admission graph so I implemented a maximum parsimony algorithm on a graph which is called Edmunds algorithm to on a minimum spanning tree on a directed graph and this is what it gives you and among interesting things that again now it's not one two but three transmissions stemming from patient one which makes sense when you look at the genomic data and I just want to go through actually one additional predicted transmission just to kind of emphasize a point and the predicted transmission of going one the three to two so first of all the numbers indicate when patients came up positive so the reason you could even have an out-of-order transmission and because the capacity for asymptomatic combination dictates that when a patient came up positive isn't necessarily that the order in which they acquired it right so this is possible but does it make sense so if you look at the genome sequences the reason that that transmission is being predicted because of a single mutation of a genome of that explicated to which is not in the Islip the patient's 1 and 3 with the presumption being that the mutation happened after the trade mission from 3 to 2 so that's great but but does it make sense if you go back and look at the epidemiology and in fact it does we see that patient one overlaps the patient 3 in both 24-hour symptom ICU patients who never overlap with patient 1 but later on although a sufficient degree in ICU so now we're seeing the McDade in epidemiological data are telling us the same thing and this is really where the power of this approach is going to come the genomic data can't give you everything and epidemiological data is really you know unvalidated by putting them together you really gain a complete understanding of what's going on here so what did this study yield but the first thing I think it clearly yielded is that to Nam provide unprecedented resolution and tracking spread of hospital pathogens we provided hard evidence that Club GL outbreak can spread undetected for extended period of time and we provided evidence for wearing one breaches in infection control place what did the study not yield so I kind of want to pump the brakes a little bit and and not leave you thinking that that this is liquor also it didn't provide an infallible map of all transmissions that happen throughout the outbreak and there's actually a good deal of walk that this was so successful so the critical piece of luck is that what we were interested in was these transmissions really early in the outbreak and because we knew that patient 1/3 of the outbreak once we were able to link them Deneau mcclee we had a kind of flow of directionality for the transmission you knew everything originated with patient 1 if we didn't know that they could become much trickier so so let's look at another example we have patients solvent their team which have an identical mutational profile and only two patients in the whole outbreak that have the mutational profile so it's reasonable to infer that there's likely a transmission between these two patients but when the 12 the 13 or 13 to 12 totally non obvious and there's really no information here to give you the answer to that things can become much worse so if you look at this this Edmond algorithm transmission graph you it looks like patient six really it's a big problem here I it looks like a super spreader but that's really not the case so if you look at the genomic data in the middle of the outbreak there's very little variation accumulating and this is just one of many possibilities to explain the the genomic data so really what I'm getting at is their while they are evolving best not to give us some insight there's not sufficient mutation to completely parse everything out but there's clearly information here so so how do we strike the balance and really use this information to its to its maximum oil effect and I think what has to be done is to to really use the denominator to rule out transmissions that couldn't have happened look at the reduce set of possible transmissions and hopefully find enrichments for clinically interesting things in this reduce set of possible transmissions and I want to spend two slides just telling you about one example of how we're trying to do that right now so this is now looking at another organism vancomycin-resistant in Tara caucus and we performed whole genome sequencing on roughly sixty I slipped at the NIH Clinical Center for your period and what we attempted to do is again houston ohmic data to limit transmissions overlay epidemiological data about where cases were in the hospital again to reduce transmissions and look at this reduce set to see if we can learn something about the epidemiology of this organism so in the past several years there have been a lot of what's called a case control study trying to understand factors that put patients at risk for acquiring BRE or vancomycin-resistant in Tara caucus so what you'll typically do is have patients that have the are you have patients that don't and see what's happening you know in the 14 days or 30 days prior to getting the infection that seems to be enriching patients for putting patients at risk but there's I think an underlying flaw in these studies what they're assuming that they're doing is you know you know when a patient came up positive so you looked look in the window right before they came up positive and say okay what's happening here but there's another possibility which is this asymptomatic colonization so just because a patient came up positive here doesn't mean they acquired here they could have been colonized for a very long period of time and acquired it long ago and then something happened to here where you're able to did or maybe just didn't look book right and it's really important to distinguish these two populations because what you're finding here are factors that put patients at risk for acquiring or into them what you're finding here are factors that put patients at risk for testing positive which is equally valuable to know because you could target these patients first-round culturing when you find these factors so we wanted to use to notice in epidemiology the split these groups up and the way we did that is we put patients in this group if they have a genetically plausible transmission scenario from another patient and with whom they overlap in the hospital in the 14 days prior to coming up positive those are patients who are recent acquisition if you don't have that scenario we seem that your long term colonized so we split patients up like that and we asked okay when you split patients up like this are there differences in antibiotics that these patients are receiving prior to coming up positive and in fact kind of my surprise because this is kind of complicated data set and and and clinical data that we did find something interesting so if you looked at the long-term colonized patients there's a single antibiotic that they're enriched in or I'll make a myosin so remember these are vancomycin resistant and tear a caucus so patients receive vancomycin and you're essentially wiping out and making myosin susceptible organism and lifting for vancomycin resistant organisms and that makes sense that you'd be able to detect a symptomatic colonized patients when they're receiving world mega myosin so this is this is nice actually make sense which doesn't often happen with clinical research so Tessa team is highly enriched for patients that recently acquired BRE and this doesn't make immediate sense to us in and and what I hypothesized was going on if there's actually a hidden confounding factor that patients that are was receiving prophylactics of tasmad Emer enriched in some sort of underlying condition and we're bringing in additional clinical data to try to identify this potential confounder but I think it's pretty clear that these patients have been split up in a in a meaningful way and this is really exciting to us and I think this is kind of where the field is going now trying to use genomic data to split patient populations up in different ways to understand possible transmissions and look for clinical in which means and this is the sort of information that can can really be used in hospitals to change clinical practice hopefully for the better so overall conclusions we see that genome sequencing can inform transmission and evolution possible pathogens and I think that the writing's on the wall that is the speed increases in the cost decreases it's going to become feasible to incorporate this in in standard clinical microbiology workflows and and with mil time insights in the transmission and resistance pacing treatment can be optimized so just to thank everyone involved in that work so julissa gray with my postdoctoral mentor and it was a really fantastic I couldn't have asked for anything anything more from my mentor and I had obviously a very productive and exciting postdoc largely thanks to her clinical Center epidemiology Tara Palmer David Henderson are the team head epidemiologist and I only want to thank them because in ER they were really doing the important work right there they're really managing the outbreak and dealing would be patient and trying to herd that infection from spreading but at the same time I think they recognized that the power of the transformative nature of genomics and and still participated in the research studies to try to further them along and pick it take full advantage of them Robin Odom and Heather Hughes are both helping me out with the BRE work these are clinical epidemia or critical microbiologist who in addition to providing endless insight also let me do experiments in their lab as a computational person which is very bold it's our sequencing center and the Pratt fellowship on in my postdoc and NIH and my first shoutout to Michigan which is exciting and thank you so much for coming in and listening so thanks heaven owes really fascinating work I guess someone asked the first couple questions here so you kind of inferred this on your towards the end here on the slides but on the on your directed graph did you ever go back and incorporate the what rooms individual was in the only lemme that kind of as tiebreakers between the trees yeah that's exactly what we did just make sense I mean we're able to resolve at her yeah I think I think what would mean about that was seeing what didn't make sense seeing what what couldn't still be explained when incorporating that and then inferring that there must have been a more complicated epidemiological scenario that kind of is counter to how we're assuming that transmissions are happening so so when genetics is clearly telling you something that we have no epidemiology understanding we went back and looked at the specific transmissions in particular and were able to learn interesting things cool and and my second question I was looking at that graph and I realized there's probably many many factors age immune compromised whatnot but I was just thinking in terms of survival if you were to overlay that on that graph if there were any particular mutations that maybe made the bacteria even more resistant or morphogenetic or yeah so obviously for the study we don't care about phenotype I thought there's markers but there are definitely antibiotic resistance mutations that we see in the course of the outbreak and that's just obviously the phenotype where when the strain came into that clinical Center there were three drug that was acceptable to gentamicin pegasi clean and khlyst in which I mentioned earlier during the course of that outbreak resistance about all three of those drugs essentially again leave the pan drug resistance and those mutations are in no genome other than resistance it's really difficult to infer a team is in ruins or things that could affect patient outcome but you would expect that over the long term those mutations are accumulating other questions I know they're definitely transportable elements there weren't transportable elements movements during the course of the outbreak there were transportable element movements in Acinetobacter isolates over time and patients were in one of the patients that had a PM RB mutation we also saw an insertion sequence drum rut jump right upstream of the PMR operon tell probably further amplify expression from the locus but there's definitely multiple mechanisms evolution other than single nucleotide variants so that the that's a really good observation [Music] yeah yeah so they essentially created a cohort unit so you specific for her club dealer colonized patients or anyone who had been colonized and they resided there for the duration of the outbreak and then they would periodically do full hospital likto samantha culturing to identify any potentially silently colonized patient and that was really the key to finding these soundly colonized patients so you can ensure that it was out of the hospital I would say but like around 200 yeah so it was no small task and again I think a point I would waste earlier there are resources there that aren't necessarily available so this is something that Tara Eponine all this decided needed to be done and it was done and and in terms of bringing other molecular assays into the critical micro lab they can just do it that sort of thing and necessary trivial to do to do anywhere [Music] and I'm engaging in some collaborations now with people who are interested in in long-term care facilities so these are facilities that have very sick patients they're on ventilators but there and they typically go back and forth between hospitals so there's really good infection control in hospital both up to these places and and the idea that these long-term care facilities could be kind of epi centers that are seating infections in hospitals and there's been some really crazy papers showing that the colonization rate in some of these long-term health care facilities is upwards of 30 and 40% with kpc Klebsiella so like shocking and to really get a control of this problem requires you know the entire healthcare system to be explored not just acute care hospitals all right okay thank you for money Kevin again [Applause] [Music]
