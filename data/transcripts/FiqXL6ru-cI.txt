about your seminar today titled mechanics mechanistic modeling of immune cell activation in cancer so welcome and please take away oh we cannot hear you of course yes that would only be appropriate okay so thank you for the invitation and the introduction i'm excited to tell you about my research um and to have this chance to share our work with uh with the department in computational medicine and bioinformatics um so i've been focusing on over the last four or five years of being able to develop mechanistic models of immune cell activation in the context of cancer and this is really situated in a larger field called mathematical oncology where we're using mathematical models and computational tools to probe the complexities of cancer we can all agree that cancer is quite complex it involves a number of different cell types of course the disease cells are there immune cells and other stromal elements it involves different processes and here i'm just highlighting angiogenesis the formation of new blood vessels and it involves these cells interactions and processes that happen over different length scales and time scales and so having a quantitative understanding of the tuber micro environment can be quite useful in understanding the response to treatment and just gaining a more deeper view of tumor growth so the goal of my research lab is to be able to predict the dynamics of biochemical reaction networks this stems from my training as a chemical engineer and we want to do this understand the dynamics in order to help develop new drug treatments but also just to understand the effects of existing treatment strategies and to do this we're applying systems biology tools so studying the whole system rather than individual parts by combining mathematical modeling and experimental studies although we really rely quite heavily on some fantastic collaborators for experimental data and experimental validation of our models so i'll get started by you know just motivating even further the need to explore immune cells and other cells within the tumor microenvironment because there are lots of different interactions between cell populations so certainly between tumor and immune cells for example how t cells can mediate tumor cell killing how tumor cells can lead to exhaustion of t cells interactions between tumor cells and stromal cells so for example tumor cells secreting a protein called vegf that can promote the formation of new blood vessels by activating endothelial cells and then also interactions between different immune cell subpopulations such as t cells influencing the differentiation of naive macrophages into different cell states and so in my lab we're really trying to apply mechanistic and data-driven modeling to understand cell signaling predict tumor growth and ultimately explore treatment strategies so today i'll talk to you and tell you this tale of three scales uh all focused on immune cell activation and the first scale is intracellular so we want to look at signaling that's happening inside of car engineered t cells and then we build up to a cellular scale by looking at a heterogeneous population of car engineered t cells and then we sort of switch gears to look at the tissue scale and interactions between cells in the tumor micro environment and i'll have a stop here between the cellular and tissue scale if there are questions but happy to also take questions at the end so when we say cars we i mean chimeric antigen receptors you've probably heard of them you're quite excited about this type of immune immunotherapy and cars are engineered receptors that can be expressed on the surface of immune cells such as t cells or natural killer cells and it leads to the binding and recognition of a tumor-associated antigen that's presented on the surface of tumor cells and that can lead to activation of the signaling cascades inside of the immune cell and leading to secretion of cytokines and other cytotoxic factors that can target and kill the tumor cell and this recognition and binding is made possible because the extracellular domain of the car is derived from an antibody that's specific to the antigen of interest that extracellular domain is combined with intracellular signaling domains that are derived from the endogenous t cell receptors so really trying to mimic what's happening inside of the body naturally and we know that cars have been very effective lots of enthusiasm about this particularly for b-cell lymphoma fda approved therapies for this type of disease and it can be even leading to complete remission in patients but there still can be some serious side effects that happen when t cell activation goes awry and some of those are motivating factors for just having a more fundamental understanding of the signaling one is called cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome this is an over activation of the immune system that's thought to occur because the engineered receptors do not have the same control mechanisms that are present in the endogenous t cell receptor and this can lead to a flooding of the body with cytokines very harmful or even fatal to patients another limitation arises when trying to adapt the therapy to other kinds of cancers so uh in the case where it has been very effective b cell lymphoma the antigen is called cd19 and that is exclusively expressed on diseased cells and that same level of specificity is not present in other kinds of cancers so for example in solid tumors such as breast cancer we know that sub some subtypes have a high expression of her tooth but that receptor can also be expressed in healthy tissues and so the the car can have on target so it's targeting the right antigen but off tumor effects which can also lead to serious side effects for the patient so what's being done to address some of these limitations well having additional co-stimulatory domains on the car to better control the signal is one strategy another is to separate out the car to be able to target multiple molecules where the combination of that molecule of those molecules is really only present on tumor cells to address that second limitation or combining these together so having multiple targets and better control of the signal for example through chimeric inhibitory receptors such as pd1 or ctla for others but all of these have really been pursued in a guess and check or trial and error approach and there's no sort of fundamental understanding about the signaling that's at activated inside of t cells and trying to harness that understanding for better design of cars and so we feel that this is a nice place where systems biology approaches could be brought to bear to better understand the activation of car engineered t cells and ultimately in the future maybe help design more efficient and effective cars so this work that i'll first talk to you about at the intracellular scale building a mechanistic model of car t cell activation was pioneered in my lab by jennifer roars my very first phd student who finished a few years ago and she helped us to build this mechanistic model and so what we're simulating here is a second generation car this is one of the fda approved uh designs for b-cell lymphoma it targets cd19 it has this cb28 co-stimulatory domain with a few different phosphorylation sites that we need to keep track of as well as the cd3 zeta domain that's also present in endogenous t cell receptors which is comprised of three immunotyrosine activating motifs or itams each of which has two phosphorylation sites that we need to track an important species here is the kinase that sort of gets everything going and this is called lck lymphocyte kinase it undergoes autophosphorylation as well as mediating the phosphorylation of different sites on the car and once two sites on an item are phosphorylated then another protein called sap70 comes in and binds and uh lck can also mediate phosphorylation of zaps enemy now all the while that these activating these phosphorylation events are occurring the cell is also recruiting phosphatases and so this is a negative feedback loop where ship one of phosphate case can attenuate the signal mediate the removal of those phosphate groups but given strong and durable binding of the antigen to the extracellular domain the cell can overcome that negative feedback and ultimately signal through this multi-protein complex called the lat signalism so lat is a scaffolding protein that allows lots of other proteins to come together in this multi-protein complex and then ultimately signals through the map k pathway leading to activation of earth and so we know earth is a transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation in a number of different types of type of cell and er also provides some positive feedback because it mediates phosphorylation of lck at a protection site that inhibits this action of the phosphatase shift one and then we can also think about ways in which the co-stimulatory domain cd28 would enhance or modify or affect the signaling through the map k pathway so we have two adapter proteins grb2 and gads that can influence cd28 signaling through this particular pathway now this is an overview it's actually a simplified schematic of the mathematical model because it doesn't show all the bimolecular interactions and then leading to the formation of these different signaling complexes and we can already see that there's positive feedback there's negative feedback and so it's not clear how changing the structure of the car for example removing an item or mutating one of these phosphorylation sites or taking out altogether the cd28 stimulatory domain how that would change signaling through the transcription factor and so that's what we want to accomplish with this mathematical model is to answer questions about what is the signaling what are the signaling dynamics and how are they influenced by the design of the car the car structure so to do this we use mathematical modeling and we're using bionetgen which is a rule-based modeling platform that allows us to automatically generate the reaction network and so the way that this is done is that we define based on biological information we define uh biological rules biochemical rules for example gads can bind to this particular site on cd28 and that interaction happens independently of what's happening on the car so whether it's fully phosphorylated or not or whether step 70 is bound at one or more of the the itams or not and so we define these the small subset of rules and then bionetgen allows us to automatically generate all the different permutations of those rules and ultimately gives us a set of ordinary differential equations that describe how the species concentrations evolve over time and of course within a model we have parameter values so any value of that we have in the model that's not already measured experimentally we need to estimate its uh its numerical value and so to do this we use a fitting algorithm called particle swarm optimization that allows us to match the model outputs to the experimental data and in the process of doing that estimate what the optimal parameter value should be so what did we first try to accomplish with this mathematical model well we've got very i think we started out being very ambitious and said okay let's use this pretty large model that we get from bionetgen my student jennifer collected some experimental data using flow cytometry to see the level of phosphorylation of zab 70 or slp 76 or other species in the signaling network and we try to fit those flow cytometry measurements and that failed pretty miserably there's just too much uncertainty um in the model fits not enough data to really calibrate the model uh very well and so we took another approach then which is a bottom-up approach so putting together different sub modules of this larger network uh calibrating those sub modules uh very closely to experimental data and then combining them together so i'll talk very briefly about the first sub module that we looked at which is how lck becomes catalytically active and of course this is important because it mediates downstream signaling but lck is having its own program by which it becomes catalytically active that depends on the inhibitory kinase csk and the phosphatase cd45 and so we found some data in the literature from ronald vales group at ucsf we fit that data to with our model and we were able to predict the catalytic activity of lck in its different forms monomeric forms as well as dimer forms and we used that model to also predict and explain how its catalytic activity is controlled over time so that was the very first model we published that a few years ago and then we started marching down the pathways so now that we could estimate what the catalytic activity of lck is then we said well what is the rate at which it mediates phosphorylation of different sites on the car and so here my student again performed experiments and modeling to be able to understand lck mediated phosphorylation of the car so the experimental system that she used is um implemented we took it from the the work of ronald vale where they put together this liposomal membrane system that's meant to mimic the t cell membrane environment we can express different proteins on the membrane including lck or different car constructs add atp for defined periods of time and then quantify with phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry the amount of phosphorylation of the different sites on the car and so i'll show you the experimental data that my student collected the circles are experimental measurements the lines are our fit our model fit to the data and so what i'm plotting is the amount of phosphorylation the relative amount of phosphorylation as a function of time and the time is on the log scale and this is the amount of phosphorylation of the six different sites on cd3 zeta and this is a case where the car that we expressed on the liposomal membrane only has cd3 zeta domain there okay so we can see uh the different time courses that she collected for the six different sites we had a very nice fit to the mod to the experimental data and were able to match the model to the data and extract the parameter values we did a few uh just checks to confirm that the model does indeed match experimental measurements or at least experimentally calculated values so we took just the experimental data again those are the circles here and asked the question about what the time would be for the amount of phosphorylation to reach 50 so the half maximal time and the circles are what we would calculate just by using the experimental data the bars are what we would predict with our mathematical model and again we have a nice agreement between model and experiments and then we also looked at uh cooperativity so we asked the question if the phosphorylation at the six different sites is interacting at all or if the phosphorylation is happening independently at each of the sites and the hill coefficient is a way to understand that behavior where if the hill coefficient is right around one then it means that the sites are operating independently of one another again we can extract that hill coefficient based on experimental measurements and those are the circles here or we can predict what would happen with our mathematical model and those are the bars again seeing a very nice match between modeling and experiments and so this is for a car that has just cd3 zeta and then we took it a step further to say well what happens to the amount of phosphorylation if the car now also has the cd-28 co-stimulatory domain and so these are the experimental measurements that my student collected the circles here the lines are again a model fit to those data and hopefully what you could see is that the circles and our model fit shift to the left which means that the presence of cd28 co-stimulatory domain on the car enhances or speeds up the rate at which lck is able to mediate phosphorylation of the cd3 zeta sites so the presence of cd28 enhances phosphorylation of cd3 zeta and we could see that clearly with the experimental data and our model fit we can also see that clearly with the estimated parameter values where the k-cat value here tells us the catalytic rate of lck mediating phosphorylation where in the black hash bar it's for the case where cd28 is not present so the car that only has cd3 zeta or with the gray bar with the car that has cd28 and cd3 status so we see a three-fold increase in the catalytic rate of lck gin also performs some point mutations to convert the tyrosine sites to phenylalanine in order to see what are the important or what are the effects of these different sites on cd28 but the takeaway message from here is that the presence of cd28 increases the rate at which the sites on cd3 zeta are phosphorylated and perhaps an explanation of this is really just a physical interaction so having cd28 there allows lck to come in closer proximity to the cd3 zeta sites and can promote phosphorylation at those sites so i talked to you about already this first sub model about lck phosphorylation and activation also the seconds of model spent a little bit more time on that to look at how lck now mediates phosphorylation of different sites on the car we can combine that with canonical models of negative feedback that happen in uh endogenous t-cell receptor signaling as well as canonical models for map k and erk phosphorylation along with a new component for the formation of the last single zone and here it sort of illustrates even more clearly the modular approach that we took but now with this full model we cannot only look at phosphorylation of the car or of these individual species but downstream activation specifically focusing on er phosphorylation we know that it's a transcription factor it promotes cell proliferation it's shown to be important in endogenous t cell receptor signaling and so we wanted to look at the dynamics of earth phosphorylation in the context of car signaling so we asked this question what is the role of cd28 in that co-stimulatory domain in activating downstream er so how we answer that question is to use our mathematical model to make some new predictions so we incorporated three different hypotheses as to how cd 28 could affect downstream signaling leading to earth phosphorylation so the first two are what i mentioned earlier about how it acts there are different adapter proteins grb2 or gads that can bind to cd-28 and in different ways either through the lat signalosome or directly through sos leading to or phosphorylation uh could affect irk and the third hypothesis that we incorporated is from sub model 2 that i just described to you that tells us that the presence of cd28 enhances the rate at which lck mediates phosphorylation of cd3 zeta sites so we incorporated each of these three hypotheses into our mathematical model individually we also did them in pairs uh i won't show that here but what we then predicted is the arc response time this is the amount of time that it takes for half of irk inside of the cells to become doubly phosphorylated this is a characteristic feature that's also used to understand cell activation in endogenous t cell receptor signaling so we wanted to look at this for car signaling as well so what i'm plotting in the blue is the case where the car has just cd3 zeta or in the red dash line the case where the car has cd3 zeta along with cd28 either for grb2 binding only for gas binding or for the enhancement of the cd3 zeta kinetics and then i'm showing the earth response time as a function of antigen concentration so how much stimulation the simulated cells are being exposed to and we see that for grb2 binding or gads binding it has a very similar shape and very similar results where having cd28 there actually slows down the response and we see that because this red curve is above the blue curve so it has longer time it takes longer time to reach the same level of phosphorylation of earth and that's in stark comparison to the case where we look at um the presence of cd28 enhancing cd3 zeta phosphorylation kinetics where here the red dashed line is below the blue curve for all of the antigen concentrations that we consider and so it's the models predicting that the presence of cd28 is speeding up the earth response time making it shorter so these are all model predictions novel predictions and we wanted to test and validate which one would be correct and so jyn performed more experiments where she engineered jerkat t cells to express either a car that only has cd3 zeta or a car that has cd3 zeta and cd28 she also engineered k562 cells so those would be the target cell that then would now express uh cd19 and then she combined these two cell types in different ratios in order to change the amount of stimulation that the engineered car t cells would ex would receive and then she measured with flow cytometry the irk response time so these are the data that she collected again showing the results for cd3 zeta only car or the car that has cd3 zeta along with cd28 and you can see that for all the different car to target cell ratios there's a clear difference between the two different cars and then also the presence of cd28 looks to speed up the er response time so just to remind you this is what our model predicted so there's a really nice a qualitative validation of the model predictions now you might be scratching your head and raising your eyebrow about why there's a difference in the magnitude of the earth response time so maybe even an order of magnitude or several fold higher and uh we think that it's because the model doesn't capture those physical interactions that we see with the the two uh cell types and so we're not capturing that and maybe that's why we have are predicting a slightly longer work response time but certainly right the experimental results look closer to this model prediction compared to what we would predict for just grb two binding or gads binding so the takeaway message here is that we have this mechanistic model that can explain the effect of cd-28 how it influences t-cell activation with a focus on the level of phosphorylation of irk so then we said well that's nice right we can understand what's happening inside of an average cell or a single cell but can we look at what's happening on the population level and why is this important it's important because when we think about this type of immunotherapy it's called adoptive t cell therapy where the patient's own t cells are harvested they're engineered outside of the patient's body to now express the car and then this population of car engineered t cells is provided back to the patient and so there's necessarily going to be some heterogeneity in that cell population and we wanted to ask the question of how does that influence overall the response at the population level and so a current student in the lab colin s started to work on this to simulate a heterogeneous population of car engineered t cells and where is the heterogeneity coming from well he varied the initial concentrations of the signaling species that's one form of cell to cell heterogeneity the initial starting amounts of these species and then simulated the model so we ran a simulation for 100 000 cells each cell having a different uh starting concentration where we just drew from a gamma distribution for the initial concentrations over a defined range again taking the range and the distribution from experimental literature and then simulated this population of cells so i'll just show you a representative sample of 100 cells not all 100 000 and what i'm showing is the amount of phosphorylation of er as a function of time and so you can see even with this sample of 100 cells that there is a lot of variability so there are some cells that have this curve that reaches 100 phosphorylation of erg very rapidly within just a couple of minutes other cells do also reach 100 phosphorylation but it takes uh several fold longer and then some cells never reach 100 phosphorylation and so what we wanted to do is just to understand what is influencing this variability and first classify the final response of er as either being low or high low meaning it has less than 50 phosphorylation higher meaning the amount of phosphorylation of urc at 15 minutes is greater than 50 percent and just a little bit of motivation about why we have this binary classification it's just we can look here at the distribution of the irk response for our 100 000 cells you can clearly see this by modality where 90 of the cells either have a very high level of phosphorylation or or low phosphorylation alert and this is also seen in endogenous t cell receptor signaling as well where an analog signal of changing the amount of uh the stimulation that the cells receives receive leads to um a digital response either on or off for er so it's already known to occur in endogenous t-cell receptor signaling we see it also here in car stimuli so the question becomes how can we separate the low and high uh responding erg cells just based on the initial concentrations right that's the only level of heterogeneity that we incorporated into the model we changed the initial concentrations across this population of 100 000 cells can we now relate our inputs the initial concentrations to the outputs and the way that we did this is using partial least squares regression or i like to just call this machine learning light but it's just regression analysis to relate the inputs to the outputs and so one part of plsr is to initially do a principal component analysis where we're just trying to make sure that we can indeed separate out these two populations now there is some overlap here right in the center but we can clearly see two clouds one with the low earth responding cells and one with the higher corresponding cells mainly in this first dimension this first component which captures about 90 percent of the variability in our simulated data so then we said we can separate out the populations for high and low can we now predict which of the inputs which of the initial concentrations most strongly influence that classification and so part of plsr is to get out what's called the variable importance of projection score or vip score and it asks allows us to answer this question about which initial concentrations influence the er response and so i've just highlighted um the initial concentrations that have a vip score greater than one which is a good rule of thumb to use to say that that input significantly influences the output and so we can see here cd3 zeta is important lck is important and then also some species in the map k pathway but this just tells us which species are important we can go further and see how are they important one note here is that the initial amount of erc is not a predictor about whether the response will be high or low so it doesn't really matter how much er the cells start out with it doesn't um influence the final high or low classification of the irk response so with moving forward and looking at the weight so this tells us how influential these species are and what direction the initial concentrations would pull the final response we can answer this question about how do the initial concentrations influence the irk response so i've darkened the bars that have a vip score greater than one and then i've color coded them all to say if the color is blue that means that increasing the concentration of that species shifts the cells towards having a higher irk response if it's red then increasing the concentration of that species shifts the cell towards having a lower earth response so some of these make really perfect sense right increasing the amount of lck that kinase uh would lead the cells towards having a higher erc response another thing that makes sense increasing the amount of the phosphatases shifts the cells towards having a lower response phosphatase ship one but what we were not clear about is the prediction for cd3 zeta where it has a red bar which means that increasing the expression of cd3 zeta in the car would actually lead the cells towards having a lower er response and so we wanted to understand this prediction and try to explain why it's coming out of our analysis and so to do that we turned back to our mechanistic model the ode model and said well what happens if we vary the amount of cd3 zeta and go from a very low amount of 50 micromolar all the way up to 5000 micromolar so we can clearly see that it shifts the cells towards having a slower earth response but at the same time it increases the amount of the phosphatase so this is the way in which um changing the er or sorry changing the cd3 zeta expression actually recruits more of the phosphatases to attenuate the signal and that's how increasing uh cd3 zeta expression actually leads to a lower earth response so the model helps us to explain this maybe um counter-intuitive or non-intuitive prediction that having too much activation of cell signaling meaning too much expression of the car can actually have unintended effects by actually reducing the final level of er phosphorylation so just to summarize these two scales that i presented so far intracellular and cellular we have constructed a mechanistic model of car t-cell activation the model helps us to explain how different car constructs namely the car that has cd3 zeta alone or cd3 zeta in combination with the co-stimulatory domain called cd28 how those two different cars would influence t cell signaling and cell activation and then we combined the mechanistic model the ode model with the data-driven approach to identify the influential model inputs and by doing that combination of mechanistic and data-driven modeling we can gain better insight into how to modulate the cell response so just as an example maybe there is a certain level of erg phosphorylation or really um a time scale over which we would like to see the earth become fully phosphorylated we can use this combination of modeling approaches to say well which protein should we overexpress or which protein expression should be reduced in order to achieve that desired response so we learned a lot from intracellular and cellular scales we next wanted to move up to the tissue scale and here we're interested in modeling the tumor immune ecosystem so now not just what's happening inside of immune cells but how does the immune cell activation influence the growth of the tumor and so you can see that we're actually building up across scales because we can look at intracellular signaling embed that into a cell and then look at how cells interact with one another and lead to the growth of the tumor tumor mass so here we're moving away from ode modeling and instead focusing on what's called agent-based modeling which allows us to study these interactions between cells and also predict the response to treatment so and this is a work that colin has continued to to move forward in the lab so um the kind of model that we're looking at is agent-based model this means that we are focusing on individual agents the agents or the entities are six different cell types so we have tumor cells we have inactive and active t cells and then we have three forms of macrophages and i'll come back to this in a couple of slides we also have on top of just looking at individual cells we can also predict the concentrations of diffusible factors proteins or in this case cytokines called il4 and interferon gamma and their concentrations and distribution in this 2d space is described by partial differential equations so just to give a little bit more insight into the model structure we have these different entities so t cells can mediate tumor cell killing once the t cell and the tumor cell come into contact with one another and the t cell becomes activated then it can promote tumor cell killing macrophages one form of macrophages that are called m1 macrophages enhance t cell mediated tumor cell killing so m1 macrophages are anti-tumor and on the other hand m2 macrophages are pro tumors so they inhibit um tumor cell killing and t cells secrete a cytokine called interfering gamma that promotes the differentiation of macrophages from a naive state into the m1 state and tumor cells and macrophages m2 macrophages secrete another protein called il4 that promotes differentiation of naive macrophages into the m2 state so this shows the kinds of cell cell interactions that we have right direct like interactions between the cells or interactions that are mediated by the different cytokines that we have in the model and just to also give you a little bit of insight into that other aspect of the partial differential equations so we want to know how much of the cytokines are present and where are they present and so we can solve we can understand that by solving the partial differential equations uh and so i'm just illustrating that here with the yellow color where il4 is secreted by tumor cells and macrophages and so it might have a higher concentration here in the center and then it can diffuse away and you can see lighter colors of yellow indicating lower concentrations here in the periphery so one other aspect of the model itself that i wanted to talk about is how we're incorporating intracellular signaling again building up across scales and so there's a nice model that was published a night in 2019 that looked at signaling pathways that influence or mediate macrophage differentiation and it tells us how a naive macrophage becomes activated and goes towards an m2 or an m1 phenotype and so we wanted to incorporate that kind of level of detail into the model so that the behavior of macrophages and whether they become m2 or m1 is directly informed by this intracellular signaling and so just to show you this is a toy model but what we could do is take a model like what zao published it's an ode based model we could simulate the model hundreds of thousands of times basically doing monte carlo simulations with different concentrations of the inputs to the model and get a range of different model predictions that gives us the simulated data set and we take as the output from that data set whether the cell the macrophage would go towards an m2 or an m1 phenotype and that decision is made based on the area under the curve of the signaling species that promote m2 relative to the sum of the area of the under the curve for the signaling species that promote uh differentiation towards m1 so really it's this m2 m1 score if it's greater than one then the cell will go towards m2 otherwise it's m1 and so we get this categorical output to our simulated data again having run it hundreds of thousands of times with different uh input values and then we encode the simulated data using a neural network so that we can say given an input what would the response be whether the cell would go towards m1 or m2 and then we embed that neural network inside of each of our macrophage agents so that given the amount of io4 that the cell experiences in its local micro environment or interfering gamma it would be processed through this neural network and then go towards an m2 or an m1 phenotype okay so this is how we can incorporate an intracellular program that drives the cell behavior and running the ode model outside of the agent-based model and then encoding it with a neural network allows us to greatly speed up our computations instead of having a the full ode model inside of each macrophage so i've talked a lot about the model what did we apply it to do what kinds of questions can we answer we can look at the cells dynamics over time we can also look at the effects of different immunotherapies so starting with the cells dynamics actually just a snapshot in time we can see the distribution of cells in our 2d micro environment where we have a mass of tumor cells here lots of inactive t cells um a few um active t cells around the periphery of the tumor those are shown in red and then a lot of m2 macrophages as well but we can also look at the time courses and so because agent-based models are probabilistic this means that every time we run the model we could get slightly different results because there's a probability that a cell would undergo a certain behavior at any time and so we ran the model 100 times in order to try to extract what the general conclusions are so out of those 100 times 99 of them show that the number of cancer cells this is without any treatment would be controlled just by the endogenous immune population and just one out of 100 and that that's the one i'm showing in red is the case where the tumor population is eliminated just due to the endogenous immune cell population and this equilibrium state of the tumor cell dynamics can be thought to represent the immune control phase of tumor growth that occurs over months or years involves the selection of of tumor cells that are responsive to the immune environment but could ultimately um become resistant to the immune system and then lead to uh exponential growth again but we certainly see that in that control phase uh for m2 cells and then also for tumor cells and both the total number of tumor cells and the number of active tumor cells as well or sorry total number of t cells and active number of t cells as well so this is just the time force then we wanted to say well what happens when we simulate different therapies immunotherapies and these are all macrophage-based therapies that we decided to study with this mathematical model we can try three different strategies um taking inspiration from the literature and even phase one clinical trials where it's been um tried uh it's been pursued to deplete macrophages so get rid of all macrophages to inhibit their recruitment towards the tumor or to re-educate macrophages converting that pro-tumor macrophage m2 into an anti-tumor macrophage in one and so we tried all three of these strategies individually in order to see their efficacy in removing the tumor so one major output or prediction that we get from the model is the fraction of tumors that is removed and again we're running the model 100 times for each of these different settings and then we can say out of those 100 how many cases was there with the fret the tumor completely removed so what i'm planning is the fraction of tumor is removed this is just for the case of depleting macrophages on the x-axis is the probability that any macrophage would have of being removed from the from the stimulation and we can see that as we increase the depletion probability even just a small change can lead to a drastic increase in the efficacy of this treatment and further increases meaning mean that all the tumors would be removed we can also see how long does it take for the tumor to be removed across different depletion probabilities and as we increase the depletion probabilities up to a certain point then the time that it takes decreases we can do the same stimulations for inhibiting recruitment of macrophages or re-educating macrophages again we see that increasing the strength of the treatment would lead to an increase in the efficacy we see a very sharp increase in the case of re-educating macrophages and then in general it takes a shorter period of time to remove the tumor when we consider re-educating macrophages compared to inhibiting their recruitment or depleting macrophages altogether now along with just looking at whether the tumor is removed or not we can also look at the composition of the tumor and in particular we focused on the um pro-immune to uh pro-immune cells so the m1 cells and the active t cells and we can see how the numbers of these cell populations change depending on the treatment strategy so the takeaway message from here is that with re-educating macrophages we get a lot more m1 macrophages which is what we would expect right that's the purpose of the treatment to convert m2 to m1 and to promote the differentiation of naive macrophages in in into m1 state and so that definitely happens but a side effect a collateral effect is that we also have a larger number of active t cells so this treatment strategy is effective because it not only increases the number of anti-tumor macrophages but it also enhances activation of t cells as well and then maybe just one last set of results is to look at what happens when we cycle treatment on and off so this previous slide i showed is the case where we have continuous treatment for either depleting macrophages inhibiting their recruitment or converting m2 to m1 and then we said well what happens if we cycle on and off treatment which is relevant in the case of thinking about patient compliance or just wanting to give the smallest amount of treatment to avoid side effects and so we can turn on and off treatment for a period of time and do that either for depleting macrophages for inhibiting their recruitment or converting m2 to m1 and in the case of inhibiting recruitment we see and again the actually the colored uh boxes here the darker the color that means that the larger the fraction of tumors that is removed and so we want to see more darker boxes and in the case we're inhibiting recruitment we see a lot of white boxes which means that the treatment is not effective when we cycle it on and off and that's in comparison to depleting macrophages or re-educating macrophages and even in this case of re-educating macrophages we find that even for a long cycle so up to 25 days and when the treatment is only on for two days out of that cycle then the re-education of macrophages is still predicted to be very effective in eliminating tumors and i won't show you but we also look at again the number of m1 macrophages the number of active t cells and this is again shown to be very effective strategy for improving the immune composition of the tumor so it's shown to be very effective to re-educate macrophages both in removing tumors and doing that in a shorter period of time and improving the immune composition of the tumor so with that i will summarize this part of the talk on the tissue scale we put together a multi-scale model of tumor immune interactions we also included intracellular signaling by encoding the signaling network using a neural network we use the model to predict the dynamics of cells and also the diffusible factors the cytokines i didn't show it here but we can look at their dynamics over time as well and then we applied the model to investigate the efficacy of different immunotherapeutic strategies finding that re-educating macrophages is shown to be very effective in removing tumors and improving the tumor immune composition as well so with that i will thank the members of my lab especially jennifer roars whose work i presented in the first part of the talk and colin says who is continuing and studying the tumor immune ecosystem as well as our collaborators this is us outside of my house in may when we were celebrating the graduation of a few students over the spring also acknowledge our funding sources and thank all of you for your attention and i'm happy to take questions thank you so much dr philly for this wonderful talk so we have a larger audience today so if you have a question feel free to admit to yourself and ask a question if you are in person at our forum hope please just walk up to the podium and ask a question there hi i have a question uh this is maureen um so i i first of all it's a really awesome talk thank you i was really interested in the the last part of it because it's uh relevant to some of my research in cancer and i was wondering um what i'm basically for immunotherapy i'm uh familiar with the anti-pd1 and anti-pdl one what is the treatment that's used to re-educate the m2 to m1 so yeah it's uh in this case we were simulating okay yeah in this case we were simulating pi3 kinase inhibition so that's been shown as one strategy to um enhance differentiation towards m1 and to convert m2 to m1 there are other strategies that have also been looked at pre-clinically but this is one of those that can be used to do to perform the re-education important i remember that in that one slide you showed the il4 and the interferon gamma um is the ratio of those two genes really important in it yeah so we tried in in putting together the simulated um data set to then produce the neural network we varied il4 and interfering gamma so those were the inputs that we varied and we didn't i actually we didn't go back and look at that simulated data set very closely um to see whether it's the absolute concentrations or their relative amounts instead we mainly focused on the downstream signaling elements but that's a really great question to to dig more into um because maybe it doesn't matter so much the absolute values that's probably what i would predict but rather rather their relative concentrations yeah i was kind of wondering like could you use like i do a lot of rna-seq for gene expression data it's wondering if there's some way to use you know some function of various genes to predict the ratio of the m1 m2 and to predict which patients might be good candidates for the treatment yeah i think yeah i think it would be nice to go back even with you know running this many different times maybe with different um rates of interactions between the cells or different propensity for differentiation or tumor cell killing so incorporating more heterogeneity here and then seeing can we predict what our relationships between the final response and some of the characteristics of the cell that we could explore so that's definitely one um direction that we're taking this work is to now have this platform and it's right now it's just you know agnostic to the tumor type but importantly we need to make it specific for example to a particular cancer type and then use it to say uh can we gain any insights into which tumor micro environmental conditions or patient-specific properties would influence the response to treatment great thank you thank you other questions may i ask another question so uh so i wonder whether this model is public available like if i want to try the model to simulate anything can i maybe download from your github or how to use that yes um this model is available the second two well okay so that means that all of them so definitely the tissue scale is available on github and then for collins paper we also put the model on github which essentially is right this full model that i talked about in the first part for car mediated t-cell activation so we've been trying to be more diligent about putting everything on github for this exact purpose to provide it to the community and then also for rigor and reproduce stability as well um so this pic this model um the paper was published in 2020 and the model is available on github and it is uh in c plus plus the other model is in matlab um so if you can send us the link to this repositories we are able to update your talk information so that other people while we will attract a lot of audience online so they may be able to visit your website models okay yeah i can do that yeah i'll just say also we've expanded even since then so you know especially as you know a model developer you're always thinking about other ways to improve the model and so now it's a center-based model and it's in 3-d to better to be more realistic center-based meaning there can be overlap between cells instead of having just them on a lattice and we've also incorporated um the presence of vessels blood vessels that provide nutrients and oxygen and so that means that we're also accounting in you know very simple terms metabolism as well so there there are new features and we have another version of the model on github that has that that shows those features too i also wonder if because right now there are a lot like codex image of available for cancer tissue will this type of um single cell like spatially resolved uh imaging data be kind of give you some additional information to train or i just feel that can might be useful yes yes yes we are super excited about um some of the immuno like spatial immunoprofiling because that can give like the x y or the xyz coordinates for a particular patient's tumor or even for a mouse tumor slide and that could be the input the starting point for our simulations where it would really nicely complement the experiments because we can provide the trajectories and then also look at different immunotherapeutic or other therapeutic strategies so that's exactly what we're doing now we're collaborating with one researcher at usc who has some mouse samples for breast cancer to do this and we're taking some data published codex data and other immunofluorescence data for pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer well that's already been published in the literature so you're absolutely right that's where we're going next to try to use the data as a starting point and predict the predictions make the predictions on a patient specific level that's really cool i think we are right on time it's five o'clock our time so we are really excited thank you so much for your wonderful talk and we hope to see you again sometime in person hopefully yes that would be great thanks for hosting me i appreciate it have a nice evening bye
