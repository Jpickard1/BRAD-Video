so today we have two presenters Sneha Patil and Raymond camel Conte or are both members of my lab but this is actually a a project that I am collaborating on with LR karnovski and so are both of our labs have been working on this for quite some time some of you may be familiar with the concept to Jen which was based on genes this is I don't want to give any preconceived notions but it's somewhat similar tool but with several different a lot of differences and so you'll hear about that and so Raymond will start off with the motivation and what it's all about and then I will present some of the backend how actually works all right hello everybody thanks for coming so I'm going to be talking about concept my tab which is a way to explore relationships between sets of compounds so oh yeah thanks I tend to like mumbles so just to get it started what what is concept Mehcad it is a tool that maps tens of thousands of compounds to biological concepts that are drawn from a number of databases which many of you might be familiar with such as cake pathways enzymes gene ontology and medical subject headings and I have a little asterisks next next to the mesh terms because those are unique to concept man tab relative to other metabolite set so in addition to map mapping metabolites we also map compounds that are shown in the literature to have biological activity and so from your perspective it's a web application that you can use to explore the relationships between the sets of compounds that we've annotated so to get started just what are metabolites they're just small molecules that are in our bodies and in other organism and other organisms that are chemically transformed during the tablet and they're necessary for us to exist basically and metabolism is just the set of all of the enzyme catalyzed chemical reactions that sustain us and other organisms so it's been said that metabolites serve as direct signatures and biochemical activity and so in that sense they are easier to correlate with phenotype so they're kind of interesting in that sense and I've just provided some examples l-arginine is just a um you know I I mean no acid ATP is kind of the energy currency of our body and it's a coenzyme a is used in fatty acid biosynthesis very often so what is metabolomics it is kind of the characterization of all of the small molecule metabolites that are found in cells tissues bio fluids and organisms and it investigates the products of gene protein and environmental interactions and so it gives information that's complementary to genomics proteomics and transcript omics and so a lot of effort has been made into mapping these metabolites to biological functions and so I've just pictured kind of the hairball of KEGG pathways and this is kind of one example of annotating metabolites and compounds two biological functions so to give you a sense of what concept metabolites ascribe for you the mappings that we've done so at top are kind of our our concept types I'll call them and so we have medical subject heading terms which come from the National Library of Medicine it's a controlled vocabulary we have cake pathways which many of you are familiar with we have enzymes and then we have go terms from the gene ontology database and so I'll kind of step through how we mapped each of these kind of higher-level biological functions to eventually compounds so to start I'll tell you how we map mesh terms which comprise kind of subsets or it is comprised of subsets that are anatomical you can have chemicals and drugs you know diseases which is particularly interesting in a lot of cases organisms phenomenon processes which kind of overlaps with NGO terms you can have psychology and psychiatry and then kind of technology industry and agriculture which is kind of like environmental type stuff so in order to map mesh terms to pubchem compounds we go through a tool which was also developed here called my tab to mesh so the tab to mesh was developed by maureen and allah' and alex and basically what it does is it associates pubchem compounds with mesh terms so every pubmed so it looks through the entire pubmed article database and associated with each pubmed article is a mesh to our mesh terms and substances and those chemical substances can be linked to pubmed substances and then essentially a Fisher's exact test is done which associates whether compound occurs in a paper along with a mesh term or not and so we build our mesh term metabolite sets based on all of the compounds that are associated with a particular mission and this is kind of novel a novel annotation between compounds and mesh terms so the next database that we use is KEGG pathways and so this is actually rather straightforward because you can just get cake pathways as XML files and then contain in the XML files are just all the compounds that are in that cake pathway so this is rather straightforward the more difficult annotations to make are with enzymes and go terms and so what we end up doing is going through cake pathways and so I've kind of highlighted in this cake pathway of pyruvate metabolism kind of two compounds that are in circles and then an enzyme which is actually linked to a gene in the rectangle and so in the cake pathways these two compounds are linked by a reaction which is catalyzed by this enzyme which has a gene associated with it right so from this we can pull out that there is a gene associated with these two compounds that's kind of the first stage and then in order to relate enzymes or go terms with the genes that we've just related to the compounds we use just in our bioconductor package called or HG yes dB and then we get all of the mappings from go terms or enzymes to genes and then we can use we go through all of the cake pathways to map all possible genes to all possible compounds that they are connected to through a reaction and then from there we get all of those annotations okay and so if you kind of step back and look at all the mappings that we've done we kind of have literature based mappings which comprise all of the mesh terms and then we have pathway based mappings that are really going through Keg on the right hand side so we kind of have two types of annotations and the intersection of them can be quite interesting so after I do all after we do all the mappings we first require all the metabolites is to have more than four metabolites in them in less than 4,000 so that we have a enough statistical power and be enough biological specificity within our metabolite sets that we're comparing and so this is just a table that gives you a sense of how many concepts we have annotated per concept type right and so you'll immediately notice that the mesh terms have a lot more concepts on average and that they also need to be much bigger they have more compounds in them per concept than the NGO terms or the CAG or enzyme pathways do not only that when we look at the the mesh terms we annotate order of magnitude greater more compounds to these biological functions than we do using go or take so that's just something to keep in mind and so in the end we're gonna be interested in figuring out the relationships between all of these metabolites us that we've created and so in order to do that we're gonna look at the overlap of compounds between all the metabolite sets and so we were curious how promiscuous are compounds within the concept types essentially and in within the con the concepts so this is just all of our concept types that we have and on the x-axis we have the number of concepts that a compound belongs to on the log to scale and so what you kind of notice if you look at the mesh terms you kind of see that they are left skewed which indicates that a lot of the mesh terms have compounds that are unique to only certain concepts only unique to one concept but they also tend to belong to more concepts as well so you kind of have these mushrooms that have very unique compounds but they also have very promiscuous compounds or as if you look at the NGO terms that are kind of much more willing to share on average their con their compounds with each other so this kind of plays into the Association tests that we're gonna do so in order to write so this is just looking at what are the what are the concepts are the compounds that are most common to all of the concepts and what you'll notice in this list is a lot of energy related compounds like ATP A&P ATP and that kind of makes sense because these are kind of necessary for all of the reactions to take place in all these biological processes so it makes sense that they occur in a lot of concepts so if we're gonna look at if we're gonna be comparing metabolite sets that are based on pubchem compounds to metabolite sets that are based on cake compounds we have to have relationship between the keg and the pubchem IDs and so kind of the next thing that I'm gonna note is we need a dictionary that kind of tells us that ATP and keg which has this ID is the same thing as ATP which has a different name in pubchem but has that pubchem ID and so the idea is if well it's actually quite nice kick has an API where you can just have all of the connections between keg IDs and pubchem substance IDs which are slightly different than their compound IDs and then in the metabolite of ACE that was previously developed we are able to map the substance the substance IDs to the compound at ease so basically we have this link through keg and metabolites know which cake compounds are pubchem compounds and vice versa so that way we can do Association tests between all of our metabolite sets and so we're just going to use a modified Fisher's exact test which counts the appearance of the metabolites and two concepts a and B and so if you're going to do a Fisher's exact test it's important to know what your background set is and in this case it's just the intersection of the background sets for their respective concept types that that compounds or that the concepts are from and so we just do this FDR test or this Fisher's exact test and after we do like 300 million of them we compute the FDR because we need to account for multiples so once we do those 300 million tests between all possible pairs of metabolite sets it turns out we get like 30 million or so pairs that are FDR less than 0.05 associated with each other and so this is just a heat map that indicates the level of Association as a percentage of tests done between each pair of concept type so kind of what immediately jumps out at you is the metabolite sets that were based on keg compounds tend to be more highly associated with each other than those that are associated with the mesh terms so they kind of like cool part you'll also notice that there tends to be a lot of enrichment along the diagonal relative to the diagonal but kind of the interesting biology is kind of between the concept types so that's like a nice place to look and explore for interesting relationships right and so with that it's know-how is going to talk about how we developed all the software you don't hello everyone thank you very much I'll be talking about the software development part of the concept my table it's actually a tool which is deployed on the website okay so these are the topics I will be covering mainly a concept my table is designed or developed using rails and it has a background back-end database MySQL and we are using different charts or networks to show the data in the form of pie chart networks and heat map and lastly will be the demo so Grails we have used Grails to code main logic of concept meetups and Grails is kind of a dynamic framework for web application and it is an advanced version which is based on java spring and hibernate it is an MVC framework which encouraged the separation of concern now what is MVC framework it has like different compartments where you define the different definitions like model will have all the data object definitions view will have how the user will see the pages like JSP pages or HTML pages and the controller will have the actual application logic of the project or a tool that is kind of a link between the system and the user so that is the MVC framework in Grails why we chose graves for concept my table is it has the scaffolding feature what does the scaffolding does it analyzes the our model object and it creates the controller and views for itself just with one command so generate we'll connect will create the controller and views for your domain object so basic applications like create read update and delete these kind of different pages these will be created in just one command so that is one good advantage it allows you to do development very faster because you don't have to worry about the basic application another advantage of Grails is the plug-in system so it's like a apps you can import those apps into your tool and you can add the additional functionality into your tool so for example concept might have used when of the plug-in called export which will allow you to download the data in different file formats like CSV XML or like even Excel format so that plug-in feature is all also important for concept makeup we have used MySQL as a back-end database now the MySQL is not it doesn't have like very commercial features like other commercial software's or databases has but most of the operations we are doing on the database is going to the database and just retrieving the data most of the processing is done using rails but for that purpose MySQL was the faster one and that served the purpose along with that it's secure inexpensive and it manages memory very well we can keep both the web app and the database on the same server and that allows us the foster retrieving the record this is the overview of our tables like concepts there are like around 24,000 plus concepts which are distributed in 12 different concept types like mesh CAG as Raymond mentioned and there are like 89 thousand compounds which have either pubchem ID keg ID or both and remaining tables so basically the workflow for the concept my top system is when the user comes to the web browser based on the query of the user it will go to the concept met observer which is basically agreed and then it will go based on the query it will go to the database and it will fetch the records or data from the database and it will send it to the server and server will create the visualization pattern like a network now if user has a specific requirements like the heat map then in that case concept makeup goes to the our server creates the heat map creates a matrix and send it to the Mac server which will create the heat map for the user so this is like a general way flow how the Tool Works now we are using different visualization pattern to create our to display our data like pie chart so pie chart is basically a Google API which is a simple Java Script which you embed into your website and you load your libraries and pass your data to that library in our case we are using JSON object to pass our data and then you can customize the results using like this is the snapshot of the customization parameters you can hard code the parameters or you can give or you can change the dynamically parameters like for my case concept types changes different according to the concept we have selected so the color of the slice will change accordingly and we can change that during runtime so that is been a good advantage of pie chart that it doesn't have to be hard-coded we can change it during the runtime so this is how it looks on the website it basically shows the distribution of concept types of all the concepts which are highly enriched with the concept of interest and then you can select the database from here and click on update chart and it will update your pie chart and during the runtime next is the networks so we create basically two different types of networks in concept matter first is a star network and other is a complete network and these are created using cytoscape web so this is modeled after the popular cytoscape software but it doesn't have the plug-in architecture that sort of software which is a downloadable software has so it just a reusable components which allows you to embed that code into your HTML document and you can create the different networks it is based on flex and ActionScript not on the GRE which is a good advantage of Java flex because it doesn't depend on the Java versions or a security issue we are facing right now so and in case of concept might have no representation color are represented according to their number of compounds and the type of concept types similarly for ages they represent the significant enrichment and their thickness depend upon the number of overlapping compounds and we have used a force directed layout to display the networks so this is a simple network or a star network where the concept of interest is at the center and all the other concepts which are enriched they are around that main concept and you can change the different parameters here like p value an odd ratio here and you can change their affect you can see their effect on the network similarly for complete complete is a combination of star network plus all the enrichment relationship among the concepts so yeah okay the next and the last one education electron is a heat map so for heat map we create that in our using the heat map to function from the G plot library so basically we are creating a cluster a matrix in heat map saving it sending it to Grails and Grails creates the image based on the size of that matrix we had some problems because of the size of the matrix so we create two different views for the matrix one is the table view which is for less than 300 compound or a concept size and more than 300 will go to the image view which is a static image created by Grails the cluster is created by hierarchical clustering and we use the Euclidean mass matrix with the average linkage criteria in which rules are concept and columns are compounds so this is the simple view but the concept and compound both are less than 300 we use this table view where this image is created by our and this is created by Grails and the JavaScript so we can scroll around this table and see the different values which are presented into this into this image and another is an image view this is a static image which is a zoomable image and you can zoom in and zoom out of this image and see the results let me show you the demo part okay but it will go there right okay so this is the main web page of concept met up there it is deployed right now concept might have got met dot umich.edu there are two ways to explore a concept mecca first you can explore by concept or compounds I'll show you the first the compound so if you have particular compound in mind or you want to look for a particular compound you can start typing in the name of the compound you want to look for and it will show you all the possible names in the database you can select any one of the compound and it will show you the list of similar compounds okay so this is the display page where this is the name of that compound okay guy D and pop came I read these are connected to the K again Popkin website and also the Keck structure of that compound now if the cake ID is null then we go for app upcam structure and we show the pubchem structure this number of concept indicates - how many concept that compound belongs and it also lists all the concept below should I Oh should I just extend it okay oh but it doesn't go there okay okay now if I have to search for particular concept in this I can just start typing in here like this and it will show me the compound I want to concept I want to look for now I can go to concept page from here or I can go to the main page and type in the name of the concept I want to look for for example like this one I will select the concept and then the name of the protein oops okay so this page shows the information name and the in case of mesh it shows the tree numbers and the concept type and the number of compounds it's that concept has so if you click on this number of compounds okay so if if you click on the number of compounds it will list all the compounds that concept has along with their pubchem and cake IDs and you can also download the results using this one after ok and the order there is that just a random order is the order based on the strength of the Association for the compounds is just order right you can adjust the different parameters like p-values and odds ratio here and that will change the pie chart which is displayed here for example this so this will update the pie chart down below and it will also update the list of the concept types which that concept belongs to or concept of interest is enriched with so you can select any one of the concept type or select all the concept type and go to the different views which are available here next are Network complete or a heatmap table so this is the network which is created when you click on the star network where the protein of interest or concept of interest is at the center now something about the unfolded protein response it is the well-known cellular response which is which occurs during the time of stress and it has been identified that it is connected with the plasmic reticulum stress and if you see that you can easily identify that and here like this and it is also connected with the cell depth which is this so you can identify the relationship which are which are actually published or which are already linked or established with the help of star networks now what this star network has is this concept or the node represents the concept when you click on that it will show you the information of that concept like what is the name what is the concept ID and how many compounds it has the size of this node changes according to the number of compounds it has for example like diet hi fact it has less compounds as compared to the cell death that's why the size is smaller similarly the edge edge thickness depends upon the number of overlapping compounds so if you click on the one off the edge looks like it's a bigger one okay so 16 it it will show you what compounds are making that instance section and what what are their pop came and keg IDs you can zoom in and zoom out this and even the move network around and this is using cytoscape where you can also change the different parameters here and see the effect of that parameter on your network from here you can go to complete network to see the results which will have the star at work plus other enrichment associations and this is similar to the star Network the node are represented by concepts and edges are overlap and then yeah so this is the subset superset relationship between the concept if one concept has one concept has a compound which are belongs to the other concept also like that is a subset of that concept so that is the subset superset relationship the indicate the arrow in decay which one is the superset and the other end is the subset you can go to the table view from here which will list all a concept along with the link to see which are the overlapping compounds for example this one you can see different compounds which are there and you can also download it from here you can go to the heat map to see the results this is a general overview of how a hit map will look and if you want to see the detailed structure off the heat map you can click on this one but after that there will be different views depending upon the concept and to compound matrix if it is a smaller matrix it will go to the table view and if it is a larger matrix it will go to the image view so this is the table view and here is the table which you can scroll down and up and see the results for any way to export that for the table we have the uncluttered file which is at the start of the page but not that this table you can download the image but not the table right now okay so here is the link to download that file which you can cluster it into are okay let me show you the imagery also for the I need to add some concept for the larger matrix for example oops I guess yeah you can update the charge sorry I forgot to mention that and you can go to the heat map the heat maps are little slower because it involves going to the are coming back from the are and creating it image okay so this is a static image which is created using our graves and you can zoom and this image or like if you want to look for this part you can zoom in this image and see which are the compounds and concepts are connected so this is heat maps okay okay so this is the future development we are trying to add the experimental data into the concept at our website and if you have any suggestions this windows won't work now okay if you have any questions yeah we were thinking about adding metabolite sets that were based on chemical similarity also so if M doesn't really come void say cost of footings right so if you think about reactor maybe or other databases well K is you know the most commonly used database you know guess we didn't do a thorough comparison but yeah I think think annotates the most metabolites one time even as you saw with keg it's only annotating a couple thousands compounds whereas with mesh we got more than an order magnitude more than that and I mean I think someone will bring and correct me if I'm wrong but I think some of the tools that you've mentioned at the beginning the dues is sort of saying look at other databases like reactant for example for sure I think they're mostly redundant with care so it's a good suggestion and we should probably look at it but so you know seems like a good place to start yeah and we didn't want too many redundant yeah pathways but mesh is really the the novel part of this because the other related applications and while nothing is really like this with exploration but did you mention the like MSE a No there yeah there there are a few programs that we'll try and do metabolite enrichment with experimental data but so few metabolites are annotated anywhere and them that's a lot of times they don't give you any real results so what we're trying to do with mesh this trying to get a much larger percent of metabolites to be annotated somewhere
