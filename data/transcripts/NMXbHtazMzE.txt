to give a brief introduction so um this is Oxford so the top picture is the red click camera it's a beautiful Town beautiful city it's a University Town a university city and the bottom picture is my college actually the Hartford College um so Oxford nanopo was founded in 2005 as a spin out comparing of the University of Oxford uh at the moment it's a headquarters in Oxford um and we have sites and labs and offices in Cambridge New York Boston San Francisco Japan China and all over the Europe we have about 1100 people at the moment including um biological scientists informaticians manufacturing commercial people and in September 2021 we did an IPO in London Stock Exchange and it was one of the most successful biotech IPO in London Stock Exchange we do work with quite a lot of academic institution and one of our main strengths is actually our long-term IP strategy uh we have about 1400 uh issued patents or patent applications um so we work with academic collaborators we license the IEP and we use those Technologies to improve our chemistry actually we have a license from IP from University of Michigan as well so to going to DNA sequencing so as we know like DNA is the source code of life whether it is a soil sample or virus or bacteria mammal human or crop uh any living organism has DNA so depending on the organism the size of the genome varies for E coli it's about um 4.6 million bases for human it's about 30 billion bases and some crops like the you have 17 billion bases but by reading these basis and understanding what this DNA is you can understand about the organism what is it what's in this organism is it changing is it responding to different different drugs for example is it healthy deceased and if it is deceased what is the disease is it harmful and so on so our motto at Oxford nanopo is to enable the analysis of anything by anyone anywhere but to do that we develop technology we develop a single molecule analyzing platform and that platform is based on nanopo sensing so nanopore sensing is is all technique this is a kind of electrochemistry 101 so in the left hand panel as you can see if there is a two compartment of Soul Solutions and if there's a partition and you put two electrodes and connected by a wire like a battery you can create conductivity between these two electrodes and then if you um if you paint so if you put a hole in the in the middle of the partition then you can see um electricity going through but if you seal the hole with a lipid by layer then you see you stop passing the current through so then what we do is we put this little biological nanopose into the solution and they will go and punch a hole in this membrane and then you can see again electricity is passing through this hole and this electricity you can this current you can measure using um this electric equipment so on the right hand side panel you can see the number one is when there is no block in the nanopo so you can see the current is passing through and you can see the OpenFlow current level and in panel two um when there is a molecule blocking this um blocking this channel you will see the Block in the current signal underneath so it's like a water flowing through a pipe if you block the pipe with the molecule with something some objective object it will block the passage of um water and then depending on the size of the the block you will see different uh signature different blocking patterns and this changes with the um the size of the molecule as well as the other properties like charge and so on so this is the basic principle of nanopo sensing and then two professors Professor Dan Brenton from Harvard uh on the left and then Daniel Brenton from um David Dima from UCSC thought that this can be this uh method can be used for DNA sequencing so in 1989 this is the The Notebook of David Dima he wrote down uh thinking that this might be a possible way to sequence DNA so if you pass a DNA strand through uh these tiny holes and measure the current signature you might see a difference between uh between the bases so then two years so two years later when uh professor rent and visitor visited UCSC they have discussed this and they have started some work and then Professor Mark Ackerson joined the team uh sometime later he developed uh some motor proteins that you can control the movement of the DNA through the pore and then Professor Hagan Bailey from Oxford um uh in the meantime develop all these nanopost and nanopo engineering and then this team put all these things together to develop this nanopore sensing technology and then Hagen Bailey started the company in 2005 with our CEO Gordon sangira and Spike Wilcox our chief business officer so in nanopo sequencing this is the uh this is how it works so we have um polymeric membrane that we synthesize it's a very stable polymeric membrane it's a tribe uh copolymeric membrane with three components and then we use a heavily engineered biological nanopo so we put the PO in the membrane to make a hole and then we use a motor protein which is shown in purple which is an enzyme to unwind the double standard DNA so one strand pass through and the other strand goes away and when this uh strand pass through the pole it uh disturbs the iron Passage through this Channel and this disturbance of our passage we measure as current using uh the platform that we develop so um we then underneath you can see uh different uh chips or what we call different flow cells depending on the platform you use you can use these different flow cells with different capabilities the smallest one has 126 channels and the middle one is the mid 9 flow cell which has 512 channels and the largest one has three thousand channels so all these channels then we put in a chip and in each Channel we have a single molecule of this biological protein and we can measure these current passing through the pore in a very kind of Multiplex way and each channel is individually addressable using its own electrode so you can stop one channel uh and work with the other for example um so this is uh our range of platforms the largest one is called Promethean it's a very high-end uh platform developed for um kind of population genetic sort of human genetics uh sort of applications next one is the uh the grid Diane grid dionys um is still uh have a huge capacity but not as much as um uh the Promethean and then smaller ones the the middle one is the minion and the range of process that we use for uh minhan uh so we have different platforms uh suitable for different applications so a scientist can choose depending on the experiment depending on the application which platform to use so uh some of our this is what we are developing at the moment so we are changing our uh Min line so this is actually uh the minion that we develop uh so it's a small um uh pocket size handheld device so we are at the moment um trying to uh integrate that with an iPad uh working with these different companies so it will then um we'll have the kind of all uh cool features uh coming with the iPad as well and then to enable um kind of Citizen science we are developing mobile sequencing as well uh so you can put this a little adapter into your smart phone um at some point in the future hopefully not too far and then you can sequence um at home and the other devices are called uh kind of pebble and again these are in active development in RND at the moment so um in nanopore sequencing so you first prepare the sample it can be uh from blood or saliva or from um media culture or whatever your sample so sees you extract DNA and then you um there are kits available to prepare the library or you can do it uh using um automated Solutions as well so we are working with companies like Hamilton TK and pendorf and they all now have uh nanopore sequencing compatible automated Solutions as well robotic sample preparation Solutions and then you choose whatever the platform you want to use depending on your application whether it is a mid 9 or a grid done or a Promethean and then you just run the experiment and analyze data and the data analysis is uh is real time so Oxford nanopo is um um uh it's enable uh to see the full biology so you can do uh snip and index you can do methylation very accurately and you can do structural variations facing an assembly and a lot of people think about Oxford nanopore as a long read uh sequencing company which is true we can do the longest sequencing uh that has been sequenced so far like it's about 4.6 million bases but we can also do short trade sequencing as well so we can do anything in between 20 bases to 4.6 million bases if you can get longer DNA you can even do longer than 4.6 so there's no limit to the pose or whatever you put in will be read limitations actually in the kind of sample preparation to get the right size DNA fragments and so as I said before like it's scale to fit your needs you can use small versions or high-end versions that you will get uh much better output and uh with Oxford nanopo you get very simple workflows um very accessible which means the most of our high-end machines are capex free if you commit to use our machines and get reagents and flow cells you can get the uh the Box free of charge um and um and the other cool feature is this real-time data analysis while you run the experiment data will be analyzed in real time so uh most people still think that the accuracy of fox fox or nanopo is not good enough compared to some of the other short trade sequencing methods uh so over the years we have improved accuracy significantly and now it is compatible with other sequencing Technologies I uh get tasked quite a lot also like how do we improve accuracy so in another system when we improve accuracy we tackle multiple components the improved sequence in chemistry which is the uh the biological nanopore and the enzyme the improved run conditions the temperature pH the salt and voltage and so on and then we improve the platform uh the membrane and the real uh the heart they are to improve the um uh improve the signal to noise and then you get the when you get the signal signal will be uh Base called or convert into the sequence using uh these uh data analysis tools and then we also improve this software architecture uh for model training which improves accuracy uh significantly so this is uh just a snapshot of our chip or the flow cell um so in the middle uh what you see is the kind of like chip architecture in each well so you have um so we kind of work hard quite a lot on these chips over the years so when you have these little little threads it holds the membrane much better it is much stable uh so the green dots green sports are the uh the wells and in the middle uh in red you see um is the membrane and then you put the uh the pole on the membrane uh making a hole uh and biological components we engineer we have a huge um a protein engineering team we have made more than uh 10 000 versions different uh mutants of different versions of nanopos similarly we have made um thousands and thousands of motor proteins um as well to improve uh accuracy to to come to our VR so this is one of our uh posts that we have used some people are still using this chemistry which is called R9 in R9 flow cell uh the the nanopore is a protein called csgg from E coli so in this pose you can see on the right hand side um so there's a kind of like basket like architecture in the middle of the pole that's what we call the read ahead that's where the DNA is read when the DNA strand is passing through despo the um dyspo is really nice when you have a mixed sequence like atcg in a mix uh within a mixed sequence but when you have um a homopolymeric region for example a long stretch of T's OAS or G's these four struggle a little bit to read these homopolymers um especially when the home polymer region is longer than the region that can fit between the Reed head which means sometimes you will see um at the edge of the home polymeric region which is on the red in within the red box you can see at the edges you will see some deletions so instead of calling it 10 bases you might call it 9 or 8 which is kind of accuracy inaccuracy coming from um a homo polymer region what we call the um the homopolymer problem so to address that tissue so you can see also in the middle panel when there is a home polymer region the signal is fat signal is flat means less information and that is what being reflected in the area profile so in to improve that we improved the nanopore so we created an additional read ahead so when the DNA is passing through these two read heads it reads the home polymer much better so as you can see uh in the middle bottom panel um the uh the region is not flat anymore which means it has more information and you can see from the right hand side panel with r10 um at the list there are less deletions which means it's it's more accurate and we now release this r10 series and most people are now using our 10 flow cells and eventually we will uh very soon we will uh convert all our nine customers to r10 because they will get better accuracies so when you talk about accuracy there are two things one thing is single read accuracy which means like each read passed through the PO uh can be read as one molecule that and you can get the accuracy for that and then you can pile up those um reads against each other and then you can get the consensus accuracy and how many uh reads that you need to pile up to get a reasonable consensus accuracy is what we call the depth um and the top panel indicates um long read versus short read sequencing um uh kind of in a nutshell if you want to assemble a jigsaw puzzle and if you have many thousands of little pieces is difficult to assemble uh which is kind of equivalent to short trade sequencing when you assemble a genome but if you have um much larger piece is two pieces it's much easier to assemble which is equivalent to a long read sequencing so um so when we talk about accuracy as I said we talk about um Simplex accuracy which is the single read accuracy in nanopo sequencing we kind of depending on what people want to do sometimes you just want to very quickly get accuracy without spending any time which is called the fast uh so you we have three different models you can call accuracies um if you call using the fast model uh you will get it very fast but accuracy is less a little less but if you use super accuracy model it will take some time but it will be very accurate so at the moment with um a nanopo accuracy kit 14 which is uh with r104 you get 99 accuracy which is which what we call q20 q20 accuracy and if you take a consensus accuracy after aligning those reads um as you can see with can depth you will hit Q50 um uh Q50 is 99.999 percent accuracy with bacterial genomes with human genomes even with uh with 20 depth you will hit q450 which is 99.99 accuracy so um and as I said um uh so we can do a snps um is structural variance and uh still our remaining major error mode is um home polymer home polymerase as a result uh Indians are slightly lower than uh we expect but we um we are working on to improve uh home polymercus even further which will help to improve indels and with the nanopore sequencing you can also read uh methylation which is uh important for epigenetics cancer genomes and so on uh so there are two main methylation patterns you usually need to understand Phi MC and five HMC and we can we can read 5mc methylation without spending any time so it will read as another um another base modification another base and will give you the location of the modification with 99.5 percent error with accuracy and we are at the moment working on other modifications as well but five MC for HMC already released into the base color and adapt adaptive sampling is another important feature of nanopo sequencing with adaptive sampling you don't if you know a specific region that you want to sequence for example uh when you do cancer research you want to uh only sequence a specific uh cancer panel so rather than wasting your precious time and also money on sequencing non-interested region you can give the region of your interest into the um the uh our flat our system and then uh then during the experiment uh the poor it as I said it is real time based calling so while it is running while you run the experiment if it reads a region of the DNA that you are not interested in the four wheel automatically eject that sequence and capture the next Trend and if it is the right sequence it will sequence that rather than injecting so by doing so you can um you can enrich the region that you want to uh sequence quite nicely this is one example so as you can see in the bottom middle panel is The Unwanted region is not reading that region but the two other genes that you are interested in in this case it's breaker one and break R2 you can see uh you can uh specifically um read those regions very nicely so we while so this is our current chemistry uh that is available to customers but we are yeah we are kind of very kind of innovative Hub then we are working on new technologies new developments to improve accuracies and output further so something that we are working on at the moment is called duplex um uh sequencing so as I said before like in current chemistry we read only one strand and the other and other strand uh just uh goes away in duplex sequencing we capture the second strand just after the first Trend uh passes through as well by doing so we can get the accuracy for the template stand and then we can get the accuracy for the complement Strand and then you can put the two together um and get the overall accuracy uh for the DNA and then that accuracy is actually uh much higher it hits q30 which is 99.99 uh so to do that uh so there are some changes that we need to do and we've been working on uh this protocol uh for a few months now um and the the first two uh first two bars in this panel is um um uh kind of last summer so um uh the blue books are the the amount of duplex uh data you get in one experiment it was in uh um less than 40 percent but now like we are getting um by December last year we were getting uh about 80 percent of data we can collect as duplex so we are trying to improve that further which means like when you run the experiment you will see um 70 80 data in very very high accuracy the recipe will be q20 but if you get duplexio it will be Q uh q30 so um so as you can see here so the the gray is a Simplex accuracy which is q20 and blue is duplex accuracy which is q30 and you can see that um from the panel on the um on the right hand side the previous uh the PO I talked about R9 so each each row is a single strand of DNA and each dot is an error so you can see how the errors clean up when you go from R9 to r10 to R into place so when with r 10 duplex uh it's it's really nice data very um much comparable or better than some of the other Technologies available sequencing um so we first push the DNA strand through the pole uh completely and then we uh pull it out of the pole and read it by doing so you can do something called rereading so you can push it again and pull it and read for the second time you can push it again pull it and read for the third time which means like same DNA you can read multiple times to improve the to improve the accuracy so when you do that as you can see on the uh graph from the right hand side with each depth the accuracy improves significantly and after 12 13 14 you are approaching q40 accuracy so q40 uh in sequencing is very very very high accuracy and this will also enable um catching very very rare molecules in your sequencing in this particular example we mixed um one mutant of a DNA with this wild type in different combination so this in the middle graph it's the mixed in ratios of like uh 10 hundred and thousand so as you can see the spike in frequency is correlated very well with the detection frequency even after mixing one in Thousand you can detect this one molecule will very accurately with very high accuracy like 80 of data is above q30 which is quite high accuracy and by doing so you can actually catch a very rare molecule in blood disorders and things like that so it's basically catching a needle in a haystack in sequence in terms so that's all about how we improve accuracy and then we also working on quite a lot to improve the output uh uh that you get in a single flow cell one way we do it is improving the speed of the enzyme that we uh that we use in our current system we pass the DNA strand at 400 bases per second but we can improve the speed to 800 or 1000 which means you get much much more uh data so we are working on these um uh these chemistries as well so direct RNA is one of the other key feature of nanopore sequencing only Oxford nanopore can read RNA directly in all other Technologies if you want to do RNA sequencing you need to convert RNA into cdna by doing so you lose all the methylation and epigenetics information if you can read the RNA strand directly then you can retain all that information which will be very valuable for detecting diseases and so on so we have not been improving RNA for a long time um I mean it's a simple protocol as well like it takes an hour or so for the sample preparation and we run it at the moment around 60 bases per second compared to 400 basis per second for DNA and the um accuracy depending on the organism usually when you when it comes to RNA people talk about human and East RNA and we were having accuracies around um uh 90 93 or so so over the last six months we tried to improve RNA sequencing as well so we improve the speed of the enzyme that uh we are translocating RNA through from from a 60 to 120 and we also improve the sensitivity of the um RNA sequencing uh chemistry which means you can use less input material so in Gray is the output you get from um from our previous chemistry so uh either 50 nanogram or 500 nanogram um and in the um the y-axis is the number of millions of grids you get and in blue is is new chemistry and you can see you can see that with 50 nanogram of new chemistry is almost equivalent to 500 nanogram of the previous chemistry which means the sensitivity has now been improved by 10 times and also the accuracy overall improved uh to about 96 97 so this is uh in beta testing at the moment so we will release this direct RNA sequencing chemistry very soon and we are working on RNA modifications detection directly and some of the big RNA vaccine companies for example want to use these methods to QC their vaccine production as well and switching just a little bit so some another important feature of uh Nano core sequencing um I'm going to talk about this protein sequencing so as I said um nanopore sequencing is a um what we developed in Oxford nanopoe is a platform and that is a very modular platform we can easily take a PO out from a DNA sequencing it to and put a new point for different application like we do with RNA sequencing is a new phone event sign but you don't have to redesign the entire system from the beginning it's very modular system likewise we are now trying to do um protein sequencing as well so it's uh so we put a new point and then it's compatible with the protein sequencing but the challenges of protein sequencing is um it's not easy it's very difficult compared to a DNA sequencing partly because in DNA because it's negatively charged we can pull the DNA through the pole using positive potential whereas in proteins you don't have a uniform charge so therefore it is very difficult to thread the polypeptide strand through the pore and also like you have to deal with the 3D structures of a protein you need to unfold the protein first and then uh more importantly you need to deal with 20 bases instead of um four bases sorry 20 amino acid instead of four bases in um in DNA sequencing so we uh to to begin with we have decided to try a different short peptides to see what sort of signal we get so we have developed different series of posts for that so in this particular example we have captured um a short peptide in between two DNA handles and then we use the DNA motor that we use for DNA sequencing to pull um uh to to make sure to enable the uh the peptide going into the pore so what happens is you the the motor first goes through the DNA handle one and then when it comes to the peptide it will just slip through and then goes to the DNA handle too by by the time it reaches the DNA handle two the peptide region is now between the nanopore and you can read that uh peptide using the nanopore so uh the resolution at the moment is still um still very low so we have done that with uh with all kind of 20 amino acids so we constructed these um these molecules capturing five peptides in between DNA handles and in the middle of each peptide you have different amino acids either d-o-r-y-l-n and so on so we made four of those to cover all 20 amino acids and this is the the signal that you get from uh 20 different amino acids in sort of protein identification through nanopores so there are differences but it's not um uh they are yet and if you try to um uh do multiple multiple reads and combine the data so you can still see certain patterns for a certain amino acids uh or amino acid um uh classes uh when it is negative you see kind of certain pattern when it is positive you see a certain pattern and so on so we are now um in the process of improving the resolution of this further so that we can read um peptides uh with bit little bit more certainty uh so in this example is um so we got kind of uh we we lies realize the E coli we took the cell I set and then we kind of proteolytically cleave them into small pieces and then we did um sample prep version to add DNA linkers to each end and then when you um when you read it through the minion so you can see uh the orange bit is the peptide you can see different peptides give different signals but hopefully we can improve this uh further by uh improving other components I mean we still need to play with the nanopos the voltage the temperature and so on to improve the resolution which we are working on so that's the um chemistry Oxford nanopo what we are currently offering and what we are going to do uh in the near future and I will also like to talk a little bit more about applications why people uh use uh Oxford nanopo uh for sequencing so uh as I said it's a very versatile platform it's very easy to use it's cheap and it's portable and as a result people use Oxford nanopo sequencing platforms uh whether it is in outbreak in pathogens or environmental analysis human genetics transcriptomic animal diseases or plant genetics and so on so one of the early um examples of people using Oxford nanopore for Real Time pathogen surveillance is when Ebola happen I think this was around 2016 by then even the our accuracies were not that great but the team from Birmingham took um minions in their bag in the carrier bag um and set up um um a setup just mobile Labs um uh in this is in Africa and within hours they started sequencing and within hours again they got really good data to see which Ebola variants spreading in which region and so on so this is then kind of replicated during covet sequencing more than a million SAS cov2 genomes in the database are actually coming from a nanopore sequencing when uh China went to look down Chinese CDC immediately started using nanopo sequencing and then at one point all the Chinese cdc's were doing sequencing uh using Oxford nanopore technology and then we kind of It kind of spread it across the world and very quickly more than 100 countries were using um Lenovo sequencing um surveillance so one example that I am very passionate about is Sri Lanka so indica and I come from Sri Lanka so when Sri Lanka went to look down there was only one single lab that could do sequencing using a different technology but it was way too expensive they were spending 400 a sample and as a result they could only do 100 samples a month so when I um got to know about this I I talked to our CEO and donated uh one of these minions and with that they could immediately do 96 samples a day at a fraction of a course like it was like 12 dollars a sample instead of 400 a sample so then the government got to know about how easy it is to use and also um the training is only like you can do online without having people out there just watching few videos you can just get going with the nanopocity sequencing and the government got involved and they set up six labs uh in rural hospitals to do a sequencing when I visited some of those hospitals actually um you can't do anything else they didn't have space they didn't have money a Sunday nanopo sequencing most they are only Lifeline so especially in developing countries uh nanopo sequencing is is the thing to do uh when you are struggling with space and resources and money and train people so that's really a good example of democratizing sequencing you can't do any other technology uh because it's way too expensive uh for most countries um an antimicrobial resistance is one of the other big things um I think wh to predicts by 2050 more people will be um uh will be killed by antimicrobial resistance compared to cancer um so we are working with uh who and there's a big pilot project going on in India to develop a TB uh sensing sequencing essay um and it will also not only detect TB very quickly but it will also tell you um exactly what strain of KB whether it is multi-duct resistance or normal so then doctors can give medicine accordingly cancer is one of the big areas where people use nanopore sequencing cancer is like alterations of DNA and mostly it is most of the time there are like very um uh large structural variations between Cancer genome because Oxford nanopo can use don't read sequencing you can capture all these structural variations uh very nicely and also all the modifications methylation and so on so there are like plenty of examples where people use nanopo sequencing for cancer research in this particular case in in Oslo they were doing um while they were doing uh brain tumor surgery they took a sample um and the sequence um using a mean ion during the operation and then that information is critical to decide how the operation goes afterwards so you can intervene during the operation by getting real-time sequencing Data before even operation finishes so in the future these things will become hopefully uh mainstream uh there are a lot of teams across the world using nanopore sequencing for applications like this and in this particular example this this boy 13 year old boy like went to a hospital in Stanford University Hospitals uh with uh initially doctors thought he was suffering with kovid but very soon it wasn't covered but they couldn't figure out uh what what's what's wrong with him uh he was in a critical condition and at the same time um this lab been um um uh Stanford was working with us to develop methods to seek one's Human Genome in short very short time to seek one's critical irritations um because it generates a lot of data they were working with Google for data and in media for hard hardware and so on so all these teams together but this setup was ready by the time this boy got in and so they got their parents consent and started sequencing and within five hours they managed to sequence the entire Human Genome and identify that he has a very rare um heart condition because one of there was a mutation uh in in the gene so he needed heart transplant and he was put on the waiting list and very within days he got his heart transplant done so things like that is what make uh nanopo sequencing unique uh this one actually was the the largest uh the the shortest human genome ever sequence and it went to Guinness record as well um and now um a lot of people now just like start using nanopo sequencing for um uh large uh population genetics projects as well uh still a lot of people are using um shortage sequencing techniques for um large projects like this but now it's kind of slowly changing and this is one example uh in emirati genome so they want to uh sequence one million people and they're entirely done by nanopo sequencing in Abu Dhabi uh so in the future uh as I said like when you have a mobile sequencing available uh before you go to uh see your doctor you can check at home uh which um particular bacteria or virus infection you have and also like at the moment people are using um heart monitors and variables to detect your health um heart rate and so on but there are thousands of factors in the body that you don't measure uh like that you release with sweat or you release with saliva but if you can measure all these things at home you can actually take a lot of preventative action about your health before you become ill so all those things will be possible in the future with nanopo sequencing so not only in in medicine and health but in agriculture and waste water monitoring and environmental analysis people are using nanopore sequencing in the field in this particular example um it's about cassava about I think this is West Sahara um about Apparently one me 800 million people not only live on cassava as their main food source but their main income is the income coming from these cassava plantations so there was a viral infection that killed the entire cassava plantations so team from Oxford nanopo went with some professors from a few different universities and the sequence these casava Plantation in the field to identify exactly which virus infection they have and then the government got involved gave them this resistant viral resistant crops and the next year um the yield was super high um and also NASA took um Amina into space to sequence in space this is the first time ever sequencing being done in space um main idea is actually to monitor kind of health of astronauts again if you get ill in space you have to describe your symptoms to doctors on Earth but if you have them in line on board you can just take a sample sequence and say I have this virus this bacteria or they can get very specific uh personalized medicine and also obviously they want to test extraterrestrial DNA if there's any uh so this old one program is one um uh one program that we are very proud of so uh to seek one's endangered are you see an endangered species we give reagents free uh for those who are um familiar with nanopo sequencing those who have machines already in their Labs if they want to sequence endangered species we provide them with free um free reagents and kids as well so um I said at the beginning of a our mission is to sequence anything anyone by anywhere which is really democratizing sequencing and it is actually already being achieved people do sequence um uh different samples using nanopore sequencing all over the world in the field in jungles in Arctic Antarctic uh deep sea and in space so it's a very versatile platform you can use um different uh machines whether it is Promethean dynamina and depending on the number of number of posts you want and you can use um this you can choose the speed you want with the different kits um and depending on the experiment you can choose your runtime fragment length whether you want a short read or whether you is ultra long read and whether you can Multiplex or not um and you can get different versions of accuracies as well so all these things are very tunable and by doing so you can see uh the biology in full scale with Snips methylation structural variation facing and assembling and so on and just using one platform you can do not only genomics transcriptomics but hopefully we will do proteomics as well and people we are actually working with different academic groups as I said we are a platform company we can easily switch the chemistry a lot of researchers now want to use our platform for uh sugar sequencing so there's glycomics and then detect different metabolize that's meta below means so all those things possible with one platform which means you can see biology in full color so that's time for questions for like one uh how the nanopore machine maintains the protein Integrity against degradation or unfolding especially for the poor and helicase proteins sorry say again sorry so the uh nanopore machine they use poor proteins and helicase in general under working condition at working temperature proteins get degraded or unfolded after peer prolonged usage so how the nanopore technology maintains the protein Integrity so we engineer these proteins quite heavily the the poor protein we are using are heavily engineered then you can boil it and it will be still there is that stable the enzymes um we uh um we again we have engineered to improve the stability uh and and the condition we use uh because enzyme the poor will be there throughout the entire experiment like if it is for 72 hours it will be there but in time you will capture one at a time with every single strand there will be a new strand new enzyme um so enzyme will not be there for the entire time so it it is fine could you speak a little bit on the development of the current status sort of thing platform maybe repeat that question yeah yeah so voltage sensing platform is um is a way to improve the runtime because in our current Uh current flow cell um so there is a defined volume uh under the membrane in each Channel um and as a result so there's some chemistry there and during the run so this chemistry in these Wells deplete so as a result we cannot run more than like say 72 hours but the voltage sensing platform bring kind of addresses that tissue making the volume underneath the membrane much larger it's a it's a common chamber and by doing so you can run it much longer so that is inactive development and then the the other question I had was are you guys working on on Flow cell sample prep and you know things like you know on on Flow cell uh Library prep or amplification where you can truly kind of you know spit in one end and you know sequence with them so the um we do develop we uh we are developing a new flow cell uh uh with which you can do sequencing without having a lab at all to do the sample preparation so idea is uh so you um like like code like you take a swab either from the cheek or from saliva and then you can put it swap directly into the flow cell um and you just like open a lid and put the uh Swap and close the lid and there is a um uh there's a layer of gel that has a different electrode so it goes through electrophoresis and then transfer DNA from Top closer to the bottom floor cell which will be then captured by an enzyme for sequencing yeah thank you so much for the wonderful talk I have two questions about the speed and also the data well about the speed well I think it's in the first decade of the century uh I think your supervisors and many other faculty spend a lot of time to find an optimal speed to balance the EU and also the data accuracy 300 to 400 base pair per second would be it's that's the the wonderful uh balance of that but now you um the company is going to increase from 400 base pair per second to 800. um so can can the machine maintains the reasonable accuracy and that's my second question is the data storage well when we run a direct RNA sequencing a single Minion would generate about a few hundred gigabyte per Annex a greater well that would cause a lot of uh in in a data storage and data manager and then does the company have any plan to improve the the data format to improve the data management yeah thank you so to answer the first question uh yeah so when you improve the um when you increase the speed um significantly accuracy does come down uh so we uh it's a very delicate balance between the accuracy and the speed output and speed so you need to do uh step by step you kind of improve accuracy speed little bit then you need to match the accuracy you need to improve again and match the accuracy and so on so that's what we are doing because of that it takes some time we will because we are now at q20 and q30 we will not improve speed at the expense of accuracy so we will maintain accuracy but we will also try to improve the output by improving the speed um so data storage is yeah it's a good question I mean we are working with um whenever uh all kind of new um Hardware is available new uh with new GPU so we work with all these companies to improve um uh onto data storage as well so we do address that question I think so it was fun to hear hear about this a lot of good progress I guess my first question that I had in my mind can if I was stopped thinking about I was not so much storage but just uh sharing of the data you know for example the communities just thinking about communities so the endangered species species group I mean is there some kind of community that's trying to bring all this data together and yeah that's true yeah or one is data should be shareable so all the people who join that program uh agree to share data yeah that's cool and then I was wondering on the uh analytics side are there is there a community that's evolving that is sharing software to analyze that yeah something good to know about it yeah when you join uh as a customer so you get access to the community and within that Community like people share all sort of stuff uh the different different tools that they developed they share everything yeah yeah yeah that's good any other questions oh thank you for your wonderful talk I have a question about the material usage on for my previous experience of r d sequencing I'm saying if I have um one thousand DNA molecules um but only one molecules can go through the only poor so is there any new progress about how to improve this um efficiency uh so the the yeah so the uh the voltage sensing platform that the previous question so uh instead of at the moment like we are uh limited to the uh the number of posts in in one flow cell to like in a mid 9 we have 512 in Promethean we have Tau 3000 in the um uh this new flow cell that in development we aim to have 100 000 channels in the voltage sensing platform so that will improve the output significantly as well so that will capture a lot more strand but because even though it goes at one at a time right after the one stand pass through the will capture the second strand so uh the poor occupancy is always very high so there's not much time that o is pending without sequencing um so I'm very interested in the Adaptive sampling um just uh um for example um if I um have um one microgram DNA so um use the Adaptive sampling I can get the Target in region so what's the difference between use adapted sampling and I just sequenced all the this sample because the the loading amount is I think is similar yeah so what's the advantage of adaptive sampling Advantage is the uh first of all time so you don't need to kind of um if you just sequence those regions like if you need to say sequence um uh 300 base pair region instead of like billions uh so it will cut down the time and also if you uh reduce the amount of time that you use for sequencing you can use that flow cell for something else so it will be much cheaper for you thank you very much again and he's here for a few minutes you can ask any questions later thank you thank you
