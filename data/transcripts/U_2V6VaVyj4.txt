uh all right shall i get started aaron or marcy do you want to at least meet yourself and let me know um yeah you're welcome too okay great uh well thank you for joining me uh on this uh october afternoon uh and it's uh it's gonna be fun to uh to share with you some some some new stuff so well i guess uh it's not entirely new stuff but it's it's framed in a very new way for me so um so it'll be a little bit uh raw i guess and that's good uh so i wanted to get this talk on systems chemistry and uh oh i guess i should first introduce myself so my my name's tim uh i'm an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry uh and our labs are are in the chemistry building uh we we are focused on a merger of chemical synthesis and data science and so i'm excited to uh to meet with the bioinformatics group uh today uh and and particularly share some of these ideas that we have brewing around a concept we're calling systems chemistry uh and we're trying to learn from systems biologists and so if you know if you uh if you're an expert in this area uh we we would certainly you know uh welcome uh your feedback and and discussion on um on on kind of the systems concept as we as we try to apply it to chemistry so uh so i want to start here with this idea of chemical space and and you know the molecules are these uh entities in chemical space that do things and that you know this is what um a lot of uh industries are gravitating towards you know a lot of uh molecules do things right so there's medicines that's that's from the pharmaceutical industry uh there's dyes which uh you know could come from textiles there's fragrances coming from the perfume industry and and these are all molecules that have functions uh they're they're molecules that must be synthesized right or well i guess a lot of what i'm showing here are natural products but many of these need to be synthetically made so we need to design molecules and then make them and and and this is this is what interests us is this making bit of it and how that influences the design and ultimately what i what i hope to uh make a thesis on today is how that influences function that the the design the synthesis and the function of these molecules are delicately uh intertwined um through through what i call systems chemistry and so i thought it'd be good to start on this on this super depressing note uh if we go back to uh 40 years to to look at uh systems uh you know just systems models as a whole and so uh so um aminabhi and still for in 1980 we're talking about models of carbon dioxide and and its role in in climate change and you know all of our grandparents kind of said oh well you know we'll worry about that in the future um but um the this idea that there's you know there's there's systems level complexity that the turning the knob over here has a significant influence of something over here and so you know like today we're able to think about uh the carbon dioxide system and and cycle and how it influences cycle change and maybe tie that to things like i don't know a fire happening in brazil or you know an increase in gdp in southeast asia or you know lowering gas prices in in the middle east or something like this that you know that it's important for us to understand this at a systems level and how these how these big macroscopic uh events interplay with each other and so so i wanted to to explore how that might um relate to to molecules in chemical space and and how you know how we need to think about where these molecules come from what it is they need to do uh and then from our labs perspective how you're gonna make them uh we're we're very interested in in how molecules get made and we spend a lot of our time making molecules in my lab and so from this we we we've come up with this idea of systems chemistry uh that uh that we we're thinking of in this way that that you know that's that that these molecules that need to be invented they they have these sophisticated functions if it's a drug it needs to you know dissolve in the aqueous layer of your stomach and then get to maybe get to your brain if it's an alzheimer's drug and then then interact with it with the disease targeted in your brain uh and and these are very complex functions right but so so that's that's at the function level and and already this idea of dissolving and getting to the brain is kind of tying in properties which is delicately intertwined with structure um and then i think what we're bringing to the table is this idea that transformations and reaction conditions are are are heavily intertwined with all of this and i think that this is this is this is what is not yet appreciated in in my uh experience that you know there's there's a pretty clear connection between structure and function i think that that is well known within medicine but the idea that chemical transformations and conditions uh play an intimate role in all of this is is the case that i want to make um and so we're we're looking for ways that we can you know study the connections between transformations and conditions transformations and structure conditions and function conditions and properties um and all of this and so i want to share a few vignettes from from work that we're currently doing in our lab uh some work that we publish some that we haven't yet published and and also some work that i published uh before getting here um and so uh i i'd be curious to hear feedback on on this if there's people who have expertise in systems biology um but here's my understanding of what systems biology is is largely trying to tackle is that systems biology is is looking at uh metabolites proteins genes and pathways and trying to tie that to disease trying to understand how metabolites and pathways are interconnected and that links to a disease so from this i draw a correlation to what i call systems chemistry where we have transformations conditions structure and properties linking to molecular function so the end goal here is molecular function we want to have you know that alzheimer's drug that gets to the brain and does its thing that's its function or a perfume that you know that that has a volatility so it lasts you know eight hours uh and and it smells um like roses that's that's like uh you know a different function that we would try to tie all the way back to transformations and reaction conditions so let's talk about transformations uh a little bit uh so this is um this is an area where we've we've made our first disclosure uh very recently and and we're super excited about this idea uh of of you know thinking more deeply on chemical transformations when i say transmissions what i mean is a reaction but a chemical reaction needs to have both the transformation and it needs to have the right uh recipe of reaction conditions that's what we're actually going to put into the flask so that we arrive at a structure and that structure has properties that that are linked to its function uh and so i want to go back to 1966 where so another thing that really drives us and i'll get into this later is this idea of a robochemist we love you know i'm going to talk about algorithms for a little bit we also love to talk about robotics and so um there's you know there's this excitement around having robots make a molecule so i've been talking about perfumes i've been talking about medicines and and at the end of the day you know the kind of star trek like future of all of this is that you get to hit a button and a robot makes the makes the molecule that you need um you know you would say oh you know i have this certain type of cancer and you hit a button and then a very specific molecule uh to treat that type of cancer for you comes at the end i think that you know this is something that all uh chemists and and and multiple fields are excited about hopefully our grandkids will get to enjoy such a platform but um going back to 1966 we were already using robots and chemistry uh and um and and one of the key aspects of this particular robot shown here being driven by bruce merrifeld who won the nobel prize for for these um these studies uh is the application to the synthesis of peptides so this is this is an early peptide synthesizer uh and what is key here is that it's making amide bonds and uh so that you know peptides are are amides um uh you you know you take valene and you click it together with proline um and then you click on glycine and all of those are are amid bonds that are being formed along the way um through through the amide coupling reaction and so you know i i i guess i didn't say in my introduction that i spent nine years working in in the pharmaceutical industry before i came here and it became very clear to me that the amid coupling is is by far the most popular reaction used in all of drug discovery uh it's it's you know the most important reaction i think used in in all of uh organic chemistry uh and and you know i don't know if i don't know to what degree this uh this achievement of bruce merifeld really ceded um that that reality that the am coupling is so so important today um but it is something that you can automate robotically uh and and i think that this is um you know the amid coupling has indeed become the most popular reaction of them all so what i'm showing here is an analysis of pharmaceutical patents uh and pharmaceutical publications this is this is uh i i read you the pie chart myself but this is not um my analysis you can read about it here from johannesburg uh and uh this is well appreciated by by any practitioner of medicinal chemistry i think that the amid coupling it makes up the biggest chunk of the pie in terms of individual reactions so these are these are uh reactions that have been reported in patents and publications towards the development of pharmaceuticals and what you can do is is look at all the reactions that are described in these documents and start counting them uh and what you'll see is that uh is that you know there's some that rise to the top there's some reactions that we just use very frequently in drug discovery now the ramifications of that are that you know that reaction imparts a certain footprint onto the molecule so if you're making an amide bond using this super popular amide coupling uh you you know you're going to install a uh a hydrogen bond donor you're going to end up with a hydrogen bond acceptor the the reaction is a little bit polar or so the the product is a little bit polar um so that may improve your your water solubility but it also is um uh it may have issues with metabolic stability uh if if you're trying to have like a once daily pill then then maybe the pharmacokinetics of an amide bond um are potentially less desirable than than than other um aspects and so you know if you've been engaged in pharmaceutical design you've likely talked about uh the types of objectives that we steer towards you know you you want a pill that dissolves and and and uh has uh metabolic stability enough so that you know you you've got it in your bloodstream for 24 hours let's say so the amide coupling uh is is is the most important reaction and it imparts this this this set of properties onto the molecule the suzuki coupling is is the second most popular uh and then followed by um the cn coupling uh um amine electrophile couplings like reductive elimination and then a simple uh removal of bhakti protection takes up the the the fifth spot of the pie uh before we get into a diversity of all kinds of other reactions um and but but in terms of single reactions the end coupling eats up one quarter of the pie of all reactions run in in the one trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry let's talk about that so why is it that you are presented with an amine and an acid and you know more than any other time uh or any other type of reaction choose to click the amine and the acid together to form this animate bond as i articulated you've got a hydrogen bond donor this nh you have a hydrogen bond acceptor uh with it with the carbonyl group it's a little bit polar uh so there's there's a certain amount of you know properties that get baked into the molecule by choosing this reaction now as i showed you know you can automate this you can run the amide coupling on robots that makes it uh you know um easy to to to run in high throughput uh it's a robust reaction it works it works well uh and so it's something that we choose but we wanted to ask the question why why why why is this the one why is this the reaction when it turns out that there are many other ways that you can click these two pieces together so you can take an amine and an acid and you can have them unite for instance in this in the top left corner here through a decarboxylation to make a cn bond or maybe you could do a deamination in this next molecule to make an ester bond or maybe you could do a deamination decarboxylation and make a carbon-carbon bond um there's you know maybe ways you could do an alpha functionalization of the amine or an alpha functionalization of the acid beta functionalizations the list goes on and on and you can see that we have like these cute little notation systems to try and help us keep track of all the possibilities it turns out that there are many many many many ways that you can click together an amine and acid and almost all of them are completely unknown but what's what's what's what resonates from that is that each one of these has a unique set of properties right so starting from the same two molecules we can arrive at something that is basic we can arrive at something that is acidic we can arrive at something that is super greasy or something that is super polar and these types of properties are going to influence the function of the molecule they're going to influence whether the molecule goes to the brain or whether it goes through the liver or whether it just goes straight through the kidneys and out into the toilet um and so these are uh these are i think important questions to ask and why we want to drive towards this idea of systems chemistry and think about how does the transformation relate to the properties so we went through this enumeration um uh we we have a pretty simple algorithm for for uh tying this together so you take uh an amine is uh is is drawn on uh in in these little circles where we have an alpha carbon a beta carbon and a is the is the nh2 in this case uh and uh and then similarly the acid has either a b you can you can add on to the oxygen or you can add onto the carbon you can add on to the uh of the carbonyl rather uh and then uh you can also add in the alpha carbon or the beta carbon um uh this is just to show that you know this we're doing this for amino acid here but it's completely abstractable to uh to any pair of functional groups uh you could have a case where you lose the amine you could have a case where you lose the carboxylic acid and you could have a case where you lose both the amine and carboxylic acid so if you play with this algorithm uh you build out all the possible transformations and then and then we we arrive at a fun visualization like this what i'm showing you here is 320 transformations uh that are new ways that you can connect an amine and acid together uh and they're almost all completely unknown and and the way this visualization works is that if there is a purple line or or a yellow or blue line that is tying the transformation which is uh which is numbered one through 320 around the periphery of this circle into one of the known drugs or natural products in the drug bank database what that means is that all of these reactions wherever you see a purple line that is a reaction that could be used to synthesize a drug or could be used to synthesize a natural product however that reaction does not yet exist with the exception of maybe a dozen of these um these are unknown reactions and so that is uh i think that's that that that's our opportunity right these are all reactions that could be invented uh and um and and that's that's that's something that inspires us we get excited about you know the the possibility to invent any of these new reactions um and so we we we've done some of this we've we wanted to ask the question do reactions control properties and and we show that here so so i uh the students in the lab took um uh uh p-toluene and ortho-toluic acid these two simple molecules up top they clip them together by the amide coupling uh and you get this molecule in a 91 yield using oxalyl chloride and triethylamine as our reaction conditions uh that gives us the amide bond which is you know the way that you're supposed to bring together an amine and an acid um but we found that you could also do this reductive coupling where you arrive at a at a basic amine um you could do this this kind of a strange cyclization event um where we where we use this iodo benzene catalyst and oxone and um this uh this this forms this tricyclic rigid molecule very aromatic um fluorescent molecule um we can do an ortho functionalization with loss of ammonia uh and that gives us this molecule down here in the bottom left corner we can decarboxylate from there and then get this this super super greasy um by arrow molecule or we can do a deamination and form the complementary ester to the amide and this is a neat reaction for us because it makes a molecule that's got the same shape uh and and a very comparable electronics to the amide but it's got one fewer hydrogen bond donors so the molecule in the bottom uh right corner is very much like the molecule in the top left corner except that the nhs swap for an oxygen and that has ramifications uh in terms of the permeability of of a molecule into getting into cells uh and particularly for crossing the blood-brain barrier if you were trying to make a brain-targeting um molecule but but the the the cool part is this right so that what i'm showing you here is the spread of available properties from clicking together this amine and this acid um the this is a kernel density estimate that shows that the spread of available molecular weight log p which is a marker of the lipophilicity of these molecules and polar surface area which is kind of a marker of their hydrogen bond um accepting uh characteristic and the gray lines represent all the different molecules here so what you can see is that for log p for instance we're spanning almost from two up to like 3.7 or something like this almost almost uh almost two full orders of magnitude um we can we can access in terms of lipophilicity which is going to correlate with the ability to get to the brain or to have good metabolic stability versus poor metabolic stability um all of this is done simply by changing the reaction conditions and this this is what this is what inspires me this is what i get super excited about this idea of of systems chemistry is that we have we have attempted to make something that is perhaps brain targeting by changing reaction conditions and and i think that that is that's you know where this whole thing comes together as a systems where we tie uh transformations to conditions to properties to structure and function um then then you know the idea that you could have a catalyst that makes a molecule that is liver targeting and a complementary catalyst that makes a molecule that is brain targeting is something that is is really exciting to me that you know that you could you could hit the liver or the brain by by choosing nickel or palladium from the periodic table uh is is one of the things that we're you know we're trying to drive towards um so that's that's an example there of of tying transformations to properties um and and this was uh the first report from our our new lab um we were very lucky to be able to publish this in the journal nature and we're obviously very proud of that uh accomplishment i want to talk now about reaction conditions um and go back a little bit into my my career in industry and and also um you know bring bring it forward to what we're doing here in michigan um but i have a long uh history of of exploring reaction conditions using robotics and algorithms and i'd like to talk about that with you for a little bit and show you how that fits in so um i mean the the the summary of this is is is shown here we the uh you know the the punch line is that we like to run miniaturized reactions we run we run lots of reactions on a super small scale um and you know by miniaturizing we we get to uh we get more information density out of our experiments it's the whole moore's law um approach to to chemical synthesis here and so we've been trying to miniaturize and get more and more information out of our reactions and start to study things on the systems level um and the details have been published over the past five years or so um and um and and getting into the weeds of how this works right so that so we we we think about running reactions in a flask we do this in my lab all the time uh we love to run reactions in flasks um but you know that that burns through a lot of material um it's it's you know it takes up real estate we we have precious real estate especially these days with social distancing in the lab um and so uh it also burns up you know very expensive reagents so so we would like to miniaturize and get smaller and smaller so you know more frequently uh when we're working in our lab we're if we're running a single reaction we're going to do it in one of these vials that's not new to us every every lab that does synthetic chemistry uses these types of vials but here you know we can start to miniaturize and use uh less and less material but um one of the one of the tools that we use a lot is these so-called micro vials which are the the the two right most vials here um and these are these are really really small little glass shell vials that we put tiny little magnetic stir bars inside and now we can run reactions on like uh you know like on on on the bigger of these two vials we would use between one and four milligrams um and in the smaller of the vials we would run you know kind of like half a milligram or one milligram reactions with a tiny little adorable stir bargain site um and so um we this is this is what we do in our lab we call it high throughput experimentation uh and we have miniaturized even further as i showed in the previous slide down to running this in 1536 well plates um that's really um a a story in engineering uh to you know to to try and make these reactions that that operate in in volatile solvents uh with uh with reagents that that may be poorly soluble in the solvents that we want to use um and uh and you know they they they uh they tend to be devilishly reactive with plastics and of course the the whole realm of of automation and well played which is all all in the world of plastic um but uh but anyways we've done tons of engineering on this and uh and and published on this quite a bit um here are some early pictures from building the lab uh so we we do this all in an inert atmosphere glove box so here's um anna and bo uh doing uh experiments inside of our glove box so the reagents that we want to use are are very sensitive to air they will decompose rapidly if exposed to air uh or moisture and so we need to protect them from that um they um they you know sometimes they'll like burst into flames and that's that's certainly something we certainly don't want um and uh you know we we use lots of uh pipettes yeah i i anticipate a lot of people on the call um would question why i would show a picture of multi-channel pipettes uh but uh for us in in our community that is a relatively novel concept as i as i've alluded to we work with volatile solvents we work with stuff that will decompose plastics and so you know the realm of multi-channel pipettes is not well integrated with synthetic chemistry and so a synthetic chemistry lab uh that that is doing this type of high throughput experimentation um is is uh is is somewhat unique uh and and that's uh that's you know we we have this kind of like mixed engineering challenge and data science challenge of handling all the data that comes out of these things sometimes we shine blue lights on stuff um that that can make reactions uh work differently um we have a series of robots in the lab um this uh in the top right corner you see this one with the little green uh footprint um is what's called the mosquito and that's what we use for running our our 1536 wall experiments we do our analysis oh the mosquito is shown down here in the bottom left corner it's these are like little tiny little tips uh that dose at the reagents you can imagine that there's a red blue and yellow reagent um this is uh meant to uh honor the uh colombian flag um for my my dear friend alexander betrayal centennial who did some of this work uh and is a very proud colombian um and we do the analysis by hplc mass spec so we run lots of reactions and we analyze them by hplc mass spec so we get a mass spec readout did the reaction work yes or no um and then we get lots of data right so we can run 1500 reactions in an experiment that gives us lots of data and then we then we start to process that and so you know i i'm excited to be um interacting today with the bioinformatics uh community we you know we we aspire to to be um uh engaged in the chemo informatics world um and as a synthetic chemistry lab uh that is heavily invested in python i think that that's that makes for a pretty fun interface uh of research that uh that it's ongoing in our in our space and so um uh here's here's bo um working in the glove box not wearing a lab coat he's supposed to wearing the lab coat while he's doing that work and hopefully he's he's learned from that mistake uh but beau wrote this uh this beautiful software called uh factor in in collaboration with uh with a lot of um help in our lab and i just want to introduce this so so we're going to do we're going to do reactions on robots or frequently i mean the plates that are glowing blue down here these were all set up by hand using these multi-channel pipetters uh this is most frequently how we set one of these up is we set up uh 24 or 96 reactions uh and then when we when we have a system that we understand quite well then we start plugging into the 1536 uh capability uh but but all of this is an exercise in data handling and so uh so one of the first things we wanted to do when building the lab was to to build an information management software which we call factor so factor is a software that uh that has been written in our lab um we're we're trying to decide what to do with it now and and i would welcome feedback from from anyone who has experience here so we we have like a software that we've written it's really cool it does everything that we want um there's there's a lot of people that are interested in a software like this and so the question i guess that we're up against is like do we do we try to make some money off of this or do we just go open source uh and and let the community um have at it um and you know we're at that decision point right now if you have uh if you have experience here i would love to hear from you either in the q a or or or please do reach out afterwards but but factor is is a information management software that helps us drive these experiments um so you design your screen and factor i'll show that to you in a second and then you decide are you going to set it up manually or send it to a robot in any event it's going to um it's going to be sent to a uplc ms for analysis in our lab we could easily plug in other analytical techniques but we use uplcms and then then you get the output data from which you can perform your analysis and decide if you know if your objective has been satisfied or if you want to go back into factor and run a follow-up screen to learn from the data and where we're um actively engaged in pushing you know the these loops to be driven uh algorithmically so that you know you'd have like some type of active learning reinforcement loop that says okay here is the output of that experiment that tells me what to do for my next experiment and then i learned from that and then we go forward where where you know we're we're doing all that kind of stuff but i'd say right now we're we're just getting really good at the the engineering part of this right now um and setting this up um so you know right right now running screens in our lab is you know something we we can do very easily um we can hammer out um a little 24 well a screen like this a student can can have the idea for uh and then with using factor um in in a matter of minutes can set up the recipe and and and have you know full documentation of the experiment moving forward so um i'm showing just a screenshot here of being a few steps in where we have a recipe grid uh shown with these these pretty colors on the side um and all the different bars represent the different combinations of reagents that are going into each of these wells these reagents are things like shown uh in in the left here so indium bromide scandium triplate aluminum chloride uh tris pentafloro uh fennel uh um uh borate is is is one of the ones that we um that we use so so someone here must have been looking at a uh lewis acid screen um for a particular reaction that they were interested in uh and all of this takes moments to set up it's it's connected to our inventory um and and really we were really striving for like a really user-friendly experience when designing this software uh and um as you click through you you get to um you get to the data right so so i mentioned that um that we're going to do all our analysis by uplc ms we get a number of different endpoints out of these the this technique so we get you know we get retention time um we get uh area um uh integrations of of the different peak areas from our hplc uh using using either mass spec or uv uh and now uh we're just now setting up a technique called elsd so that we'll have multiple different ways we can look at individual peaks um and then the data is automatically fed into factory you you can drop down uh from the different uh different readouts and look at these uh different heat maps and we would like to kind of have this triptych view where you have three of them uh side by side because that can help you to say okay like this one is showing me uh you know the the disappearance of starting material this one is showing me the appearance of of a particular product and this one is is uh showing me the appearance of a side product that i don't uh i don't want to be in there and so we use this to kind of you know visually inspect the data and try and understand where to go from there uh here's here's a case of this esterification reaction that i that i mentioned earlier when we were talking about transformation so we have um we have a diazonium salt which has been prepared from uh from from the amine so we do this activation of the amine we're gonna click it together with an acid and we're not gonna do the amide coupling that's our trick right we're trying to take amines and acids and do not amid couplings in this case we were trying to uh optimize this esterification reaction and so yuning shen in the lab uh took factor designed this screen uh where she was looking at uh at a series of different ligands uh so pyridine dt bpy triphenylphosphine and xanthops and a series of different metal catalysts so copper iodide palladium acetate uh nickel chloride with or without silver nitrate uh we uh we then go physically set up this experiment in the glove box manually uh and analyze the results and then we get a readout like this so this is a typical uh readout from one of these screens uh here pyridine with copper iodide and silver nitrate are the best conditions to run this reaction is what we learned from this screen uh and then we've taken that further uh and uh and and optimized this uh to uh to reaction that works actually uh very robustly across many different substrates um and and that's something that i show here so young and bo partnered on on plugging this reaction into our mosquito software uh and um uh and and generating uh a lot of uh reaction data for uh the subs for exploring the substrate scope of this reaction so here what ying has done is taken four different uh diazonium salts three of them the bottom three shown here are derived from amine drugs so here's sulfidoxin uh sulfoxazole and metaclopramid um these are these are various drugs that we were able to get our hands on uh convert to this activated um diazonium form and then and then union can clip them together with any one of 96 different carboxylic acids um she chose to run this in quadruplicate because we really wanted to get a readout on on the the reproducibility of this reaction and so when you interpret this heat map you're looking at four uh four different uh replicates for the same reaction that are clustered in a little square so uh hopefully you can see that there's there's kind of like a little bit of pixelation to each uh each square and so if the colors are exactly the same then that was a wholly reproducible reaction there's a couple instances where if we look over here at like o8 in the bottom right corner um there's a purple there's a purple well meaning that that that reaction did not work and whereas the other three replicates for that particular instance did work uh so you know we do encounter scenarios where where we don't get perfect uh reproducibility but uh nonetheless we we're we're quite happy with this i mean i i think across 1536 reactions uh you can see that there's there is pretty good fidelity uh between um you know from one reaction to the next uh and so this gives us faith that these reactions that we're running on a super tiny scale we run these on like 0.05 milligram scale which is very small for for a synthetic chemist uh is um uh is reproducing and indeed we we then uh take these and then go scale them up in lab and so ying has done that very beautifully here uh where she's demonstrating the substrate scope of her her reaction so these are all reactions that were run um on that super small scale um using using uh conditions that we uh we eventually optimized up to uh uh copper uh bf4 um two four six colliding uh in in uh cedar nitrile um actually we ran it in benzonitrol for the screen but we tend to run the reaction in in acetonitrile um and uh and here uh here you see these are reactions that were run uh on large scale so these are reactions run on 25 or 50 milligram scale where union has has done a very classical uh reaction in a flask uh or at least a large vial um put the put the reaction mixture onto a column chromatography to purify the mixture out and then you know got a white powder at the end and gone and weighed that on the balance and said okay you know for the coupling of p-toluene with with enbo valene uh here i get an 80 isolated yield on on 25 milligram scale um and so i mean this is this is very rewarding right because it tells us that we can we can explore synthetic chemistry on a super teeny tiny scale we can generate lots of information but then that information is going to translate to the larger scale where we traditionally run things and we're ultimately going to need to run things if we want to you know get our hands on these molecules and actually do something with them and so uniting has shown that this works for lots of simple acids and simple amines and also a few complex uh amines and complex acids um uh shown here so um so uh here's sulfidoxin coupling to enbox the alien um this is a glyceritic acid um which i um there was there was like a kind of uh assorted um headline in on cne knew seeing cnn recently um about a man i maybe you read about this a man died from eating black licorice so a man in massachusetts was eating a bag of black licorice every day um and uh and and he died um unfortunately for after after like six weeks of eating black licorice um candy you know every all day every day at work um he died from an overdose of the carboxylic acid that is shown here this glycoretinic acid is one of the main natural products that is found in licorice um and it i think it you know probably has anti-inflammatory um activities when taken in in moderate dose but you you can overdose on it as as sadly we now know uh but anyways it works uh very well in in uh union's reaction uh and so you know we're we're really inspired that this reaction works well on on simple acids simple amines uh complex acids and complex amines and i think that's gonna that really points to um what we call the substrate scope and we want this thing to you know to have a good substrate scopes that it can be used in lots of different settings um so uh so i'd like to now try and tie together transformations and conditions for you so we've been talking about conditions for the last little while uh and and i've been showing some chemical structures uh but you know we started talking about transformations that we want to hack the amid coupling and have you know have non-amid couplings to wait to bring together amines and acids and we showed how how that links to properties um and how how careful selection of the reaction conditions is important for that uh and indeed that that ties to structure um and then we know that structure and properties are intimately linked to function and so there's you know there's this web of of interactivity that that is exciting to us um that we're trying to explore here within systems chemistry i want to take a little bit of a detour right now and talk about uh the interplay of transformations and conditions um and so you know i showed you how we're hacking transformations to think about amines and acids and and that's what i would call a single reaction right where we we um we have the amide coupling and i just showed you unions uh esterification coupling so we have like an amid coupling and a complementary ester esterification coupling those are those are single reactions but you can make a lot of molecules with a single reaction but lots of times you have to string together several reactions to make a new molecule like a drug right is is is is a pretty sophisticated little molecule it needs to have um a number of reactions that have been strung together in a sequence to build it and we call that uh retrosynthesis or we call the analysis of these sequences is is called retrosynthesis and we've been engaged in this uh in this idea in partnership with the company no poor sigma um and and most recently you know we had to we had to take a very significant pivot on this to address um uh what you know to do what we could to address the covet crisis uh so you know we we've been uh very actively engaged in exploring uh the use of retrosynthesis and automated retrosynthesis and artificial intelligence within a uh within retrosynthesis for the discovery of new molecules and neural reactions um along comes february 2020 and uh and you know we're we're all stuck at home on zoom right so um so uh we we needed to um uh think about how we could use our talents and and the things that we were working on to address this global uh pandemic that we find ourselves in um and one of the things that became immediately clear and and it was you know that that millipore sigma uh quite urgently reached out to us on so miliport sigma is a is a chemical supplier and they realize that the supply of chemicals that are used to make the drugs that are needed for copic 19 uh is is going to run out or or is is is threatened and will be stressed right i mean we ran out of um toilet paper and hand sanitizer and macaroni and cheese and these are like low-tech products and so you know a drug that's going to like find its way to your lung tissue and uh and attack a virus an alien virus and then have like the metabolic stability needed so that you can take like a once daily dose that is a high-tech product right so so if we're running out of the low-tech products on shelves imagine what's going to happen to the high-tech products and so we wanted ways to uh to come uh to these molecules um that would there would be like a backup strategy and so the question was this is this is going back to march right it wasn't known which molecules we should care about today you know ram deserver is a molecule that gets talked about uh and as is uh dexamethasone or these these are drugs but you know i i say there are currently uh 3100 clinical trials um this slide is maybe uh four weeks old so i don't know if that's um uh if that number is still accurate but there there are a lot of clinical trials under uh underway right now to explore the uh repurposing of diverse drugs for coping 19 and if one of them should turn out to be the one uh we may need a billion doses of the thing right there there is not a billion doses of many drugs on this planet i doubt if there's a billion doses of any drug on this planet so we're going to need more than one way to make these molecules um and so uh so i want to talk about the interplay of reaction uh transformations and reaction conditions as we get into this and so what i'm showing you here are four uh such molecules um that you may have heard uh uh heard of on the news uh so rem deserver is one that is i say it's approved here it's actually got it doesn't have a full fda approval it has um emergency authorization uh use uh but rendezvous is one that you've heard about um and uh and then bromhexane is is a tempus2 inhibitor uh which may have relevance it is being studied uh in five clinical trials umafinovir is actually a coronavirus attacking drug it was it was um designed in the uh in the sars uh cov1 outbreak um and fava piravir as well as another antiviral protease inhibitor uh which could have relevance and so it's it's being studied in 27 clinical trials towards uh quran virus um uh and so what i show down below are are these are these reaction networks and the way you interpret these is uh is the yellow dot in the center of each of these webs is the molecule that is drawn up above so that the yellow dot here is ram deserve um this yellow dot is is uh um uh and um what is shown below in the the gray uh lines leading to orange circles are sequences of reactions that are used in the patent and public literature uh to make this molecule so these are recipes that one can use to make um a fenugreeker and they arrive at the starting materials that are orange dots and so our hypothesis is that the world is going to eat up all of the supply of these orange dots and we need other ways to to make these molecules we need a way to get um a fan of beer if we run out of the starting materials that are the orange dogs and so we partnered with milk or sigma they have a artificial intelligence called cynthia that is a software that enables one to do retrosynthesis and break apart a target molecule into new pieces but we wanted to um use it in a very unique way and so we train their software to uh to look for starting materials that are not these orange dots and so what you see going up top are routes that we have designed uh using cynthia that arrive in in these pink dots these pink dots are starting materials that are different than the starting materials that are down here so if we if we burn through all of the supply of the the orange ones um then then uh we are providing recipes uh to get uh to get to these uh potential uh coveted drugs uh via the pink dots that will that you know will hopefully relieve some of the stress on the supply chain um and so you know when i talk about the amine acid coupling um and how you know that's like a single transformation oftentimes what we need to do is string together many transformations to get to a sophisticated molecule like rem deserver or bromhexane or fevopiravir uh and so each one of the you know purple or pink dots is uh is a different intermediate uh and and the arrows uh are connecting them are reaction steps along the way um and uh going up from the literature we have the you know the the orange and gray dots um the gray dots are intermediates um that are they're already reported um and so what we have here is a recipe for uh for for a backup uh to uh to the small kid and i just want to show the experimental execution of some of this uh so here is uma fenevir um the uh the the final target shown here um drawn all the way over on the right uh here is the network of uh of uh uh uh uh routes to this molecule both the uh the existing uh routes from the literature and our sequences uh which are are drawn uh this time uh flipped uh 90 degrees so they're drawn uh from left to right uh and so at this point i mean this was this is where we did you know like kind of uh macgyver type stuff that was uh that was um uh it was a type of science i've never done before because this was happening in late march early april uh we so we you know we we were uh we were one of the first labs uh in in uh we were the first lab in our building to reopen um to start doing research and we were one of the first labs on campus to reopen it start doing you know there was very little known about how to how to do chemistry in the lab uh in april um you know we bought walkie-talkies we we um our our sponsor milipor sigma uh was able to find us n95 masks remember how difficult it was to find an n95 mask in april um and uh so uh so you know there was there was like a lot of uh a lot of kind of like boot camp you know like uh hit the ground running to perform this uh and and and all of it is them due both to the scientific bravery but also just the personal bravery of uh ying fu lin and and rojong uh who are two extremely talented postdocs in our lab uh who perform this work and so what's shown here is uh we had performed the analysis of of uh of uh routes towards uh uma fenevir uh and then ying fu and rose went into lab and actually demonstrated that our our ai predicted routes worked and so um so uh they each one of these is a reaction that they executed in uh in the month of april or may uh and showed that we could we could you know we can really do this we can take these molecules that are our starting materials that are not used in the uh in the existing synthesis of lumifeniavir and we can use uh predicted conditions from the ai to actually make the uh the molecules and and get us to our final product um and so should we run out of uma foundation and need to make more of it this these are these are four uh different recipes that we are providing uh to uh to make this molecule and i'm highlighting uh one of these particular reactions here that rose was working on we're trying to connect uh a molecule 45 to 47 um and uh this is a reaction that wasn't working particularly well but we have this this infrastructure in our lab of factor uh the software for for driving um high throughput experimentation we have the the actual uh physical hardware for for doing how to put experimentation um and uh and so rose couldn't get this reaction to work very well um using some you know some simple uh experiments so we we then ran one of these reaction screens where she takes uh the the two partners that need to be coupled together and look at different copper catalysts different ligands and additives and what rose found was that copper iodide um with uh this ligand l1 which is not shown here the structure of l1 is not shown here but it's it's a kind of sophisticated uh tetrazola ligand uh with with with no additive was actually the best um the best set of conditions and then and then she performs this reaction on on a traditional scale uh and and got a 66 isolated yield of that which was uh which was uh satisfactory for us to move forward on that so um so that's kind of our time together of uh of uh transmissions and conditions um i'll i'll quickly jump into some work that i did at merck uh before uh before joining michigan uh where we're looking at condition structure properties and function um and so here what we wanted to do was to uh to look at nanoscale synthesis and how it applies to biochemical function so uh you know we're running synthetic chemical reactions on 0.05 milligram scale super tiny scale for chemical synthesis but but a pretty decent size scale for biochemical analysis right so we were running these reactions and getting an lcms readout on whether the reaction worked yes or no but we realized there's plenty enough material in these reactions to also get a readout on if there is you know biochemical affinity of of the products of these to uh to various protein targets and so we used a technique called affinity selection mass spec um i won't get into it in detail today but um you can read about it uh here uh and um uh but we can feed our crude reaction mixtures 1500 reactions at a time into this asms assay and then do this affinity ranking experiment which again i'll skip the details of today to uh determine what is a good reaction what is a good reaction and a good binder to uh we looked at kinase proteins um and then what uh what i show here is just the fidelity between our um our super small scale reactions on the on the x-axis uh where the crude reaction is dosed directly into the biochemical assay uh in correlation to a traditional 50 micromolar scale purified reaction that is then uh then performed in a uh in a traditional uh ki assay with you know purified um reconstituted dmso stock solution um you can see that there's like pretty good fidelity between the two different techniques and so what this means is that we can get the same information on a super tiny scale uh but here we're tying together reaction conditions from the nanoscale synthesis all the way to different structures and properties and ultimately to their function in this case affinity to a kinase protein so i show that here um these are these are somewhat uh complex visualizations which i'll um i'll go through a little bit quickly as i've got just a minute or two left uh but um we ran 19 reactions and the 19 reactions are shown as the as the blue and yellow squares in this in this like one dimensional heat map um and then those reactions are then fed directly into this affinity ranking asms assay and what we're looking for is the yellow dots that go all the way down to the bottom um if they're down at the bottom that tells us it's going to be a potent compound um if they're if they if they're one of the purple dots up at the top then we then we then we uh would say that that's a low affinity compound and indeed we we run the reaction on uh on a traditional scale uh in this case isolating a 49 yield uh that gives us the 35 nanomolar compound uh which was the yellow dot circled in red here uh and then uh this other example we we run on a traditional scale purify the compound get a 38 yield uh that was the purple dot that's circled in right here and that is that is off uh you know off the charts that we we can't measure it so um so this is exciting for us right because now with 0.07 milligrams or sorry 0.7 milligrams of material uh we can get information about reaction conditions does the reaction work yes or no uh and we can get information about the function does the molecule bind to the to the uh protein that we care about um then we start to expand into more dimensions and so uh so what i'm showing here is uh is screening reaction conditions a bit more uh aggressively in the top panel we're looking at a suzuki coupling where we're looking at um 18 different coupling partners uh going from top to bottom and then eight different catalyst systems uh to try to find the right catalyst to connect these molecules together and then if the molecules connect together then we get to feed them into this assay uh and and you know hunt for the for the yellow dots uh in this case the yellow dot circle in red is this compound here at compound five which is 59 nanomolar so a pretty potent molecule uh compared to a impotent molecule compound six which is the purple dot here uh we did the same thing um with uh with this other series down below where again we're you know we're screening lots of different reaction conditions on super small scale 170 reactions are run with just nine milligrams of material uh we feed that directly into an assay uh we can we can separate out on a super small scale you know the the binder is the 23 nanomolar binders from the from the from the uh you know inactive compounds and uh if you're engaged at all in the design of molecules as a protein inhibitors then then you know hopefully you can appreciate why that would be a fun thing to do um and then we start to get kind of you know uh start having fun um with this um this is this is you know how i spent my paternity leave was teaching myself how to how to code with it with a baby in my lap um and and make fun visualizations like this uh and um and so what i'm showing you here is 3 000 reactions that were run on 123 milligrams of material and again we're looking for reaction conditions that'll give us the desired products and then uh and then feed us uh into this assay where the closer we get to the center of the circle the more potent the molecule could should be and so you can see that you know these amide uh coupled reagents uh bring us closer to the center of the circle and and so those are those are uh compounds that we would want to follow up on but if we look at this segment of the pie that says alcohol um most of this is up in the purple dot space meaning that most of these alcohol coupled products are inactive uh and we we don't need to spend more time there um and uh but but you know translating conditions to function is is is the point here right so what i'm showing you here uh is is a different visualization of that same library where we have uh we have uh a chemical space uh 384 compounds are shown in principal component analysis space um if you're not familiar with that that's fine just trust me that uh that each one of these yellow dots is meant to be a molecule if it's a yellow dot it means i got the molecule if it's a purple x it means i got a zero percent yield and i did not get the molecule so we run the reaction under a single uh condition a single reaction condition and a whole lot of these molecules are purple x's right so more than half of the molecules uh in the in this pi uh did not get made we got a zero percent yield we did not get to feed them into the assay we don't know if they're good molecules or not because we didn't get to make them uh instead we we then run four conditions because we have this ability to explore different um experimental dimensions uh using our high throughput experimentation techniques and we look at four catalysts and you see that we can turn on the vast majority of these molecules we can turn the purple x's into yellow dots and we get 92 percent of this molecule this library of of compounds gets made and then that tells us more about the the uh the chemical space but what's what's important here is you know here's like kind of one of these links between conditions and functions so the conditions uh uh under under panel a gave us a zero percent yield we explore different reaction conditions and we find we find the set that turns these molecules on um and then we feed that into the assay and we find these four molecules down below so these are four molecules that were a purple x on this side and they turn into a yellow dot on this side and these are all uh relatively potent molecules for this assay a 17 animal or compound is a pretty good compound and so these are compounds that would have been missed right that that like potent biochemical function um is intimately tied to this unique combination of t-butyl breadth foss mtbd and dms of solvent i mean that's like you know that's that's like a palladium catalyst that is now being tied to the function of this molecule and and i'm excited about you know how we can tie all these things together um and i'll just i'll quickly close out with that with one last vignette from our from our most recent nature paper um that that brings these four things together we have not yet brought all five of these together and that's that's what um we're very heavily involved in in our labs is tying together transformations condition structure and properties to ultimately drive function again my my goal is that we could have a palladium catalyst that sends a molecule to the liver uh and then a complementary copper catalyst that sends a molecule to the brain i think that that would be like a really a really cool thing to be able to control um and so i i i show you know a little bit of a prelude to to uh to getting there here so here are uh three sets of different uh molecule pairs where we take a complex molecule uh we click it together in in the amide format but also in in a non-amide format um and and get these different structures uh using different reaction conditions uh that that influence the uh the transformation and ultimately that gives us different properties and so um so here here are uh uh some of these property sets um for for uh complex molecule pairings um where there's this huge span of property space that one can access simply by changing the transformation and you can experimentally realize that by changing the conditions that changes the structure um and so there's this like this this deeply intertwined network of of transmission condition structure and properties that that is tied to function um and i am trying to understand you know how that how we can how we can study this at a systems level how this can how this can play together um again you know we're trying to learn from systems biology and the impact that uh that that has had but we are you know i'm a classically trained organic chemist i i don't really know very much about what systems biology is and i would really welcome uh any feedback um uh from uh from from this audience uh and uh and with that um i i i i want to thank uh my super talented group um i showed um uh work from from a number of them today uh and we have a number of great industrial sponsors who uh you know help pay the bills but also um uh you know make make uh doing this work fun um so with that um i will uh thank you and stop there and then um marcy or um aaron i don't know if um if we take questions or if anyone has questions um they're welcome to we have a few minutes left so feel free to unmute or in the chat box okay sounds good thank you so much for giving your talk that was excellent great we appreciate it thanks a lot take care
