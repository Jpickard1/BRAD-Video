pation in nerve um neural developmental disorders okay oh that's fine all right Thank You Ryan thank you so much for the invitation to speak I think it's been a great group it's been wonderful to talk to everybody over the last few days so what I thought I would do after talking to Ryan a little bit I understand you've had some technical talk and I thought maybe everybody was a little seminar weary and because of the group you know I think everybody here understands genomics exceptionally well so last night I pretty much took out all of the methods and tried to just give us a series of vignettes on some of the sort of translational and functional genomic studies that we've been doing and so we can talk methods you know in the end if anybody's interested but I thought I would talk about three things starting with the work that we've been doing for a long time on structural variation in neurodevelopmental disorders and just a short note on what we've been doing in prenatal Diagnostics then really talk about some of the more recent studies that we've been doing in functional functional genomic studies have really highly penetrant mutations in autism so you know we finally gotten to this point where we can start asking questions above these genes that we've been discovering cannot asthma neurodevelopmental disorders how can we really understand what they do and and can we find sort of convergent final pathways and which they affect and then finally engineering genomic disorders which is very new and we're just generating the data some of it literally just came off the machine a couple weeks ago so it's about half publish stuff and then the other half completely unpublished in and we'll see how it goes okay so genetic variation I'm gonna refer to autism more often than say more global neurodevelopmental disorders or congenital anomalies but really we study all of these what we know I think is it's pretty clear that common variation is the major contributor to the genetic architecture of autism although we've made very little progress in terms of finding actual common variants that are associated with the disorder where a single nucleotide variation from exome sequencing has been a sort of a boon of new discoveries in autism copy number variation has been studied for a very long time through chromosomal microarray and in fact at this point chromosomal microarray is the recommended first tier diagnostic screen for autism spectrum disorder and then there's balance rearranging so translocations inversion balance chromosomal abnormalities this has been almost entirely ignored in autism there are developmental disorders and really complex diseases more generally the methods and it's largely a technical barrier and that the methods are still to this day reliant on karyotyping is they have been about for the last 50 years or so other than new technologies for sequencing so a lot of my work is really focused on this group of the variants and the reason is that when you have a balanced rearrangement that occurred to novo you can disrupt an individual gene without complement and loss or a gain of genomic material such as what happens with CNB so you can narrow in on a single gene of interest in a given complex disorder that you really don't have the opportunity to do when you have large gains or losses in it okay so one of the questions we had it's really you know question is can we change the risk so what's behind this that you didn't see is you know in terms of a de novo carry type in a in a prenatal diagnostic setting say if you find it de novo translocation between the chromosomes on a karyotype you carry about a 6.1 percent risk of an untoward outcome and that risk estimate is based on cytogenetic studies done over 20 years ago and to this day that's still the risk estimate that we quote 6.1 percent of translocation 9.4% for de novo inversion it has nothing to do with the actual bands of the chromosome that are disrupted the genes that are disrupted or any information on basically what the risk estimate is so starting a several years ago when I was in but when I was a postdoc we have been sequencing these chromosomal abnormalities and asking the question of at sequence resolution can we improve that risk estimate and can we get to individual genes that might provide us more to me most of what I'm going to talk about is using large insert dumping libraries so I just want to describe them very quickly really they were they they had been around for quite some time and I think made popular by this original study by Mike Snyder's group with Yann Korbel we have been using them extensively the idea here is although genome sequencing has gotten cheaper it's the quite expensive to cover do you know man if you want to see points Truxel variation you really want a lot of coverage so here what we do is we take the genome and we share it up into very large fragments instead of small 200 base pair fragments we then add an adapter to the end that we ligate to the end of each of those segments and we just designed a stuffer so an internal biotinylated adapter and we can circularize the fragment off we can now share this circle go in and grab that stuffer and if we grab the junction site where we've actually done by sequencing into the ends of that junction fragment it's sequence a fragment that is separated by the size of a circle in our case usually we use three four five a B so we now generate short reads on the end of the sequence that are actually separated by three or four or five KB in the genome if we have a translocation or rearrangement we're then getting reads on each end of the fragment and we've now narrowed a rearrangement down to decides at the insert and depending on the coverage that we have we can narrowed even further the reason that I have really gravitated towards this method you could point mutations it's actually not very good for determining a lot of the genetic architecture of disease but you can go very deep and coverage of the genome by using the spatial relationship between the reads rather than relying on the actual nucleotide coverage okay so what have we learned from doing the sequencing I'll give you just two small hits of past studies and then get into what we've been doing um so one of the things we found out from the original study where we sequenced 52 subjects with balanced chromosomal abnormalities from karyotyping was that about 20% of all of these events are actually complex with three or more breakpoints and this was almost a tenfold increase over what had been estimated at cytogenetic resolution so it turns out that when we once thought were quite simple exchanges between the chromosomes are quite complex and in fact inversions are a pervasive feature of these we found cryptic inversions in 90% of the complex events that we detected so it led to this hypothesis that in fact inversions are mediating more complex rearrangements between a chromosome we also uncovered this this extremely complex set of rearrangements that they had been finding in cancer the time this was in 2009 when we first found this first one and and the folks at Sanger had just published on the side he had come with Crixus or chromosomes shattering and recombination and I was sitting on this data saying well I'm seeing this in these autism kids except it wasn't quite the same thing in the in the cancer genomes you saw this oscillation of gain and loss of copy number variation within the shattered region here in these children with autism what we're seeing is a serious igniculus ohms and within the chromosome Hubbert's result almost the perfectly balanced state so in this case you have about 23 and a half mega bases of the genome that's rearranged yet only about 5 KB of total genomic DNA gains are lost so it's completely cryptic or undetectable by any method identity okay so by using those methods what we were able to do is essentially take the balanced chromosomal rearrangements that we knew because we knew that they were going to be contributing to disease in a certain forth in the cases cuz they were de novo rearrangements in child with a phenotype we then sequenced them got to the breakpoints and in this one study we found a series of 33 genes that were disrupted by breakpoints from balance coma thermal abnormalities every one of these genes that are highlighted or bolded and italicized were actually new discoveries at the time that had not been associated with autism prior to that such a CH D 8 and due and Carol 3 we then went and tried to interpret these single unique genome right we have an end of one here so in fact quite a few of them could be red herrings we did that through convergent genomics we looked at gene expression we've built up quite a large CNB database of about 75,000 people at this point from diagnostic laboratories and controls so we looked for a burden of CNVs and in fact we associated genome-wide Association studies so what we were seeing was a an over-representation of common variants from genome-wide Association studies in autism and schizophrenia over the rare variant the genes that we were detecting by a by rare variation constructor it was also quite interesting that we saw this overlap in psychiatric disorders and children with neuro developmental abnormalities that were that disrupted the gene compared to psychiatric disorders when you saw this burden of common variation at the genes and I think one of the main things that we found where the individual gene contributed to the dénouement disorders so these were large segments of gains and losses of DNA that were previously for acute anomic disorders and we found is with a balanced rearrangement you can disrupt this one gene in that region and we capitulate much of that in fact okay so we've gone on and done this many times and this is some unpublished data we've sequenced 174 carry typical normalities at this point of doctrine sequence at this point its turns out that still 21.4 percent of them are complex rearrangements so clearly we're missing this with carry typing in the current standard of care and we actually find that the you know the the level of convergence in Domus is actually quite strong so it continues to turn out that when you have a de novo balanced large rearrangement of the genome the genes that are disrupted tend to be quite strongly enriched for causal factors in neurodevelopmental evidence one point I want to make in and this is what I'll get back to this in a second but in every one of the BCS we've sequenced to date I think at least it was displayed 150 I haven't gone back and looked again at least one breakpoint differed from the carry typical implication so of 174 cases with a karyotype ik rearrangement not once have we sequenced them and actually found both breakpoints so localize to exactly what was predicted by the karyotype it's always off by at least at something and in many cases a band or more I'll come back to that in a minute okay so what have we been doing since all right what happens if you don't have a karyotype what is the impact of structural variation in autism so this was a study that we started a few years ago right when the copy number variation work was being done in the Simon simplex collection which is a collection of idiopathic autism patients it's sporadic autism patients from trios so with parents and affected sibling there's actually quad for a lot of them an unaffected sibling and both exome sequencing and copy number variation was being done by chromosomal microarray we proposed to sequence Co bands we wanted to sequenced Rios but we couldn't funding to do it so we proposed the least sequence Pro bands with jumping libraries to ask the question of what is the structural variation landscape beyond just copy number variations so what do we see beyond this copy number very we wanted to really characterize the the full spectrum of structural variation in the autism Tina here's just a look at the overall metrics so you know this was the method I was describing this is the look at the coverage so on average we generated about a hundred x coverage of all of our library so I mean this is extensive coverage compared to say the thousand genomes right I'm completely amazed at Ryan and these folks were able with four X nucleotide coverage to get the results that they do so we generate a hundred x insert coverage you can see this is sort of the insert size distribution of the libraries they're right around 3.7 KB fairly tightly distributed between three and four and a half KT and so that's an important note so we have a threshold right so we have an insert size of three and a half maybe so say less than five KB we really can't tell the difference between a normal pair of a normal read and a delusion okay so I'm sorry did we could take this method slide up and fine so if we look at our jumping libraries you know we have developed a number of methods we use read-depth algorithms and clustering algorithms and a combination of a multiple clustering algorithms it was really the using the inserts with read depth at that I think has made the biggest improvement over just playing clustering like everybody else it's been looking at these things and so if we look at the arrays that have been run in the Simon simplex collectively I could be quite well at recovering what they find in anything above say 100 KB are 200 KB so in 40 kb we find all the deletions and even at 40 KT we pretty much hit most of the deletions and a high proportion of the insertions and our pipelines are pretty much tailored towards diagnostic work so you know we worry a lot about false negatives and you can see that you know potentially we're over calling by quite a bit so this is the proportion of the total variance that we call that are actually seen on the arrays is both of the portion of variance on a rate that we can pick up that or gold thinner to rate calls however we've gone on and now tried to validate we've been validating a lot lately and it turns out that you know somewhere around 85% of the things that we call as cnvs that the array miss to actually turn out to be valid so you know we're still missing a chunk of this but we are picking up a good bit and I think as we've all known the arrays turn out to be quite valuable and a number of places and of course then we're just below the resolution do you raise a number place okay so what have we been finding I think this is one of the more interesting things that we found from the the simplex collection and it is that there duplication signatures in the genome so as we were sequencing along and having the experience of chromothripsis already we were used to kind of putting together these complex rearrangements what we found is that a relatively high proportion of duplications in in the genome that were detected by array turned out to be fairly complex rearrangements and one of the more interesting classes that we found was this this signature of two duplications flanking and inversion and in fact we turned out that we found a number of duplication signatures that you can see in the genome and in fact you can pick up on arrays and we found them in diagnostic practice as well and I'll tell you those in a minute where essentially you have two duplications flanking a balanced inversion and we would call the Dubai Envy Duke it's similar but completely distinct from the Duke trip two variants that Tim ups key to describe from microwaves and done a lot of work on effectively what this is is two duplications in proximity to each other that flank and inversion and we found the signature in about any 9.6% of the autism programs we looked at and then if we consider other complicated duplication signatures we actually see them in twelve and a half percent of the autism subject so a significant proportion of autism subjects actually have the signature complex variation and as I said about 5.6 percent of all the duplications detected by chromosomal microarray turned out to be complex rearrangements so this is the signature that we find that turns out to be quite common and had not been described before from population-based sequencing studies but effectively what you get is two duplications in proximity inversion in between them so you end up with in a head to tail duplication signature a tail to tail duplication signature in a large inversion and you can see this is a microarray you clearly got the two duplications but when you obviously can't see is the inversion in the middle we have gone back to a large number of micro rates and and looked at them and this signature actually popped up quite a bit in different samples where you get two duplications in proximity each other of course they're just interpreted at the nine duplications and they can be small they can be large but what's missed is the fact that they're actually underlying a quite large inversion so we published the first one of these in a study we did on early onset neuropsychiatric disorders where we saw this Duke inversion signature to actually disrupted a gene what was interesting about it is when we went to clinical diagnostic array data what we found is this duplication signature was present in this number of cases so it I mean it's rare it's something like 0.1% of cases but you can clearly see this duplication signature on diagnostic arrays so basically anybody who has an array study go look at your arrays and and I am quite sure you will see this kind of a pattern in a certain number of your cases okay what else did we find well we found these dupe signatures that actually also underlie clearly pathogenic events this is a de novo large Perry centric inversion that disrupt socks - but the micro the chromosomal microwave pattern actually was just too benign small duplication on the chromosome and yet we know it's - is the pathogenic local in autism we saw other signatures that look like paired Duke signatures but in fact they involve three duplications with inversion in the middle duplication with deletion and inversion and even a duplication with a nested deletion so if a sequence is duplicated then you have a nested deletion you in fact go from copy number to 3 copy number to copy number 3 and the the middle portion actually does not involve any gain or loss of material okay so in summary of these really complex duplications where we're characterizing the break points and we're pretty much done with them but we you know a large portion of the michael knowledge mediated you might have guessed this is just some sort of microbiology mediated template switching I had a good time talking to Tom bloggers today and then thinking about this we see insertions at the breakpoint a huge number of times again suggesting some sort of templates what's what's happening we find gene fusions predicted gene fusions only 90% of time in fact hemizygous atima gene only 9% of time more often than not the gene is simply duplicated and that makes the interpretation of this disruption in the disease quite hard because you can imagine you can have the gene inverted and duplicated but the entire team is duplicated you actually haven't been roughly the message we've just gotten another copy of it I'm like the Ox - which was disruptive okay so in autism and and missus please don't hold me to this this is sort of our working are working numbers and and they're yet to be explained but I think this is really to take home is we know the common variation it's going to be a major component of the disorder and and Bernie Devlin has done some nice work with a lark conclusion to it so that maybe it's around forty nine fifty percent while the de novo exome variation has certainly gotten a lot of attention have been remarkably helpful for us to characterize the disorder you know best estimate there may be two count the five percent of cases that have an oval Asif unka mutation in the Simon's collection and this number of six point seven percent so we think that somewhat you know it might be somewhere around fifty percent we're not done with the validation we don't have all of the the you know inherited status probably so so please don't hold me to this but at this point our estimates are around fifteen percent of the the etiology is due to structural variation in the Simon's collection and again these are sporadic they tend to be less severely affected than some other populations particularly populations that go into clinical diagnostic laboratories that might have a higher burden of intellectual disability the arrays actually picked up about six point seven percent so we think this is almost doubling the heal to be erased by simply looking at small variants that are below erased resolution or these kind of complex rearrangements so we think this was sort of a useful strategy we want to now do much larger scale trio analyses but effectively what we see is small deletions we actually found reciprocal translocations we found those complex rearrangements I told you about we've actually found chromothripsis in the sample but absent any carry tipic abnormality so very small variance moving around we see insertions into genes and then small cryptic sandy's although we're missed by previous characterizations by micro nain exome so if you kind of extend this thought into into the clinic you know you can make the assumption that is we push exome sequencing and we push microwave we're still missing a certain proportion of the united variants that is quite detectable without technology late okay so that transitions into genetic diagnostics and I'll keep an eye on time I believe okay I couldn't just kind of handle a couple of things but okay genetic diagnostic so I don't want to belabor this too much because this is old and we're talking about dinner actually last night but you know we had C points all these genomes and yet you know this paper was won and yet it became you know publication simply because of who it was so this was a case that had multiple congenital anomalies and a translocation that came into the clinic and based on the methods we developed they asked if he could do you want a research basis so they signed in a research study if we could provide a prenatal diagnosis of the case based on having a karyotype so we developed our pipeline to we basically just flicked the pipeline down into a two-week turnaround where we were able to make jumping libraries do the sequencing for our computational pipelines at it and and Sanger sequence within two weeks and what we found was the translocation actually disrupted a known cause of locus c87 which is the positive charge syndrome so this child obviously went from a 6.1 percent risk of an untoward outcome based on no knowledge of the breakpoints to you know a very very highly penetrant locals that have actually disrupted we made a predictive diagnosis to charge syndrome at birth the clinical diagnosis with charts and jilma this case and unfortunately child passed away at ten days of a very severe form of charge which is everybody probably no charges a multi-system developmental abnormality that involves cardiac defects and intellectual disability and a number of other defects including and understanded testes which they were able to pick up at 32 weeks on the ultrasound but you wouldn't be able to pick up at 12 weeks when they originally did the ultrasound and found the cardiac inside so we have gone on in doneness that was the original case we have gone on and done this a number of times in the clinic and in in in concert with the clinicians and the clinic I'm going to tell you about just one of the series of I think ten we've done so far and it's because it's sort of an interesting case and it feeds into to some of the mental work we've been doing and we haven't published any of this but this was a case where at i/o dot a carry type of an inversion of chromosome eight and it happened to be a quite savvy mother and she's asked us to tell the story so we tell it that had seen me give a talk at a meeting and she was given a risk of 6.1% based them into no von bergen and you know she has clearly said that she would risk averse and was likely to terminate the pregnancy but had seen that she knew that we would be able to seek when it fits well so she wanted this done so you know on a research basis the sequencing was done we found an inversion that disrupted this gene HDR bs3 it's an RNA binding protein it's involved in alternative splicing seems like something you should probably have two copies of in the genome and yet through our conversion genomics you know we saw deletions of the Fenian controls we saw a series of disruptions of the gene in exome cases and so our interpretation was absolutely a variant of unknown significance certainly we weren't increasing that risk beyond what what it would have been otherwise and so she changed her mind and decided to go forward with a pregnancy based on these results and you can make your own interpretation on on that decision but about a year ago now Julianne was born and he's perfectly happy and healthy and he's home and the mom was given a number of testimonials and run through these processes on how this sort of influenced her decision in the counseling realm from a research standpoint you know the question is well I guess first of all from a clinical standpoint you know the question that we used to ask this can we do this and clearly yes and in fact just a month or two ago we did one in a week so we had a seven day turnaround from a karyotype to a a breakpoint sequence and then the question of course comes up and this has been really widely debated in diagnostic practice in general and create prenatal diagnostics more more specifically is you know should we do and I think is a conservative reflux test at least the conventional cytogenetics it offers superior resolution to make a clinical medical decision and I think the key point that that I'm sort of stuck on is that medical decisions are being made every day right now with incorrect information so I just told you that every karyotype that's ever been given to a mother is you know most likely off by a sub man or at least the one could be sequenced so far so at the very least at least we're giving them the information of where these breakpoints actually occur and then the risks that comes with that of course everybody in Pacific so the point of telling you this though is to tell you about the experimental stuff that we've been doing in cell-free fetal DNA sequencing I don't know if you guys the third bacon kids min but he wrote one of the really fantastic papers on this yeah no I knew Jacob and he actually helped but you know there was all this great work going on and non-invasive prenatal sequencing Jacob in NJ and those folks had narrowed down the point mutations and looked at the exomes and done HAP was like haplotype resolved work in a trio what we wanted to do nobody even still although there was one translocation detected by it by a company but in general nobody had looked at small CNB's and certainly not a balanced rearrangement himself repeated DNA so the idea of self repeatable unites everybody familiar with this you have DNA circulating in the bloodstream of the mother from the fetus and so he can take that fat DNA circulating in the bloodstream there's small shards of DNA you can sequence it and you can basically do a pre diagnosis if you have a copy number abnormality but specifically an aneuploidy without doing an invasive test so when it's really useful for those types on the 21 and Beyond trisomy 21 you know it's it's it's sensitivity and specificity positive predictive value it's all over the place and if it's not in anybody it's very hard it's not actually all that useful well I just showed you that a huge portion of autism and other abnormalities had nothing to do trisomy Tzar aneuploidy they have to do with much smaller barrier so we asked the question of could we find this inversion so basically Jacob and Jason cherry made a library for us a few years ago now and we sequenced it extremely deep we generated 1.7 billion reads we got 52.6 ex haploid coverage now effectively to the circulating cell-free fetal DNA is a mosaic of the mother and the child so what this ends up being is 38 X coverage when we sequence the small charge and a 24% fetal DNA and so about a quarter of the reads come from the fetus 75% of we come along so we then went asked ourselves can we find this chromosomal rearrangement just from the circulating DNA in the fetus and the answer is yes you can and the only reason that this hasn't been a white bear test in gnomic systems we can't really so we flew all of our methods at it the jumping library jump right over the breakpoint quite nicely so you know we get 68 reads on one chromosome on one end and and 37 leaves on the other but it turns out it's sitting right on a line element and so no matter how deeply you sequence this cell free fetal DNA and try to align these small up to 140 base pair fragments you never got a clean split that we could pick out sitting on the line on one side now if we go in a definitive program to grab every read in the in the and the past queue file because we know it's sitting there we pull them out so they're in there but there was no way we could actually find this so I mean out of out of an abundance of caution we didn't publish this and we still haven't published it because I well it's a positive finding there's no way we could have actually done this flight and and nobody has done it blindly since so I think this is a real talent so what we are doing though is we've now really generated a large number of jumping libraries on the mother we have the father extremely deep coverage and we have the probe and deep and jumping libraries that's what we're trying to do now is characterize what stuff so very few family finds itself if it'll be enough you know at least what proportion of its dark ovarian spectrum wouldn't we be able to find some circulating DNA and the mother that could obviate the need for invasive high-risk clinical testing during pregnancies okay so that's the end of the structural variant stuff what I wanted to do was talk a little bit about functional genomics now and some of the work that we've been doing that I'm pretty excited about in terms of characterizing these variants so I'll tell you the story about one Jean CH da this was one of those 33 teams will be found it's actually interesting it was a gene that was in a micro deletion syndrome and a couple years before we found it by our translocation it was you know there were a number of genes in this micro deletion syndrome it's a fairly rare micro deletion syndrome sea state was one of them so we hit it by a translocation somewhere around 2009 and it was just one of this pile of genes that you know meant nothing there was almost nothing published on it in terms of disease association and it was this end of one which is the problem with sequencing a genome if you don't know much about that being disrupted since then of course there's been an explosion of papers in autism all in which was effectively replicated CHD 8 it's one of the most penetrant de novo loss of function mutations of cj's one of most pen include cognitive ocular much more recently there was a study of tumor types 21 different tumor types from exome sequencing from the broad and others and they actually found CHD 8 as one of the genes disrupted in a pan-cancer analysis from mosaic loss of function mutation so and there have been a couple of other papers suggesting perhaps a role for chroma domain HeLa cases in general and CHD specifically in cancer okay so the the point of this study was alright so we had this gene that we knew was fairly penofin and the the exone studies that had been published particularly one you know was really pushing these these pathways and networks that the genes that harbored de novo loss of function mutations were part of and these are from curated PPIs and the networks are fine and n and their thinness is something that it is the beta Catina network and then this pathway leads autism from there the only problem is I mean this is all predictive right it we don't actually know what happens when you knock down to 88 so what we wanted to do was really try to preserve the network of genes that are regulated by CH deed and see what actually comes out at the end so we designed a study where we had the CH d8 we had IPS derived neural progenitor cells so early neural precursors and what we wanted to do was knock down CH D expression and early neuro precursors from a control with an isogenic background generate allelic series we did this a large number of times because we did transcriptome profiling and of course noise and you really need to model variants because more than anybody we also did a seed zebrafish study because one of the main phenotypes have come out of the paper date on safety a disruption is back ok so this was the study that we did this is a look at the series of shrnas we use so we got a little obsessive over this we actually use six independent shrnas to knock down the genes six different ways and six different lines we did it all in duplicate we took one of the shrnas and ran it again so we actually had this one it's implicit we then took shrnas targeting genes that aren't in the genome and ran those from duplicate as comparisons with the native line we had the shrna treated line and then we had the troll lines this is the level knockdown that we observe so clearly work in a range from 40% to 70% exactly we would expect and hemizygous individual with the loss of function mutation and then when we actually look at the protein levels we see that they've done down just as we would predicted okay so what did we find well you know one of the the debates about CH da it's a chroma domain helicase it models chromatin and it was thought to have repressive functions and yet there were there was also this other literature or on activating functions and you know that's very much what we see so if we look at the T nomen and the results I'm gonna show you this is that a nominal P 0.05 if we go down to aq of 0.01 0.001 they actually the patterns hold the same so I'm just showing you a larger floppy gene but basically the functions of CHD 8 seem to be more repressive than activating so you see more genes go up when you knock down cata then you see go down fine the pathways that you looked at across all the differentially expressed genes have pretty much nothing to do with narrow development so here's a gene that we know contributes autism if you have loss of function yet we have pathways that aren't all that related to neuro development but it turns out if you look at the upregulated and downregulated genes all the down regulated genes are related cell adhesion synapse formation axon guidance neuron differentiation all the pathways that we had been searching for in autism and neurodevelopmental disorders the genes that were upregulated were more to do with kind of transcriptional regulation and cell cycle maintenance we did see an association of intellectual disability genes in that group but in general we asked the collection then and you know of these seemed to go up in genes that go down what does the autism profile look like among those things that are regulated is it the case but actually see hd8 regulates a large number of autism genes and that's why we see this this association and in fact if we take the genes that have been curated there's some 728 genes that have been curated by the Simons Foundation thoughts and researches having been implicated one way or another in autism it's a very broad set of genes it's not terribly specific but we just asked a very broad question is are those genes associated with CHD a gene expression it turns out if you look at the up regulated genes or not at all if you look at a reduced set of genes that have stronger evidence they're not at all but if you look at a broad set of TCGA cancer genes and this is 6,000 genes have been implicated cancer in any way shape or form again not very specific you actually see a quite significant enrichment among upregulated yet if you look at those down regulated genes you see a really strong enrichment of autism genes and not cancer so there actually seems to be the specific enrichment of genes depending on the repressive or activating function of CHD eight we then looked at chip seek so we took antibodies and did chip see chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing we use three independent antibodies and only looked at the peaks in which each antibody was bound to a region in the genome and we got a queue less than 0.05 on on our tip seekpeek analysis so this is really a very tight set of genes they're replicated three times with three independent antibodies and what we find overall is an enrichment for CHD a binding site in the upstream link and the gene near the transcription start site in fact if we look at the epigenetic roadmap data there's a very very strong enrichment for active transcriptional start site for zhkp so we press a function activating function where it binds all of this certainly suggests that a large number of genes in the genome have some CA play some role in activating or repressing them you know that role based on whether if the regulatory role that a plays might be fishy specific but CH day clearly binds to a large number of even if you know and all three antibodies would actually see 7300 Peaks if we look at any one antibody we see about 1,200 peaks and this result was replicated by Jim Noonan group in different cell types so I'm telling you this because I want to give you some insight into what happens when we integrate data set when we integrate functional genomics data sets so I just told you about the teams that went up and down well what happens when we put the chip seek data so what if you're bound by C 88 so these genes up here are indirectly down regulated by th day because they had they're not bound at all by C these genes are indirectly up regulated these genes are directly regulated and these two corners and then these genes are bound by CH safe but not regulated at all and then here's a list of all those see if they thought well it turns out that if we look at cancer be at the TCGA cancer set or this more restricted set of genes that had de novo somatic mutations from Lawrence at all more recently or a cosmic cancer set that includes month point mutations and CNB's they're all statistically significant in genes bound by C hd8 but not genes regulated by C 88 indirectly and in fact if you just look at the binding sites of TCGA result so extremely significant as our the point mutation none of the autism sets are significant in the ASD bound genes if you consider those Safari genes I told you about but there's one thing that's special about the Safari genes and that they weren't just discovered by genetic variation they were also discovered by neurobiological hypotheses and functional studies so genes involved in synaptic formation and and and that were studied based strictly under a biological hypothesis and in model systems are also included in that set and in fact when you look at the indirectly downregulated genes they're not bound by say hd8 that's where that signal was coming from on the other hand if you look at genes that were disrupted from the Novo loss of function mutation studies in autism they're actually enriched among the cd8 binding sites so these are two different sets of genes that are both implicated from in autism by CH da and it depends on how you look at CH d8 in the the pathways that came out of the initial exome sequencing studies were chromatin modification transcriptional regulation and synaptic regulation it looks like CG touches each of those pathways but in very different ways in its regulation and the reason this is important is if we then go look at brain span data so this is co-expression module this is gene expression data across developmental timing from prenatal - it's a postnatal and work done in papers published in sell last year showed that in fact there are co-expression modules of genes that are strongly enriched at various developmental time points and one of the strongest in which time points was early neuronal development when you had the de novo loss-of-function mutations there were much of the chromatin modifiers and in fact what we find is the genes that are bound by CH d8 are strongly enriched in exactly those same time point whereas the other set of genes that are indirectly down regulated by CH d8 and associated with neuronal differentiation and synaptic formation are actually associated to quote special modules that were found later in development and if we lay our CT data over a second study that did the same thing in brain span we find the exact same pattern so what we find is this sort of master regulator of many many different genes actually touches on a number of different pathways that have been associated with autism neuro development and we weren't able to sort of tease those apart until we actually looked at the integration of multiple different functional genomic data types so just the zebrafish I'll tell you quickly had macro couple of that and um Evan Eichler had done a study where they actually looked at patients with microcephaly and found the exact same thing microcephaly with one of the strongest Association from our tips Takeda so this suggests both model organisms and IPS derive cellular model point us towards pathways that are very important in autism from one strong effect and that's exactly what Ilya is the developmental timing whether it's ch d8 is actively regulating a gene or indirectly regulating if he may be differentially influenced in the pathways that are implicated may be different orientation influenced or not okay so the last 15 minutes I will show you something totally new that we've been doing and this is using genome engineering methods to derive genomic disorders and I think this is something that it's been fun in the lab so we had done some studies similar to the CH da work where we did RNA sequencing of 16 p11 microdeletion simple so genomic disorders are are you know among the most common causes of autism and neurodevelopmental advent they are recurrent CNVs copy number variants both deletion and duplication where they are gains and losses mediated by the allelic architecture of the region which is segmental duplications flanking the gain or loss genic region so sixteen p11 is one of the most common ones it's been associated with a number of different disorders and you have 29 teams here in the Phoenix in and 10 genes here in these segmental duplications in which you have to be popular so of course the mechanism is a miss pairing of these segmental duplications so you either end up with a loss of the Teaneck segment and one segmental duplication or a duplication of the region and a duplication one segment so the the problem with nhr mediated rearrangements is although they occur most common the most common class of copy number variants they have recurrent breakpoints so you can't actually get to the individual driver genes within the region and yet despite the recurrent breakpoint 216 p11 this is one of the most heterogeneous phenotypes that we have with strong effect genes in neuro development in fact it's been associated with no developmental abnormalities autism schizophrenia other neuropsychiatric disorders as well as BMI obesity and very Santa symmetric trait we did some work in a zebrafish in a paper published in Nature a couple years ago with Niko Katz anise where they knocked down every gene in the region and zebrafish and found a strong effect driver of narrow and comical phenotypes but we wanted to ask the question genome-wide what does the transcript don't look like associated with a CMV and so we did RNA seek on a series of multiplex families with deletion or duplication of a 60 p1 one region we also looked at Mouse cortex of a that has pollution or duplication of the synthetic seventh qf3 region that was created by Ilya Mills I focusing Harbor and I just basically give you the the overview of this because it's just a intro into the crisper work but effectively what we find is if you have a deletion or duplication and an NH are mediated region we find no dosage compensation whatsoever so in 16 p11 if you're deleted all the genes go down and could duplicated all the teams go up maybe that's not surprising to most of you we actually were hoping to find some billeted compensation and prep pull out some of the genes in the region and we couldn't do that at all and in fact the segmental duplications behave fairly well as well when we look to non wide at the transcriptome we found a number of signals but basically what we found is the genes within a C and V region are the most significant gene by far in the genome so the genes that are actually directly implicated by the cnv in both mouse and human are by far the strongest signals in the genome and you know it's a little unfortunate because one of the things we would have liked to seen was a number of loci that had actually strong regulatory effects if you don't see that I think you know this is a little bit underpowered and we want to do this on a much larger scale but the one interpretation that you might take from this is the effect size really has a ceiling genome-wide on kind of the regulation that a given C env can't have one interesting thing we found was positional effects and I think this is interesting because of the it might have an impact on sort of nuclear architecture and physical interactions between the chromosome and in fact what you see is okay so if you take the the genome and pin it up into all possible 1 Meg bins then ask that we have an enrichment of differentially expressed genes in any of those bins compared to elsewhere in the genome the region itself implicated by the cnv is by far the strongest in both mouse and human however among the most significant bins on the end of the distribution is the 16 P distal region so just distilled of 60 P 1 1 micro deletion syndrome if you don't look in mouth you see the exact same region is actually participate significantly enriched with differentially expecting but the proximal region isn't at all it's like smack-dab in the middle of the distribution of the entire genome so you have one side of the cnv that's enriched for differentially expressed genes and the other side of the CMV that isn't at all our colleagues at at loosen University Alexander Raymond and his lab have now explored this and they have microarray data and we've replicated each other's datasets on this and effectively what happens is if you nuke or CC and you you use the focal point of 16 P the 16 P 11.2 region to 600 KB region or this 220 kV region that has a distal 16 people on one point you see in recent film that's been associated but it's much more rare it turns out that there's quite a few physical interactions between these two regions of course they're in close proximity to each other anyways but it turns out that each of the genes and I'm showing two here but there's actually quite a few others that have a physical interaction or actually differentially expressed in our analysis if you then go genome-wide and look at some of those bins that were on the significant end of the distribution of significant bins genome-wide that seem to be regulated in trans and you overlay hi-c data on its genome-wide there were a number of Peaks where you actually found a binned it was differentially expressed and you also found a high CP suggesting that they're in close proximity to tomecek CP 1 1 so these data suggest and there's a lot more work to be done here at much higher resolution that perhaps the gain or loss of the region actually leads to a shift in the positioning of the chromosomes and could lead to physical positional effects both consistent in France okay finally the convergence on common pathway so I showed you to see HD 8 data a number of other teams have been associated with autism have converged on those same pathways and then when we look at the Mouse cortex what we see is cell adhesion regulation of transcription and neuronal differentiation and those are the exact same genes that have come out of the autism exome sequencing studies and they're the exact same network pathways that I just told you about in our CHD 8 study so I think at least early on you know in a field to where we had very little to hold on to for quite a long time in terms of you know bonafide causal factors in autism where we're starting to make some serious progress in terms of genes pathways and networks and how they're regulated and how they may influence developmental time so what we then wanted to do was ask the question okay we have these 60 cnvs can we model them you know it's not ideal to have patients with different genetic backgrounds one at a time and we have to get political tissue and we have to look at lymphoblastoid cell lines and it turns out that the liver blood cell lines only Express about 60% of the genes are interested in autism we're at the neural progenitor cells and the mouse cortex had eighty to ninety two percent of the genes so we wanted to know when we model micro deletion syndromes and if we create them in a day so we had done a series of genome editing studies with forecast nine I'm assuming everybody knows about Chris birth and Cassadine the ideas we design a guide RNA targeted to the genome would use a cast iron endonuclease create a double strand break you rely on non-homologous repair repair that break in a certain percent the time that will go wrong and leave you with a small in Dell or a point mutation so this has been used extensively varying five okay yeah so it's been used generally for single guide RNAs didn't use point mutations so in fact the idea is you have a guide RNA a target to site do you don't have past nine you end up it meets the non homologous pair you end up with a small in Dell or single nucleotide transition and version we've also done some studies there have been other studies in the field then we just completed one where we show that you can actually create larger rearrangements using a dual guide method and which we target to different regions they simultaneously cut the DNA we did not homologous repair between sites and you get a deletion we have actually done we did a study where we sequenced the whole genome we did another study where we did targeted analyses and it turns out that this is a fairly efficient process so up to depending on the guide RNA that we chose somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of the time we could actually make a deletion 3% at a time what we actually made was an inversion so just by using a dual gun I took up a slight penis but just by using a dual guy cut site 3% at a time you actually get an inversion of the region between the two guys and in fact we induce translocations a small number of times as well and we figured this out by sequence and he did targeted sequencing to 3300 X coverage so every nucleotide in the on target not target site we see plenty almost over 3,000 times so we can kind of count every molecule that was disrupted and turned out to be quite interesting you also get the point mutations and you expect a single guys so when you treat something with a dual guy kind of the idea is anything that can't happen does happen when when the when the genomes course to repair itself get all kinds of funky really so knowing that we wanted to ask the question can we actually use this for sixteen p11 and genomic disorders more generally it just will be understood sixteen p11 and had all the data port anyway and so this is data that it just kind of come off the sequencer within the last couple of weeks but effectively we wanted to model this in IPS cells and then differentiate those the different types of cells we tried the dual guide strategy where okay you have these segmental duplications right so remember we have these two segmental duplication and if you put CRISPR to the unique regions within them you can probably induce a deletion between those those two segmental duplications so we designed one guide RNA to this region we design one guide RNA to this region their unique guide RNA tailing blast one place in the genome the idea being you can then come in and cut them and we did a deletion of the unique sequence but that's not actually what happens in vivo right it's a miss paring and you actually needed gain or loss of one of the segmental duplications so an ideal model would be to take out the the genic region as well as the segmental duplication and that would be a recapitulation of the invivo model so did identify you know we used the degenerate blast against segmental duplications came up with one region that would target each segmental duplications but nowhere else in the genome and the idea would be that we would cut the segmental duplication instead of non-homologous repair we would induce ology mediated repair just as occurs in vivo so we had this sort of debate among us I had no doubt that this duel guide approach would work we know we had already seen it work a bunch of time the idea is we would generate basically a 575 KB deletion of the internal region leave the seg dupes intact it's not ideal but it's pretty good and I thought we could do it we weren't sure if we could do the this method where we would actually target the seg dupes and get them to reconvene on their own but if we could then we would be left with a 740 Kb deletion as well as one copy of the seg dukes would be taken out and we would have one copy of those genes one of the investigators on our collaborative team actually bet me that we would make duplications as well and this is actually what occurs in the cell right you get a miss pairing in a deletion or duplication I didn't think that was going to happen but the only one way to find out so we did the experiments basically designed the CRISPR we targeted the seg do we actually did fact sorting after we generated the CRISPR treatment so that we could get to single cells because we didn't want a heterogeneous population cells we have we're in the middle of doing genome-wide copy number analysis but we have looked at the region itself with a qpcr and then we've now done genome-wide RNAi see okay so here's what we got the 575 KB deletion that we tried worked and a 720 kb deletion one here is the control line this is a copy number this is a cue PCR analysis this is the native line this is a patient with a 16 p1 one deletion this is a patient with a 16 p1 one duplication this is the 575 KB and the 740 KB deletion and in fact we did end up making duplication and this occurred pretty frequently so 13% at a time we add what we were able to get nhr mediated deletion 4.3 percent of the time we're actually able to generate nhr mediated duplication when we then went and looked at this genome-wide we had all this RNA seek data and in and bibo so we looked at our models will generate an RNA seek study in which we did the the CRISPR induced deletions and duplications the native control lines control lines treated with casts 9 and not a guide RNA to see what the casts 9 treatment might do and then we looked at patients so we had deletions and duplications and patient lines we did RNA seek across the genome this is a look at the chromosome 16 region and what you see as it turned out quite nicely so all the deletions cluster together they cluster with the patients and the families cluster together but the 740 KB deletions in the 575 KB deletions also cluster together all the controlled cluster together and with the normal mother and all the duplication when we look at the region itself it looks exactly like I had shown you that the the invivo state look like 60 all the deletions go down this is RNA seek data all the duplications go up and within the segmental duplication the duplication throw up the deletions go down and the 575 KB deletion to stuff basically all the genes within the region and none of the deeds within so it looks like we have actually induced nhr mediated repair they're disrupted one set of genes and segmental duplications and a genic region itself and this is a look at the teams but then the segmental duplication and there's actually when you normalize them to the patient it looks like the patients are a little higher but you absolutely get deletion and you get duplication and the CRISPR models that match the patient line quite nicely so if we don't think about that genome-wide the picture that we got from the human 16 p11 we've done the same analyses in the crisper and we get the exact same result again underpowered we don't have that many samples but effectively what we see is 60 p1 one deletion is again significantly in the genome so this clearly has work it's worked in the number of cells that we've looked at and we can then model it for physical analyses and we you know we're now moving on but we think that this is basically a model that can work for all microdeletion and micro duplication syndrome so we think we can now model an HR mediated rearrangements in addition IPS lines and then differentiate those into all the lines that we might be interested in moving forward okay so conclusion cryptic and complex structural variations are a component of etiology of ASD they they're not and explain all but they certainly do have a role in autism and neurodevelopmental disorders I think whole genome sequencing can really provide a high resolution reflex test conventional diagnostic methods there there's a lot of debate and how pervasive sequencing should be in Diagnostics and that's a big debate I'm saying on a very small debate I think this offers a high resolution option for particularly for pregnancies and what we can give them the exact breakpoint and then those decisions to be made that and finally nhr mediated genomic disorders can really be modeled by careful targeting inside mental duplications and I think there's the opportunity to model structural variation more broadly you need you know my so thanks for your time I think we finished on time and these are the folks in my lab that did all the work is it it's a few collaborators there's many many more that I wasn't able to have to take anybody please doesn't speculate again yeah no it's a it's it's a great question my guess the guess is that in the Simon simplex collection is actually a low proportion of cases compared to say if you had a sample loaded with intellectual disability in general anomalies or dismorphism and I'm guessing that because you know where we see 15 to 22 percent CMV burden in general cases that come in for neurodevelopmental dude a nerd about mental disorder for microarray testing in the Simon's collection we're very careful microwave was done in the entire family and the sibling you only see a burden of about 6.7% so I think this is and this has been widely debated in the assignments of bucks but I'm not telling you anything that other people haven't discussed which is that you know we think there may be some ascertaining for less severe cases in this collection and I think the genetics of burying that outcome of that so my guess would be that it actually is a little higher than mobile condition structural variation mode and more severe neurodevelopmental the but wouldn't it's good to friend Ian and and other neuropsychiatric disorders I bet it'd be more yep right yeah no good schizophrenia I'm guessing it's been below and we do know that the C and B if we follow CNB's and I think the complex stuff I'm probably a good parallel for the CMB you know the burden flow in spending in bipolar disorder and ADHD but if there it's if it's non it's significant non-trivial its component the etiology but not as strong I think that's gonna follow but again that's a division next couple years I think yes just curious so I have not dug data I mean I know it and in general it's it's fairly stable but does bounce around I I don't know specifically China doctor question I know schizophrenia is extremely stable across population the the incidence of comorbid affective disorders and mood disorders bounces around quite significantly and and you know there's always been debate whether that was really a diagnostic and so for example in the u.s. it was the last time as I looked at somewhere about 30% of cases with schizophrenia had a comb or the new disorder and yet in India was in fact 3% in and then so that seems to be a diagnostic thing based on the studies that have been done autism I I can't say for sure between China and the US I know that the the prevalence has been rising you know everybody knows this in the US and other developed countries I probably can't speak but it certainly dependence is going up yeah now we have entirely safe very much thank sure but there are people doing that yeah I can tell you very absolute very interested and correlating Connecticut with some of the phenotypic features my lab I'm sorry I just to follow up that question that is the famous part of the famine in China where there is an increase in schizophrenia and on women who were pregnant and so that most of the goddesses had spontaneous abortions because the starvation was so profound but the ones who did it that might be a very interesting for you to really understand perhaps the stage and the environment right so it's a friend I have no idea about exactly the thing about autism you know the heritability is fairly high of the component that we've shown these are de novo what we are finding so far with the tools that we have right which is almost certainly picking off the lowest hanging fruit and not a major component of the thorn I think that's what all the research shows so far you know these are de novo loss-of-function mutations of these really sort of important genes chromatin modifiers a transcriptional regulator it control the regulation of all these other needs amid you know I suspect and again this is a little bit of speculation but based on the way I just showed you with the developmental timing and how they're you know extremely early in development I mean when they're not motile Express I suspect those are just really severe cases that the environment if you're necessarily going to be terribly influential but as I showed you that donut it doesn't explain that much of the variance so I do think there are these other components that could be quite important and you know we haven't been cited but at some point that what's the path for people low-hanging fruit no it would I think well I think that's part no it's fine it's because I went through like a hundred thousand five sixty Seconds so that was really the point of be spent they would publicly sell a couple years ago or I'm playing just last year but basically this data is basically and and and that's it's just the beginning of your you know so I think you're asking a very big question this is a small component of it and but basically you know what they were finding is you can track gene expression signature along developmental timing from kind of very early postnatal and in different in different brain regions right the gene expression signatures and we shouldn't overstate this because there's a lot of genes that are s the entire way right but the gene expression the Co expression of genes did differ and when they differed the genes that had been associated with oxygen by Canova loss of function mutation were more likely to be in variable expression blocks and the chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators were more likely to be and so that's kind of what this is getting at it both you know highly regulatory genes were more likely to occur early in development and when we looked at our CTA gene the ones that CH they found were also more likely to be in these Pokemon so it's certainly it's a you know and this is the effect size I'm filling with I guess I didn't explain before but it doesn't you know it's it doesn't explain everything but it is certainly in Richmond where's the genes that were involved in cell adhesion synaptic plasticity were a little later in development and and you know if you wanted to spitball hypotheses perhaps those are the ones that we should be targeting for kind of you know therapeutic because it might be that these early one things have gone pretty bad pretty early but later on you know it'll feel infection and so I think people are trying to get at that and you know that's one of the purposes for going back and we finding these patients that have these mutations get exactly no one supposed to think about people maybe he's a disease but what's going on with a large number of bound but non non regulated I mean it looked like the number was much greater than right so and this is replicated so this is nothing else I told you is true this one is that it basically even in kind of three antibodies and our study and then Junoon and he looked at mouse brain and embryonic stem cells we are looking at RNA seeking one tissue though right so it could you know this is a chromatin modifier chromatin being involved in chromatin it may absolutely be that regulatory and other tissues and if we did RNA seek and a bunch of different issues we would find different team turning on and off that it's bouncy but it's absolutely the case that a small portion of the genes that it found to in this study again they might be power thick and all that you know are differentially expressed when you knock it down perhaps that was a an expected outcome looking back on it although we didn't think it going in because there's no way CH gates actually that strongly regulating half of the transcriptome right even if it's bound there a third of the transcriptome so that said they are enriched for autism genes and cancer genes right pretty significantly and you know they are also I showed though they bound to pen scripts and start sites vast mobility so I suspect they're important and see if they is important but it means we don't understand why I feel like you know I feel like you put the painting wouldn't look except a small but clearly you know there's enough statistical enrichment that's unbiased okay let's thanks Mike thank you very much thank you thank you so much
