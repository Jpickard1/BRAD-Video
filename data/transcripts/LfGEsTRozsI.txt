I welcome everyone we're gonna go and get started for those of you who are new to this seminar series it's the tools and technology seminar series through the department of computational medicine and bioinformatics basically it's just a venue to discuss new tools technologies and/or methodologies that are either currently in development may be recently developed or just a neat tool or technology that researchers may find an interest so today and we have pizzelle and a couple other faculty and members here I guess we're also going to talk a little bit and they're gonna talk to us about linear programming tools for scheduling trainees and healthcare I do want to mention and there's a sign-in sheet that is going around please sign in and helps us with the pizza and with that thank you hi everyone my name is Billy Cosell I just graduated with my master's degree from college of engineering and industrial and operations engineering so for me linear programming is pretty familiar but I'm guessing for most of you it's not so we're gonna get into some scheduling issues I just wanted to recognize dr. Reddy dr. Siegel dr. gasket professor Gaskin lesser cone and then our other collaborators on this project are Janice Davis and AJ and some income Jiang I'm actually going to hand it over to dr. Etienne and dr. Siegel to talk about some of the background and motivation for the project first as a brief outline and then I'm gonna describe a little bit of what linear programming is so I'm going to try and fit one of our undergraduate courses into about five minutes and then we'll go into how we're applying that in a specific context for surgical block scheduling and how we're implementing that and then some conclusions are in the future so with that for people with things they already knew but I did want to go over a little bit about how medical training happens the story our training methodology right now is based on William Halsted twin 1890s start of the first surgical residency program which was the internship where he followed around the students until he thought they were ready and that had six years of residency followed by two years of being a house surgeon and then you were a doctor and it's not that different now after undergraduate program and medical school which if you hear people talking about m1 m2 v Rees that's the years of medical school you do an internship which is really a first year of residency and that postgraduate year one and a couple years residency range between three and seven and then a fellowship which is post residency training and so what we're talking about optimizing is the scheduling of educational activities between the internship through the fellowship years and since the time of Halsted there's developed a set of 24 medical specialty boards that certifications that you can have and at university Michigan we have 25 individual residency programs and 80 fellowships these can be sub specialties there's more residency than sit for whatever boards they want to more or less it's more complicated than that but so about over a thousand people are being trained to be doctors and the reason that scheduling is important is a number of them one of them is workflow you want to make sure that the right people get to the right places and then we have a good well staffed or well staffed well step units the residents and fellows serve as a component of the workforce that take care our patients and the reason scheduling is also important is that if you do it poorly if you get a resident a schedule that has back-to-back terrible months or experiences that they're not interested they can burn out and have a emotionally difficult time and non-optimal educational experiences and the third thing is patient care getting the right people to the right to the bedside in the right mix with good educational experiences improves patient care improves patient safety and patient satisfaction and as well as other things so who usually does the scheduling what were I'm talking about is in which witchdoctor ready we'll talk about scheduling a months of experiences it's usually can be one of the residents themselves the chief resident someone in charge of sort of directing their peers as well as faculty and staff the faculty is usually the program director and the staff is the administrators senior administrative staff and what do they have to do it's basically they sit down with at least right now usually they sit down with a big list of people and try to figure out who goes where when it's time intensive process we actually did a project where we looked at how this was done across a bunch of the different departments and some of them had got all the different departments who were involved in trading their residents together around a table and hashed it out in real time other people had a senior a senior administrator who had contact all that interested party and is this complicated negotiation would try to build a schedule that worked and it was in time intensive process what about 80 hours or so to build a schedule for one program we have 25 of these here there's a lot of stakeholders involved some people are sending us residents we're sending other people residents like st. Joe for different divisions departments this complex rules about who needs to be when how many of each type of person you get at different times and there are conflicting goals that residents want their vacation time when there are sisters getting married they want to have a week off or have a like schedule and vacation and staffing and things like that and there's lots of strategies that are used and because there are some of the constraints and such a complicated process we found basically that people adapted a good-enough strategy if you could get it done and it basically worked you were happy and we thought that that's a good place for optimizations programming to take it one step further and improve the product and make it easier so with that I'm going to carry over just a little bit talk about some of the specific programs to a doctorate hi my name is Rishi Reddy in one of the thoracic surgeons here at the University of Michigan how many people here have seen those TV show scrubs or ER Grey's Anatomy okay so the complexity in those shows is actually really underwhelming and I think a lot of those shows reflect what medicine was like maybe 30 40 50 years ago nowadays in terms of surgical schedule the surgical residency schedule even what we just put here is an example of the type of schedule that our general surgeon residents go through and so p gy 1 is first-year resident this is a fifth year resident it's a five year training program there are six residents a year and you can see the variety of different schedules or different rotations that everyone has to go on it's always interesting we watch the TV shows they're always in together in one big group it's actually not true you can see that there's a in this group alone we have I think at least 12 to 15 different schedules on there for plastic surgery they have a whole separate rotation some of these overlap with the previous general surgery schedule especially in the early years of the person second year but you can see over seven years but they have different senior rotations and the goal of these slides not to memorize is just to show you the complexity in terms of the problem and just to illustrate what we're going through so again each service requires a different resident complement some residents some services require one resident or to two residents others may require six some and it's also a different year some you may have one year of the general surgery residents I guess here on the white service you can have in the sick you multiple ones will go back so but it varies in terms of which way are you going to put everyone and it actually does become somewhat of a complex scheduling issue so again the traditional scheduling approach and I did this myself when I was a general surgery chief resident of barns and in st. Louis is your building rotation templates and then what you're doing is just alternating those templates and staggering them that's the simplest way to do it again you're adjusting for coverage educational needs or personal vacation needs is what Jake talked about so you may switch here and there but then again you're going to have people overlapping in ways that you weren't necessarily anticipating and then at the end of the year you're renegotiating you know who wants to skip their sister's wedding who wants to you know make changes with regards to that and so there's a lot of trading and none of it actually works out well and in the end I think as Jake mentioned that Goodenough mentality is actually what we've kind of drilled into the surgery residents because you're just happy so I think our goal here is to improve our methodology and improve our scheduling and so I'll ability from there all right so what is linear programming how can we actually use it in this context linear programming actually came out of like World War two military strategy planning and since then it's been applied to a lot of different areas primarily manufacturing and and those sorts of things it really hasn't been used in in health care at least not effectively until very recently but essentially what linear programming is is a way for you to model and solve really complicated story problems so if you remember back to late elementary school maybe middle school you'd be sitting in math class and your teacher would give you a paragraph long description of a problem that you have to pull out the relevant information for and essentially turn that into maybe an equation or two equations and then solve for for something in those equations that's basically what linear programming is except for instead of a paragraph we've got maybe a novels worth of words okay and so to figure everything out what you want to do is look at four key parts of any linear program so as an example this is a very very simple linear program so the first part are the sets of parameters so we don't have any sets here because it's so basic but sets are essentially a way for you to group or aggregate similar entities together so in the case of our program one of our sets is the residents then parameters are known inputs that known numerical inputs that relate to the decisions and the sets in some way so getting into the decisions here in this model we just have two basic variables X 1 and X 2 so we get to decide what those values are going to be but to decide what gonna be you need to have some some decision some influence affecting that decision and that is usually an objective function you want to have some objective function here it's to minimize a weighted sum of the two decision variables so X 1 plus 2 X 2 and if there were no restriction on that you could just say okay let's make X 1 and X 2 as small as possible right you can potentially make them negative infinity and then your objectives phenomenal but instead what we have is a set of constraints that limit our decision okay and so those are highlighted in green we have two constraints X xx plus x2 has to be greater than or equal to 5 so that's limiting how small you can make x1 and x2 and then the second constraint is that 2x1 + 3 x2 is less than or equal to 9 so that's not really going to affect too much here since we're saying basically the sum of these has to be smaller than some value and since we're minimizing it's not an issue and then finally you have your variable restrictions saying that these variables have to be non-negative so that's a very rough idea of linear programming a very basic example if we want to get into more complex issue like surgical block scheduling we're gonna have to define a lot more so first let's go through our sets like I said we're gonna have our sets of residents so for example a couple of the members of the set of residents would be myself doctor ready dr. Segal professor Cohn you know you're gonna have a nice long list of residents so in our problem we have about a hundred and five residents currently incorporated the second set which is really a nice feature of the model that that we developed is this set called resident categories which basically are ways to describe residents traits so for example we might say there is a trace of your discipline so are you a general surgery resident are you a plastic surgery resident vascular are you you know any number of disciplines we can incorporate we also have another type of category which is the level of the residents so going back to that that pyramid of training you have first-years p gy 1 PB y 2 py 3 going upward and that's essentially you know how long you've been out of school and how long you've been in in residency training that's some indication of your skill set just like the the discipline was an indication of your skill set we could also add in additional categories like does rock doctor ready like you right are you of male are you female all these sorts of things that we can categorize and group the residents by we have a third set which is our set of services that we're planning for and that we need to further and then the set of months is every month in the year so not parameters so our first parameter is actually a group of parameters AARC so there is a binary indicator for every single resident and a category pair indicating whether that resident fits into that category so do I fit into the category of University of Michigan graduate that's a yes so it's a one for me do I fit into the category of Ohio State fan that's a no so it's a zero okay is that clear how that works it's just this unknown input we can categorize in advance everyone's characteristics and then we have in this in this part of the model we have two groups of bonds so we have limits on the number of residents that can be on service on a given service in a given month that fit under a certain category so if I'm a first year resident then when I'm on when we're discussing the maid service for example they don't want in any given month more than two first-year residents because first year residents have pretty lacking skill sets they're not well trained at this point they can't do more we can't operate and so they're very limited in what they can do and so you want to put a limit abound on how many you have at any given time you could also say I want to four to five residents that are from the general surgery program at any given time so those are those are related to our service coverage requirements and then for our resident education requirements we have another set of bounds which are the number of months over the course of the year that a given resident needs to spend on a specific service so as a first-year resident I need to spend two months total on the may service two months total on blue service two months total on white service and so for some of these the bounds are actually different you might have two to three months on a given service that's the general gist are those all cleared everyone all right here's where we get into things that are not known in advance of the model these are decision variables so our decision is X RSM so for every resident service and month combination we decide are we assigning that resident to the service in the month so it's zero if not one if you are and you know how I introduce the whole we want an objective function to dictate how we decide these things at this point our model does not have an objective because it's still in development it's still being worked through but in the next couple of weeks we're going to be sitting down with the program directors to figure out what are the metrics that are going to guide a decision in assigning residents to services so here are three of the the basic constraints that are in this model in particular there are several more and I'll describe them briefly but for these I'm going to head and walk through the math to give you some idea of how we build these models in particular so the first one is that every resident gets assigned to one service every month we don't want to double assign you because you can't be in two places at once and we don't want to leave you off the list of residents that are working because then you're losing out on education so for example if we look at dr. Smith and the may service in July we can decide are you being assigned to that service in that month so it's pretty simple if yes it's a one if not it's a zero but we can also have the same or similar decision variables for the blue service the white service and any other service there is for now let's just assume that there's the three of them and we need to have exactly one service that were assigned in the month of July so does anyone know like didn't anyone suggest how we would actually put those decisions together to to form a constraint all the variables need to sum to one exactly that's exactly it so your decision for dr. Smith in in maize plus and blue plus and white that all adds up to one in the month of July but that's just for July right we need to be assigned every month so we're going to have a similar constraint that's for August and all the way through till June so for that single individual resident and single service there are actually 12 constraints that get built up and then we move on to the next and we have a similar set of 12 constraints so then now here's where we get into some math notation that I don't know if you guys are familiar with but essentially what this is is a summation over all services in our set of services of the decision variable X RSM must be equal to 1 and then that symbol is for all so it's for all residents and all months in our set of residents and months so if you had just two residents three services and two months or 12 months how many how many constraints are we building back total so 72 right so it'd be a pain to to write all those out right and and actually figure out okay this is where something goes but we can use this notation to actually encode this in a way that that's like a couple of lines of code to make for for as few as two residents and three services in 12 months 72 constraints so it's really nice our second set of constraints are the resident educational requirements so need yes of course oh so we're in that do you model the exception it's like not in May because of the sisters wedding yeah so I will I'll get to that essentially we have those this three sets set of constraints are not the entire thing we have other constraints that basically allow us to overwrite that so the second set of constraints are educational requirements that say I need over the course of the entire year two months on maize or whatever it is so again going back to dr. Smith we have a simple decision but now instead of summing over this going over the services in July we're gonna go over mais in all the months right so we have decision am I in August and so forth all the way through Chu so similar to before we're gonna have our expression and you sum up all the decisions and bound that so this is saying Proctor Smith needs one to two months over the course of the year on the May service and we'll create similar treatment or blue service white service any other service and the bounds those are our input parameters that we can change those who need safer for ever given resident every service and so here's our general formula for that is the sum over all months of our decision variable is between a lower and upper bound for every resident and every service finally we have the only service coverage requirements which tell us that for a given service we need between a lower and upper bound every month of residents that fit into a category so this is where that AARC matrix comes in so we just add in these parameters indicating whether resident fits a certain category so you can have general surgery you can have a first year you can say general surgery first year so you can combine categories so does anyone have an idea of how you put these how you incorporate the parameters into to make this decision essentially you're just going to multiply the decision by the parameter right so it'll look something like this so the parameter of whether dr. Smith is a general surgery resident iams the decision for you add all these up and so the general formula for that is a summation over the residence of the indicator times the decision has to be bounded so it's pretty straightforward it's pretty easy these are really simple constraints here's where we get back to your question of how do you how do you create the exception so you can have a distributed educational requirement so this is saying you can you can allow for a residence you have between 0 & 0 months on this service during this time window so it could be a single month it could be a group of months it could be every other month whatever you want but you can allow for ensuring that they're basically off off that service in a given month additionally you could say between these services you need some amount of time over the course of a set of months similar constraints for coverage needs so allowing for having a set of residence be across several services so the three main services for general surgery are maids blue and white so over the course of a single month we need five people from general surgery first years on those services you can say extended rotations are simply allowing for ensuring that residents assigned in the month of July to a certain service officer also are on service in the month of August so our chief residents in general surgery they do two month rotations so to ensure that we add in these extended rotations service sequencing allows you to say I need to go on to this service before I go out to that service service spacing allows you going back to the issue of burnout and working really hard services in a row for example if you're on trauma service like twice throughout the year you do not want them to be back to back because that's a really tough experience mentally and physically fatigued so we're going to split those and then resident pairing allows us to say if this resident is not on a particular service then we're actually going to bring in this resident as well that way we can pair maybe a junior with a more senior resident where you can pair potentially a resident that's not quite as strong with one that is stronger to ensure that we're still giving adequate patient care so how do we actually go about doing this well we spent several months myself and the undergraduate students meeting with Janice Davis who's the education director for general surgery and just put your brain learning about the rules what are the different things that we need to satisfy and then we built this model so throughout that time we developed it and built it and then started to actually encode this in C++ and we have as an academic institution we can get a license to a library called cplex which is a way for you to to model and then solve a linear program and so we encoded it and then started building out our input files to allow us to actually say here our set of residents here are the services here are the rules that we have and then in that process realized that maybe the model wasn't completely accurate and so we had to go back and and iterate on that but eventually we got to a point where we were able to test this model on last academic years data set and we're able to get a feasible solution in a matter of seconds it solves in like four seconds for perfusate okay so it's really fast really efficient and now we're at the point of collecting the information for this coming academic year from all the different program directors and we intend to present yeah are you solving of the easily so it's it's an integer it's binary all the decisions are binary so so okay so hallo what's the complexity if you add these binary the complexity may be do you wanna yeah I mean they're theoretically hard and one of the things I find frustrating about complexity is what C says things like there exists an instance for which this problem is solvable polynomial time what we have found in part because we're finding feasible solutions are not not imagine some objective function that these are solving pretty quickly but you could you could you could devise an instance that had structures such that integer program and so one of the challenges with all these problems is there are multiple ways that you can shape these constraints there are multiple ways you can describe the problem and what Billy's described in what's been a tremendous effort on the part of the students is working with the program director to fully capture conceptually what are the constraints there's a second layer which is how do I actually model those constraints in the tractable way and so in some cases your first shot goes and you can go and it solve some cases you can go and you go ahead and get a drink another drink and you wait and nothing happens and so the rules haven't changed but the way you have to formulate them starts to change so so far with this one we've been lucky check back in a year maybe Hobie still doesn't get your board relaxation full of energy to experiment what happens for the results yeah so if you think about it if your decision variables are 0 1 variables representing yes/no decisions let's take a step back if you are modeling a problem as an integer linear program to figure out manufacturing so if you're solving a problem where your model and saying that has integer quantity decision variables so I'm designing production line for Ford and my solutions and I relax the integrality and I get solutions like seven thousand four hundred ninety two point six cars in many cases the quality will be pretty good such that if you just round those decision variables you can still be feasible and you'll be still close to the optimal if your decision variables are yes/no and you get a point for what is that what does that mean and in a lot of cases you will get fractional values because what you get is multiple people who ideally would want to work the first weekend of the month and so the model for equity purposes you know if you have equity constraints that say everybody should have a relatively equivalent schedule then what we're gonna see is if I've got four people in only three weekends I give everybody one third or three-quarters so in general the upper relaxation is not going to get you very far so for this upcoming year so we're working with all the program directors ask for thoracic plastics I think there's seven seven programs total that that were actually scheduled here come's trained to include 80 hours a week so this is at a higher level of the monthly schedule we're not doing specific shift scheduling I'm gonna talk in a few minutes about some of the other projects very briefly about how we're doing some shift scheduling as well the individual services will dictate how many residents they need to accomplish the workload within the 80 hour week workweek constraints so and for those you don't know the eer workweek constraints basically for the residents and training or positions of training for the last 11 years now there have been rules that mandate you can't work more than 80 hours per week on average over any four-week period prior to that there were no limitations and so then that's really a monthly relative you know correct but it can actually go across any other month so it could be two weeks in the last two weeks of one rotation the first two weeks of the other so a chief resident level or you know a program director all the rotations have to fit within that you have to be compliant in that and so it doesn't affect this type of scheduling process that we have looked at that and other contacts so we'll have the information from all of the program directors in the next couple weeks and then we'll be building a initial schedule for their review on February 1st or right around there because I think February 1st is actually a weekend and so that's gonna be actually a tremendous improvement for them because last year they didn't get the schedule out until the end of April when they're having residents come in the interns come in for training in mid-may so they get very little notice of their schedules currently and so that's one of the things we're hoping for is to have everything finalized in the middle of February with a few months notice for everyone so we're just going to be updating those input files and then generating the reports for them to review so just to recap essentially what we found is that scheduling is actually really important for a number of reasons primarily because it affects the the patient care the training quality and how the workflow actually occurs throughout the hospital moreover surgical residency scheduling here at U of M is incredibly complex because of the inter woven programs and at to this point it's been pretty poorly executed at a universal level you know just in general presidency scheduling has not done well not only here at Michigan but but elsewhere as well however this model actually will address the scheduling needs in a pretty robust manner so for some of the future work we actually do need to spend some time over the couple the next couple of weeks to define our metrics and to build an objective function and so that's going to be a conversation that I have with all the program directors together to to get something that they can in consensus agree this is what we should be optimizing for we have a couple ideas for what we can do with that but I'm excited to hear what they're gonna have to say on that topic and then as I as I mentioned it's a pretty robust model and so one of the goals that we have moving forward is to actually apply this not just for the surgical residency program here at U of M but potentially the other residency programs at the university as well as at other institutions so to get to the topic of shift scheduling just a quick quick run-through of some of the other areas where we've been doing linear programming to solve for the schedules so for the pediatric medicine department or residency program last year for the first time students at CHEP's built the the rotation schedule this blocks schedule for their interns this year were actually expanding to all the residents in pediatric medicine and so that project is kind of working synchronously and together with with this project to make sure that everything is uniform and generalizable so that's been a pretty interesting project to work on which really it was borne out of the next one which is the shift schedule that we work on at CS Mott in the emergency department so each month we work with the chief resident to build their shift schedule so which resident is going to work each shift on every day of the month and so that meeting we're going to be building out marches scheduled tomorrow and that project is incredibly rewarding we get to go into the emergency department and and observe the the residents and I've actually been in there on the first day of the new academic year when someone is just coming on to to their residency program and I've gotten to ask them so how do you like your schedule what what do you think of of the schedule this month and this person having no idea that I was involved in building it was like oh it's awesome everyone told me residency sucks and this is actually a beautiful schedule so to have that interactions some of other students have worked on how to schedule patients for chemotherapy infusion at the Cancer Center we've got another project where we're scheduling physicians into the operating rooms and clinic times and then even at a higher level than specific physicians in the ORS and clinics you can do a master surgical schedule problem of how do we assign operating time to the various surgical departments finally there's nurse staffing staff scheduling problems so those last two have both been done in a variety of hospitals successfully and effectively so maybe in the future we'll be will be doing some of that as well but I just wanted to give an overview of all the different areas where where you can apply this and so there's a lot of opportunity to apply some industrial engineering and optimization techniques to improve scheduling so with that I just want to acknowledge chef's Department of Surgery southbounder Foundation and the doctors company foundation for helping support these projects and I'll open it up to any further questions and comments I'm from the Medical School and one of the things we struggle is clerkship scheduling for years three and four and threes and fours in your pyramid and it's changing dramatically with the new curriculum and curriculum redesign have you put any thought or considered extending to that would you consider we would we would consider I don't think we haven't talked about it too much at least not with faculty so the traditional mental model is in the first years of classroom instruction in the last two years of apprenticeship Bakehouse and learn what the residents go through and there's a shift towards making those first three years in two years and then allowing for more flexibility for medical students to explore other learning opportunities during the second two years so we have talked about that I think that there's I think a lot of what has been done here and you put the bulbs of that the hard part is that there is a this morning at 11:30 coming from a medium there's really no merchant models gonna be you want that the schedule is gonna be right now for the second-year med students the new curriculum yeah as I say we're having to work on scheduling the first the new incoming m1 students which is the challenge is adding now clerkship experiences to their first year which has not been done in the past so that's and then you the some of the variables in this aren't the variable locations there's revenue risk because they need to be there on time and if they're not the physicians don't spend as much time and so there's a lot of variables in there which I'm sure you face the same things it's not just about training engineering students like billiards training clinical students so part of the discussion has been there's a push towards things like systems thinking and process improvement within the curriculum and how does that fit into some of these so we don't have med students working with us and we've had students come to approaches about how can I get some experience working on some of these problems from thanks so we have an exactly matched minimum set of residents or we have a few extras that have to be accommodated into the scheduling which are elasticity for someone being you know it's yeah so not only illness things like maternity leave we have you know we have residents that we are scheduling for that are actually out for part of the year and because you know they're giving birth and and need that time with the child and so we can actually create specific rules for them that are unique from everyone else in in their category really like we have a chiefin in vascular surgery that were specifically planning for they need certain services in the month of July and August because those are that's the time leading up to the birth and so we can handle all those things as far as elasticity of the numbers of residents there's some tightness for a few of the services we're going to have a lot of learners [Music] certain services in the month of August but it's something that we just relaxed the bounds a little bit to ensure that they're gonna know that there's nothing we can do about in like spreading this over the year because there are contractual agreements with other institutions that we need to send residents at certain times and so that's one of the issues where it's basically forced a lot of people into certain rotations and you bring up the play which is a big important one of uncertainty and so there's an added layer of you know we've talked about going from linear programs to integer programs of integer programs I think that is fantastic that your programs in some form I was involved in project seven years ago with Jones Hospital Michigan and this notion of what do you do when a resident you were planning on doesn't arrive and this was early 2000s they have a fairly large number of medical students coming up residency and they were running into people's visa issues so you're supposed to be on service in July and your visa hasn't come through and we actually went back and rebuilt the schedule to say if you have of these you know if you're coming in on a certain type of of these the first three months we are putting you on electives services where if you don't have somebody it's medicine we have a big problem if you're doing erupted in elective rotation in sports medicine and you don't show up things things don't have quite the same effect so being able to figure out where can we build robustness into the schedule to say the places of things are most likely to go wrong we put the padding in there but there's not a lot of wiggle room in terms you can't just say well let's get three extra presidents would you say surgery residents don't get sick they do get pregnant now they didn't spend here 20 years ago but now we make accommodations or it's an accommodation that's not the right word but now you have to fill that into the schedule because otherwise you know you can accommodate 30% of general surgery residents are now women for the last 10 years but we're 20 years ago is probably 5% so 5% cardiothoracic surgeon practice or women 15 percent of 22 are from so how do you make those changes to the schedule so it's surgery is easier because in terms of the day-to-day illness it really is probably less than a handful of times out of 105 surgical residents that anyone misses a day of work for illness unless you have a major illness that's partly the culture and that's part of a modest above what it attracts but until then for some of those bigger things um so I'm approaching this from like basically a computer science student that's completely naive in medical school and I just like assume this is how all scheduling would be done like this is the 21st century this is how it should be done is this like the case in other places or are you building on models though that people are doing are you pioneering this and I'm just completely out of it I just don't know what I drove hi in here there has been so some of other applications there has been work but we really haven't seen any literature on them using linear programming to do scheduling for residents I've been in a number of different training programs and when I was a chief resident watch you just ago I did it by hand whether they big Excel spreadsheet that was how Janice Davis is doing it as of the year and a half ago by yourself is the kind of education so on so partly through our operation is thought this would be something that would be abused but I think a vast majority of programs in medicine and healthcare are doing it by a tiny bit of healthcare in general is advanced in a lot of ways in terms of the biomedical technology but in a lot of the operational aspects some things that we like it like in Walmart you know where your $2.49 rolled paper towels is anywhere in this nationwide system but in a hospital you can not know where a two million dollar piece of equipment is because if someone took it from one room to the other you can't find it because the hospital is a big place and you don't know where the CRA you don't like it's literally you don't know where things are like million dollars of equipment so should have RFID there so so like Mayo Clinic is having RVD so that's something that some of the pioneers are doing but it's certainly not widespread and it certainly it's also indicative of a general issue which is that there are a lot of technological advancements that are taking for granted in industry and a very forward-thinking thing in medicine so so that sort of a global theme about how technology is being applied to medicine it's very uneven there are state of the art things in very low tech industries that are not being used in medicine puts us back into the middle so another example that is you can log on today and find out where your amazon shipment is but you can log on and find out the status of your blood tests that you had done on Monday unless it's already been reported you can't find out you know whether it's been reported to the doctor yet where the doctor is read it whether the you know did you consider other approaches beyond the near programming so we find on engineering so we talked a little bit about doing some other approaches but so what were the main advantages of this one this I think for us it's it's something that we know pretty well part of the thing is that a lot of this work is done with undergraduate students and so linear programming is a course that is taught by Professor Cohn in our department initially I actually don't others other than drawing things are going oh darn it erase I'm sort of curious your your so much doesn't mean there aren't other things it's just I look at this and I say well of course this is a linear programming problem so what do you all look at this and say this is what would you do well that was the question what are their approaches what else mark I don't know this to me and I think to begin to get a peaceful solution you probably would want to use something like linear programming but then if you want to take into account some of the uncertainties you know I want to start simulating that and saying okay well you know suppose you know Amy is sick on Wednesday what is that what happens in or suppose Amy decides she doesn't want to be a doctor anymore she drops out of the program four months into this and you know or you know her husband you know decides he's gonna take a job in Los Angeles and suddenly she's transferred to UCLA's Hospital you didn't know about that there's not happening these things all happened so you could build that into a simulation and you can start to begin to address how robust the solution is with respect to certain types of uncertainty and then eventually I suspect you move through the direction that you were talking about which is moving from linearity imager the stochastic optimization so that's right I think you actually gave a hint of this which is that you have some ones in the rotations that are soft so they elect them so if you need to cover your script people from those land those sirens to cover there is a flow of rotation for different levels of rotation so for one month you're on float which means you could be pulled into any different rotation for a week at a time or sometimes use a day at a time that actually goes against the educational curriculum and so but having said that that's the back up system especially in the context of the 80 hour work week so there is some redundancy built in to accommodate mostly for our scheduled vacations or residents are going to meet Instagram or something like that what things we know ahead of time you have that float resident or the one or two flow residents that can accommodate come other your models take into account something as subjective as quality of care because you have two patients they were treated the same and one person's gonna say this is the worst place in the world one person's gonna say this is the greatest place in the world I don't think this takes into account sir so this won't currently take into account ideas that you know if you're gonna ensure if you can ensure that the residents don't have a brutal schedule that's just draining on them then they're gonna be more aware they're gonna be friendlier to their their patients and so perception of pull through from that the patient side is so subjective it's it's hard because there's it's so multi factorial terms of what's the positive versus negative experience and some of that's just set by the attending physician before they even enter the door you know in terms of how you set the stage and things like things of you can do a perfect job and then we I heard in one of the departments the fact that they had to wait an extra half-hour an hour to get the discharge notes from the physical therapist and pharmacists that's what impact there's their patient satisfaction score the most and the other thing is you can have these constraints where you said you ideally want to have two seniors do juries on the service at all times and that will ensure that there's nothing for peace things going smoothly and it's not a hard constraint necessarily so when you fail to reach that but then the patient might say I couldn't possibly fail which doctor is my doctor that's well for different people any other questions thank you
