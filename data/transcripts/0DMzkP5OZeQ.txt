good afternoon everyone and thank you for being here and listening to my um talk and um learning about my research um i'm just gonna start sharing uh while i figured this out um i'm i'm a postdoc i'm a fifth year postdoc in dr deepak nagrath's lab um in the biomedical engineering department um i received my phd from rice university in 2016 and i moved with dr undergrad here in the beginning of 2017 um and most of my work my research has been focused on um developing and optimizing both empirical and computational tools to help us understand cancer metabolism and trying to discover therapeutic targets particularly metabolic targets for cancers a lot of our work has really been focused on looking at cancer or solid tumors as complex ecosystems ecosystems that do not um just have cancer cells that exist in a vacuum but components that continually interact with each other um a lot of these interactions are critical um for the progression of cancers of for progression of tumors and really we're trying to build tools analytical tools that can help us quantitate and understand these interactions um so that we can utilize them for therapeutic benefit for the audience that is not very familiar with cancer um i'll start off with a very simplistic explanation of it um so healthy cells can acquire genetic mutations that can lead to downstream interactions in biological networks um that lead to um emergence of phenotypic traits in healthy cells uh that lead to their transformation into cancerous cells and these phenotypic traits are commonly known as a hallmarks of cancer some of them you may know of um cancer cells have the ability to replicate um uncontrollably uh and in an unlimited fashion um they're able to resist programmed cell death and they have this ability to invade the lymphatic and the vascular system to metastasize to other organs um for us as a lab we understand cellular metabolism and we think that it lies at the heart of all of these different transformations um these genetic mutations and altered biological interactions in cancer cells and also environmental factors dysregulate cancer metabolism um and in essence facilitate a lot of these uh hallmarks of cancer so the metabolism of the cell is basically its engine it it um it utilizes food and nutrients breaks it down so that the cell can produce energy uh produce simpler molecules uh for performing different biological function and whatever it doesn't use is um uh expanded as heat or waste and the cellular metabolism is a very tightly regulated process uh and also complex uh as of now we've documented over 13 000 reactions that happen across 4000 metabolites and the metabolic network looks something like this so a lot of the work on cancer metabolism has really focused on a very small portion of this the central carbon metabolism which is responsible for the energy metabolism of cells and a very good example of metabolic dysfunction in cancer cells has been the wahberg effect which was characterized about 100 years ago where dr wahberg observed that cancer cells even in the presence of oxygen tend to utilize glucose can convert most of it into lactate and produce atp um in a very inefficient fashion um whereas healthy cells were typically in the presence of oxygen utilize glucose and produce atp through oxidative phosphorylation which is a very efficient uh process and it's metabolic traits like these that distinguish cancer cells from healthy cells um that can really help us understand um very critical differences in cancer cells and we can use them to our advantage to find targets that can selectively uh kill off cancer cells and um not affect healthy cells as much and a lot of our motivation has been um the fact or rather the question that uh how can we quantitatively study cancer metabolism to really uh effectively um understand these metabolic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells and we have a lot of tools at our disposal we have metabolomics techniques that help us measure metabolite abundances within within these cells uh we can also measure what's happening outside these cells where we can effectively measure the consumption and secretion of metabolites by cancer cells and we have the ability to consolidate all of this data use high dimensional data analysis techniques that we have at our disposal to sort of put together a metabolic picture that represents um metabolic rates of cancers but really the one of the most important tools that we have at our disposal um is metabolic flux analysis where we can essentially uh measure um the intracellular metabolic activity of cells um and and metabolic the metabolic physiology of these cells are actually directly represented by um metabolic uh fluxes or the rate of conversion of these nutrients and metabolites um through um through the cells essentially and and these fluxes are a direct representation of cellular physiology and their metabolism and it's very akin to looking at the flow of traffic rather than individual vehicles on the road um where we can understand that some roadways are more important than the others um in the same way we know that some metabolic pathways and cancers are more important than other metabolic pathways which can then later be targeted for therapeutic benefit and um understanding or actually quantifying these intracellular fluxes can help us understand cancer metabolism unfortunately most of these intracellular fluxes are not directly measurable with empirical techniques so we rely on mathematical tools particularly first principle models like mass balance where we can translate the metabolic network of a cell into mathematical uh equations use the pseudosteady state assumption um to describe what's happening inside the cells as long as we can measure what's happening outside the cell but these flux analysis techniques this metabolic flux analysis technique essentially is useful for simpler toy models simpler mathematical models where we're limited um with the predictive ability of these models to the number of measurements we can really make outside the cell but we have at our disposal other empirical tools as well particularly our ability to use stable isotope nutrients uh which can help us track uh metabolism inside the cell as well um generally what what we do in these stable isotope tracer experiments is that we replace uh commonly found nutrients in cell culture media with nutrients that are labeled with heavier isotopes in this example i've shown 13 carbon glucose where all six carbons in the glucose molecules are replaced with um a stabilizer of 13 carbon which weighs which has a um which is one atomic atomic mass unit heavier than naturally abundant 12 carbon in glucose and we as we replace um these nutrients in the culture media with the heavier isotopes we can essentially trace the flow of glucose one of the major nutrients uh for cells um downstream into their downstream metabolites what essentially have ends up happening is that it's like adding a tracer um to a complex uh network of pipes connected with each other with different flow rates and the tracer would essentially leave behind a footprint depending on the flow rates of these pipes and the distribution pattern of these heavier isotopes and downstream metabolites can be measured with instruments like mass spectrometers but this unique footprint that these tracers leave behind really rely on two things one is the tracer that we use in these experiments and the intracellular fluxes um that can that essentially define cellular metabolism and we also have the ability to really mathematically represent the flow of these tracers within cellular metabolism since we know a lot of these atomic transf transitions that happen within metabolic reactions and we can represent all of those mathematically um in addition to that simple metabolic flux analysis system of equations i showed earlier we can add on this complexity that we have with the stable isotope racing experiments and create more complex models that can help us improve the predictability predictive capability of um and reliability of these uh metabolic models in essence so on one hand we can make these empirical measurements um extracellular fluxes or metabolic consumption and secretion that happens outside the cell we can measure the footprint that's left behind with the stable isotope tracers inside the cell and we can put all of this data into our metabolic model that is defined by these systems of equations and come up with a prediction of intracellular fluxes in the cell and um to begin with we use this tool to understand the metabolism of tuber stroma stoma which is basically components of solid tumors that are non-malignant and the tumor micro environment as we understand it is a complex ecosystem with different types of cells mostly uh fibroblasts adipocytes um along with the malignant cells that exist in their um and immune cells that also exist with that smattering of blood vessels that exist in solid tumors and metabolic alterations in cancer cells are not cell autonomous they really are defined by the biological um alterations within the cancer cells but also the tumor micro environment which is formed of all of these non-malignant cells and we now know that the cell the non-malignant cells in the tumor micro environment really can support the metabolic um the metabolic demand and the bionic energetic demand of cancer cells to help tuber progression and survival and um over the past few decades um research has shown that cancer cells really can adapt to um their tumor micro environment and come up with ways to alter their own metabolism uh to be able to utilize mutants they rely on um and sort of um and also survive in the very harsh micro environment that they really uh thrive in and uh an important part of these metabolic adaptations has been interactions direct interactions with other um non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment so for us the question changed a little bit it became how can we quantitatively study tumor metabolism and use that to guide the treatment of cancer and um one of the first components of one of the first mechanisms we looked at was direct metabol metabolic exchange between stromal cells or non-malignant cells and cancer cells and um we had we had done an extensive amount of experiments on ovarian cancer cells um and we understood that um cancer-associated fibroblasts um were an important component of ovarian cancer tumors ovarian tumors um they're typically the most abundant non-malignant cells in these uh ovarian tumors um and they these these calves are essentially transformed from normal ovarian fibroblast during tumor genesis um what we knew before this was that some type some ovarian cancer cells rely heavily on this nutrient um on this amino acid glutamine for proliferation and survival they can essentially not survive without glutamine in the culture media however when we co-culture these cancer cells these glutamine-dependent cancer cells with calves are derived from ovarian tumors they essentially stopped caring about glutamine present in the media however this effect was not observable when we co-cultured them with normal ovarian fibroblasts so there was something special about these gaps that essentially helped them support the glutamine requirement of these cancer cells and bioinformatics analysis helped us understand that or at least indicated to us that um these calves particularly had the ability to anabolize or synthesize glutamine um in some way in some fashion and that was probably responsible for supporting the glutamine requirement of these ovarian cancer cells uh a few other interesting um observations we made was that normal ovarian fibroblasts themselves were very reliant on glutamine for their growth for their survival um and viability um and calves were essentially um they were agnostic to the presence of glutamine in the culture medium um but more interestingly cats were able to secrete glutamine in culture media deprived of glutamine so there was definitely something going on there was an altered metabolic pattern in these gaps that allowed them to synthesize glutamine from the nutrients that were available to them and what we did was we utilized our 13 carbon metabolic flux analysis technique to understand what was happening in normal ovarian fibroblasts as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts to really understand how they differed um from normal fibroblasts and but able to produce beautifully so in normal fibroblasts what we realized was that if we deprived them of glutamine they were unable to support a critical component of their central carbon metabolism which was the grab cycle or the dca cycle which is coupled to their oxidative phosphorylation um they were in the absence of glutamine they were unable to really adapt to um that absence of glutamine through alternative ways and essentially had very poor viability however calves on the other hand were really um prolific in adapting to that glutamine absence and they were able to utilize glucose to compensate for whatever lack of glutamine they had in the culture media to drive that tca cycle requirement that they have but they were also able to use aspartate and asparagine as sources for carbon and nitrogen um to synthesize glutamine that they were then secreting which were essentially being used up by these cancer cells so this way we were able to use this technique to understand what was happening outside the cancer cells in the tumor stoma particularly these cancer-associated fibroblasts and how they were supporting the metabolic needs of these ovarian cancer cells um another metabolic interaction type of metabolic interaction that we looked at was through these extracellular vesicles that are secreted essentially by all types of cells but particularly in the in these solid tumors that we were looking at uh we found that these exosomes which are a particular class of extracellular vesicles secreted by cells um in this case exosomes secreted by stromal cells non-malignant cells uh they were able to support um cancer cells that existed in a metabolically deprived culture medium and uh what we realized was that these cats were able to package um we essentially discovered this in the lab that casts these cancer-associated fibroblasts and prostate and pancreatic cancer cells were able to package three metabolites into these exosomes which they were then secreting and those exosomes were being taken up by these cancer cells to um essentially compensate or rather adapt to the metabolically deprived culture medium there was they were in and this sort of physiologically represented um a solid tumor where they do exist in a nutrient-deprived environment uh in vitro we were able to see this happen at a uh at a functional level where um without certain essential amino acids like glutamine and phenylalanine um pancreatic cancer cells had poor viability but the moment you um supplemented their culture media with exosomes derived from these tremble cells they were essentially able to regain that functionality uh that viability that they lost in the nutrient deprived media so at this point we knew that exosomes were able to at least compensate for that uh deprivation of some certain essential amino acids we just didn't know how they were doing it and how by how much they were able to do it so we designed this experimental um system where we were able to trace metabolites that were being packaged by stomal cells or calves um in these exosomes we characterized the secreted exosomes themselves and um we fed those labeled exosomes to these cancer cells to see how the metabolites within these exosomes were being used up by the cancer cells to support their metabolic needs and then along with this experimental design we essentially um developed this metabolic flux analysis technique called exosome mediated metabolic flex analysis which could help us quantitate that packaging that happens at the forefront of this system um of metabolites being packaged into exosomes um those exosomes being um internalized by cancer cells and then using them for their own metabolic function so on the left hand side of this equation were the cancer-associated fibroblasts where they were using whatever nutrients were available to them to support their own metabolism but also um dynamically packaging those metabolites into exosomes and with this exo mfa we were able to quantify how much of the metabolites from um the calf's own metabolism were being packaged into these exosomes and then on the other hand we were able to sorry um we were able to feed those exosomes and then quantitate how much of those metabolites were being used up by the cancer cells and we had to do this um dynamically so since we had only a limited number of exosomes to feed to these cancer cells and they were really reliant on these exosomes for their viability we looked at how the cancer cell metabolism um changed when they were exposed to these exosomes so in the first three hours um cancer cells were pretty viable um they were using about 30 they were supporting um 30 of their um tca cycle fluxes with the metabolites that they received from these exosomes however as time went on and the exosomes present in the media were being continually continuously internalized by these cancer cells um that support the metabolic support for their tca cycle they were receiving from their exosomes uh decreased slightly and then by 12 hours that had significantly reduced uh quite a lot what we'd also seen experimentally later on that if we were able to replenish um the culture media with more exosomes this cycle reset itself um and then the cancer cells were able to use up meta metabolites from these exosomes um again and um the experimental design um since it was a batch process it couldn't it really doesn't capture what's happening physiologically in these tumors um but at least we were able to see what was um happening in um or we were able to find a good enough representation to see what would happen in tumors in reality where these exosomes were really supporting these nutrient-deprived cancer cells uh one important um byproduct of this algorithm was really um being able to predict the rate of internalization of exosomes by cancer cells which was proving really difficult um doing experimentally there weren't a lot of good techniques available to quantitate the rate at which cancer cells are able to um internalize these exosomes and use the metabolites they have within them but with the exo mfa algorithm we were even able to do that so apart from the metabolic um interaction with the metabolic support gas providing to these cancer cells we were also able to answer this one biological question about the mechanism of uptake of exosomes by cancer cells with this algorithm um yeah so this sort of summarizes what we were able to do we were able to quantify what was happening in the donor cells which were the gaps which were packaging metabolites we were able to quantitatively prove that the metabolites packaged within these exosomes was supporting um the energy metabolism of cancer cells and essentially what we had designed was a 13-carbon metabolic flux analysis algorithm that connected a multi-cellular system um which was one of the i think the first ones that were available at the time and another advantage that i haven't listed here is that um this algorithm can easily be adapted to any other system where there is a transport of free metabolites through any type of extracellular vesicles from a donor cell to a recipient cell
