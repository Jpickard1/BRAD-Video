mention there's a sign-in sheets if you've not signed in please do so that it helps us justify kids on the food so I'd really appreciate it if you could sign it and today resources yep thanks everybody for coming yeah as Marcy in thanks MARSOC unit production this is a project that I started on my vacation and interviewed monster medical school of my little brother and so this is actually the first time he presented to people and I'm very excited about this web tool and I think that it has a lot of potential to change the way we as researchers reference information when I'd like from you guys's and as people I've seen this presentation is to hopefully take home some points for yourself maybe to be able to use the resource moving forward to further your own research as well as [Music] resources named pub mal and the name stock is a modeling biological pathways by redefining referencing and we'll be elaborating on how this web tool actually performs this function so it's really those tools really born out of my MD my PhD years wishing that I had a tool like this so I saw several problems within research that were occurring broadly it was a failure and I'll go into each of these when were in depth there's a failure of communication among researchers as we used different jargon to describe our work a failure of narrative and what I mean by narrative is packaging many experiments together confited consistent story and also a failure of recall by each individual researcher to remember exactly which experiments were performed that to find the foundations of a particular field so with respect to communication as I said different researchers use different terms to describe the same phenomena potato patato solanum tuberosum tomato tomahto solanum lycopersicum these are all the same thing but different people may say or these things differently and they all but however they all refer to the same and how can we precisely describe what's happening when we run clear about who the participants are so part of this tool is addressing this problem a failure of narrative as I mentioned narrative being many experiments put together and what's true about most narrative that men or stories you've heard outside of science well one thing that is true about is that stories are often untrue and there we've had a lot of problems with the reproducibility within science in 2011 fair found inconsistencies reported that they found inconsistencies in two-thirds of the work that they tried to replicate in March 2012 Amgen found only 11 percent reproducibility of experiments that they were using to help further their work in pharmaceutical field and retractions have grown tenfold by the last decade but are still only count only 0.2% of papers are retracted therefore you have a very large discrepancy between the reproducibility across labs and the trade of retraction and an example of a narrative that has been plagued with with problems was the 1998 Lancet study the proposal link between bowel disease autism into the MMR vaccine and it took a very long time however in 2010 The Lancet formally retracted this paper only after many many papers were published to the contrary so reasons for this failure of narrative wealth in with respect to Lancet case fraud is suspected then there's also misinterpretation of of results as well as for statistical methods failures in peer review and also the pressure to publish or perish or too many narratives being put out to rapidly meaning - I'm using this term in a somewhat pejorative apophysis driven science the idea that you as a researcher you have an idea and then making the data together so another problem we encounter is a failure of recall just thinking mode trying to remember exactly where in the literature we encountered these experiments and some people are more prone to this than others I have a series of brain scans here very activity here's a took a scan of doctor cone a mild cognitive impairment and then there was so when I got myself scanned I showed some pretty significant deficits ventricular enlargement so some people are more prone to this problem than others so to summarize the problems that a mouth was set out to address failure of communication among researchers failure of narrative the idea of many experiments being packaged together and the failure of recall by each individual researcher and I set up what allegories could I establish that really encaptured encapsulated this problem or defined this problem and there are several ones that failed pretty miserably we had teos with respect failure of communication the menus in a foreign language failure of narrative or product but they have this tasteless fibrous meat matrix which is not chicken and and failure of recall I've never had a memorable meal there some of you would say can we get the lights down actually variance for those of you who watch television through the 1990s I don't know how many of that to you here actually art we have Twin Peaks I didn't I didn't understand it in the moment here's log lady down there it had the worst conclusion possible and I had no memory of how we got there and finally brother for a 90s music box there's a song informer by snow it was kind of catchy but what he was he saying he's saying a leaky Boom Boom down I didn't know what that meant exactly and it turns out it's a song about him being worried about snitches I didn't know the narrative didn't make sense with this it looks like an accountant pretty much being worried about being on the wrong side of the law and very few remember that so none of these analogies perfectly fit but I did settle on transformers actually I love transformers when I was it have many facets and components and when you put them together in different ways they could assume different functionalities you see here we have the semi here we have a a launching combat pad of sorts and then whose Brian is all glory so I thought of this very similar to an experiment an experiment has different components different facets and when you alter them precisely you come out with different functional states that you can observe much like the transformer however bring a group a bunch of these experiments together they try and construct a narrative around those sometimes it can have disaster and for those of you who aren't familiar with the Transformers movie series I'm going to say just don't waste your time oh and here's Michael Bay the person who who drives a project says Mike I am Michael Bay destroyer of childhood I just found it randomly how does this allegory carry through failure of communication Energon Allspark microcycle matrix of leadership what are these things failure of narrative superficial characters superficial themes and consistencies plot holes Wall Street Journal described it as a pile of glittering jungle and failure of recall I have no idea what happened during these movies but despite seeing all of them do was this a matter of amnesia did I actively suppress them or do my subconscious repress them because the plot lines were just that stupid so how does pub mouth address these different problems with respect to communication as we described it researchers use different terms to describe the same phenomenon and it introduces an idea that many of you are familiar with ontology a shared vocabulary to characterize the types properties and interrelationships of concepts sorry and so to get us to all speak the same language we need to draw from the same dictionary and to do this I thought I relied on the NCBI the National Center group of bioinformatics for my vocabulary and we have many different categories of categories of biological entities that we examine in biology and there are corresponding NCBI databases to them the gene database for transcripts we use the nucleotide database filtered for mRNA for proteins as a protein database whose mama fuels their the pubchem database is meant for processes and diseases there's the medical subject headings database and the last database that actually serves as an a further degree of ontology is a the homology database which is actually describe each gene transcript and protein across all eukaryotic species with a single term for each for each type all based on homology so if to find these within a regular PubMed browser you would just click on PubMed up here and you see them highlighted down here is one of the many NCBI databases and gene nucleotide protein pubchem the medical subject headings and homology are all found there and so we rely on this these databases to derive our terms and we're going to be going through and doing an example in which we can see that's in action as well with respect to a failure of narrative what PubMed gravitates towards and proposes is a system by which individuals are allowed to publish and reference individual experiments as opposed to whole works this allows individuals to characterize where previously done found usually within a single figure and a single letter within that figure as well as publish experiments that counter previously published work without having to commit to an entire counter narrative it's it's very difficult for people to get funded to publish a work that is this described as negative or contrary and frequently it also serves as a annals of null results or for an individual researcher could be a lab notebook as far as failure of recall this one's a little bit simpler we currently cite things in a bibliography as you see kind of down below and pub now promotes publishing individual experiment like I described previously and you have to designate the journal thing there a figure number and letter and it's stored and easily retrieved so this is what a paper I published in each one last December looks like a blender by our system I figured I'd start with kind of an end product you have a biological pathway in which many of these different biological entities are are interacting and a directionality to it in which you have arrows suggesting some increasing either activity or or transcription and red teas indicating inhibition and so you can see that there are many experiments here and within this paper that related these different entities and some between two entities there were many experiments that describe that relationship as well so how do we get there we get there by describing individual relationships one by one essentially and what you can see is we start out with a cause which is normally the independent variable an action increases/decreases it doesn't change and then an effect which is also which it would be the dependent variable and then specify precisely where where it's found so to do an example of this I relied on a pathway that a lot of people have encountered previous they had allergic signaling so here you can see epinephrine signals through beta adrenergic receptor to stimulate these G proteins we've got a hetero trimeric g-protein G alpha dissociates from beta and gamma goes to on to stimulate adenylate cyclase which produces cyclic AMP II which then goes on to stimulate protein kinase a so the very first component of that would be epinephrine leading to stimulation of Drano receptor a beta one so here you can see a very simple experiments you have increases in epinephrine from 0 to 10 lead to increases and Adreno receptor beta one activity and it's a statistically significant change so how do we encode this well we change our independent variable or cause it would be small molecule well put an epinephrine then click on our action say that it increases based on the fact that this is a statistically significant increase and then sorry and then indicate that our dependent variable the adrenaline adrenaline third beta one is increased and specify where in a particular paper that is found for simplicity sake I'm just going to use this figure oh okay one thing that you can also do is in addition to citing it from if this were coming from a paper you can also choose that file and upload it yourself so that individual experiments you do upload it so with respect to this system I was hoping to then go through quickly and show how this would actually be done so we here at at PubMed org I'm in the add relationship we said small molecule epinephrine and then it sends over a query to the public to pub Hammond and asks for a list back of things that fit epinephrine and then the NCBI hopefully this research that will pop up pretty quickly come on we'll fill this in well well that's a getting piped through the prop the reason the the small molecule takes longer than others is because it actually goes through two different search engines first it goes through pubchem substance it goes up chem compound so yeah there we go so I spelled it wrong the first time sorry about that and since we we're making a we have our table number and tape and figure letter then when we save this we're able to see that a connection is made between epinephrine and the adrenergic receptors and a summary down at the bottom describes small molecule epinephrine increases the a donor Adreno receptor beta one based on this PubMed ID this figure and this is you other individuals can come in and edit this if they'd like so that it is an interactive database so take one of those and then we'll just take the next step which was the Adreno receptor and that connected to the G alpha which is known as CNAs and if we were to assume it was the next figure and in the in a paper the figure 1b perhaps and when you save it then you can see that a system is a marching in which you have epinephrine leading to a terrific receptor leading to GN G alpha s and increases the good word for them so that's that's a new cosa activates yeah so activates would be more precise in this particular you since I agree and I think that there's a lot of room for post post translational modifications or precision in language and we're trying to make the most Rod broadly applicable for this for biological biological processes activates could be met however um creating to increase phosphorylation it could increase yeah that's one of many dipstick Euler because some things increase the quantity haha and other things increase activity reasons sure sure now it's it's it's a it's a very good point and there's room in the description to to further elaborate on the type of relationship between two entities that you're observing but the terms that we settled on were just as broad as possible so another question would be are seems like the way you input information into your system is like relationship centric and Medicare starting if you publish a paper your figure your single figure might tell a multiple relationship and in this way you might need to do multiple uploads or multiple reference for single figure but tells multiple things at the same time probably that would be a little laborious right yeah it certainly it certainly is and in the paper that I took four years of my my work to generate but it took about two hours to upload around 70 relationships okay and so you know yes I think there is a little bit of work and to be done and in the future we'd like natural language processing or something along those lines to be able to go in to individual figures individual parts of individual figures protect perhaps even interpret the graph and automatically upload these relationships but I think we're not at that point just yet and so for the time yes it is a little bit laborious to upload every relationship within a within an individual paper but that's all so hopefully we're crowdsourcing will come into play a batch upload you know for a given set of fields it seems like a pretty good idea for situations so scat scaffolding that's out mean my little brother have been discussing it there are a bunch of pathways including the cake pathways let's see wiki pathways that the reactants that have several of well categorized versions of these pathways and some hoping in the future to scaffold the site such that you can see pathways that have been established before and hopefully are well feted and then have people go in and put in the precise points in the research in the literature that those relationships oh I'm saying if you have a single paper cotton you have ten videos and each figure there's five different relationships aha for those fifty yeah different relationships hi nice upload an excel file with the set of predefined column so then you know yeah you you you could I think what you would miss out on would be the ability to search through the NCBI so the relationships there would be the relationships that you had predefined and you can you can enter free you can freeform enter terms what this relying on the NCBI databases allows you to do is is narrow your focus to yes this is the term that I wanted to use and so I think yes you certainly could and then how it links to other people's research might be hindered because you're not using the same vocabulary as other individuals but you probably get around that have a have like an input wizard where if you put in a 50 relationships in an Excel that it says or these the terms just automatically doesn't search us for each field shirk' gives you through and to validate it yeah so you wouldn't be able to upload it directly as the excel but you still have to go through and say since the term is this the term business the term and yeah you we certainly could make a tool like that the program of communication so I think that you know you just created yet another network you know what you've entered is subject to interpretation as much as any other scientific result I just don't see I think you know boy I cannot give that compound haha I mean so I think it's perfect you have looked like with respect to compounds yeah you have we link everything back to PC compound which is a supposedly one of the better annotated ways of describing any different any molecule PC pubchem substance is a little bit more broad many things potato potahto can be both exist within pubchem substance but oh they were only be represented by one molecule with a public compound and so that's the hope is is to get to at least when when one person says potato to at least get them to the right place I don't think I don't think it it doesn't solve the problem certainly and the NCBI NCBI as a foundation for for all of the vocabulary is perhaps a bit of an overreach but it's I couldn't think of a better system that integrated well with with our search capabilities and so that's why it was used yep there anyway completely of this arrow that should be their example and somebody came up with something somebody decided to just put in something that wouldn't make hundreds so we wouldn't say there's a way to if that arrow is linked to it was a specific piece of data we would prefer that if if it is it and in that piece of data is either published or uploaded by the individual all right we would prefer that it knows it accurately describes what everybody else is seen on the paper however two results come in conflict then you can actually another you can actually get both an arrow and a tee going from this going between the same two biological entities and then when you click on one you see the evidence for you know if it's one entity increases another you see the evidence for that relationship but and if you click on the red arrow a red tee you would see the data that relates to this entity decreases this other end does that make sense so actually just one um I don't know enough about this but if you're using figures from published works like 108 kind of silly question probably but copyright issues is generally you hand over you you can't upload the precise figure so the relationship between these two the data itself I don't believe like formally copied and so but the if you were to upload somebody else's figure or I figure from another paper that we wouldn't consider that good but you can link directly to it and you can link directly to the ID then it goes takes you to where no III can't say that but perhaps we can get a marshal sorts let's see so what we're showing is that you can take the same system and through simple causal relationships recapitulated and as you mentioned there could be controversial relationships such as between lemon or solving autistic disorder and you can capture both pieces of information based on by by including both arrows if you get a number of papers that you know about the red will that get a current occur so yeah number of references will in the future be related to the tariff size or opacity is its best so in summary we are modeling biological pathways by redefining referencing to the individual experiment as opposed to referencing an entire paper that to describe what's going on between different biological entities so pub mouths publicly curated site that allows users to electronically publish individual experiments as well as reference individual experiments previously published and then automatically generated interactive problems addressed by pub now we think that improves communication by getting people to use the same vocabulary based on the NCBI with respective problems of narrative we allow individuals to record his individual experiments as opposed to require that they produce a full story and in terms of recall you can fairly easily store and share where this information is found future plans I mentioned scaffolding biological pathways building user community protect perhaps through Rackham or the MSTP for if anybody here would like access I'm glad to give it to them plan for the futures if you have an edu email he can get on its compute visual representation including size of pasady narrows as well as way down the line of literature for these different relationships because if we don't intervene at this level I'm afraid that this guy wins and so knowledge means talking with a koenig AV and beliefs my little brother's here this is us on Yosemite we made it Suman want to thank you very much for being a part of this project and welcome any other questions I'll seriously you about the lab music I I really like that idea so you're ready to kind of do all the things about access control sure backup off-site backup if you crash somebody's data uh-huh you're taking on an awful lot yeah that's true that's true and if it gets that large I'd be happy to have that problem two questions yes did you just say so your topic is redefining reference I would like to see is there any way like I can reference the interaction in your project instead of a reference a single paper to express the idea in the actual paper I mean you potentially you could each each each each relationship has its own ID within our system that's what I want to see yeah so let's sorry so does this causal relationship to 201 okay and so like if it were a viable system if it is a viable system then you could reference that individual experiment or series of experiments you know the causal relationship to hundreds of things okay second question would be so if this system is whywe and we get more and more data getting to that as as he monster he asks that we might have controversial resulting certain relationship I don't know whether you have any way to give the ways to different expression interactions especially like in a nowaday information retrieval have a lot of algorithms to processing this kind of graph based Network waiting to give some certain kind of a pseudo confidence for some published data interactions so establishing a metric for waiting confidence for relationships yes I think is a question that remains for us the sim the simplest and most likely simplistic version of that would just be how many figures doesn't show up in you know if this relationship is recorded by individuals ten times that it gets a certain way of waiting maybe a logarithmic based waiting to it but in terms of improving on that okay so because you're just measuring your slice that's there's a consistent gap between like the controversial discussion about certain interactions and the retrack retreats of the paper if if it's not if there's no rating or assessment system in this kind of you know interactions system it's hard to see how it can help this kind of issue I agree and it definitely so we use cytoscape web as the weighting that's how the visual representation is done and there we've looked through the different visualization and documentation there and there's certainly are ways to change the weighting and it'll be fairly simple to do if you want people to try this you're gonna have to get some help you have a documentation yeah they took a look at it wasn't clear to me I could make guesses from poking around it but sure know what are the lists of acceptable terms for relationships yeah so my idea for that currently is to take these exact graphs and then when you scroll over a or or tab into a field for this graph to pop up the sunshine people can and there but in terms of getting people started to just have this graph along the sides of the independent variable goes you need the documentation though the side of it I don't strongly because poking around and trying to figure out what's what substitute or a tutorial that's a good idea yeah tutorial sites planner sometimes contradictory experimental results are both correct but it's the experimental different it's different so live certain isms so where does that get entered into this somewhere let's see cells a lot of cell lines are accounted for medical subject headings within the NCBI as far as there are you can designate different environments as well different environments that are available to designate are in vivo ex vivo consultant slash tissue culture in vitro and then in silico or cairo if you're real old school and so let's say and so there are ways to distinguish between these as well as most stream that can have a huge effect repeat that screen of a mouse oh yeah sure cuz there certainly certainly and those information would likely fall in the description i you can specify if you wanted to look at a particular protein within a particular species you can certainly specify that as well but as you were saying about versus you know black states can behave very differently and therefore it be nice to have that information in there as well but at its root we're trying to get at least some information in there enough to make it a system that's worth using I think the different advanced features will probably come as as the system great this is some games traction so I would like to make a supplement to that question so other than cell line and experiments conditions also you might have mutated proteins mutated sequences and for small molecule binding and say that I have a radio labored small molecule and normal small molecules so so far I cannot tell that your system right now can handle that and actually when we are doing some natural language processing project we also have the problem when we try to normalize this term we cannot find a good way to express them in the database so do you have any idea about this problem yeah so one thing that I'd like to do with that is have advanced feature for you mentioned like possible I think you mentioned phosphorylation is a property or amino acid changes so mutations yes that's so different alterations there'd be an advanced feature for each if you used a special each gene transcript protein you could have an advanced feature that says mutated at this point phosphorylated at this point Isetta lated at this point you know that's those are the types of things that different types of things do this simple example you need happy if you have tonight oxygen and one species human isn't an effect most of your tissues but if you have say that oxygen destroys this homology in this bacterium is there any way to say but it doesn't affect it ah let's see so the way that this is set up presumably you'd have a figure and a letter related to each of those relationships and within and in the different species in terms of the larger categorization I do foresee a appearing like select a species and also and then look within a particular cell within that type of within that species that's how I think a good way of partitioning off would be because different cells also within the same species behave differently and so that's the simplest way that I've conceived of a partitioning and a lot of databases for partition things by supervised pieces as well so and then using medical subject headings made of the two to describe them yeah so I think in terms of you know that sounds like it could get complex and capture a lot of sort of complex relationships kinds of narrative how would you see you know imagine it's five years down the road and everyone's populated their data in the database uh-huh I would I don't know anything about you know your research how do I get a narrative view of what you've done so you would be able to sort four papers that I've done and see the relationships that be able to select those relationships and import them exclusively so what do I guess what do I see that helps me get a narrative out of those relationships as opposed to just a sort of another question just seeing a network of things how do I kind of a story or we don't be in this as replacing it but we view it as a supplement to it so that there certainly needs to be an in-depth discussion of what's going on however he currently don't see in any way any for people to publish small bits of data very effectively and this is one so far to understand correctly that so far you only return to the experiments published in fury yep or bored or things that individuals have uploaded themselves okay well right so how is that so you know if it's not theory okay rightfully said that peer review would you know publications but issues and you know sure they to be retracted if you open it up for anybody uploading anything what can you as a researcher sing about no no I think I think that's I think that's a valid point and I truthfully don't know the answer to that I do know that as individual of Harvard biologist submitted to three hundred papers a can entirely concoct a project with entirely concocted results with peer reviewed journals 1998 there was an individual who sent out two for I think it is BMJ British Medical Journal sent out eight glaring errors in methodology as well as interpretation and to two hundred of their regular reviewers and found nobody actually caught all eight and the average was less than two for peer reviewers and so I think the peer review certainly has a place but I don't think that it's I don't think that it's I think that if you do upload something that looks terrible then people will can cite multiple experiments that that show that it's terrible well then you you said your piece they said there's this Wikipedia everybody is losing it yes it cannot be cited as well so you know bigger source of information because you know what I don't like a new place if there's something which is absolutely incorrect agree reviews no perfect nobody's saying it is right but these things are complicated who's to be seen do it well so if you're uploading a method with every data point that you project or substantiate that's there's a peer review process has no better insight into why your method was than what you sent you send them a method no one's looking over your shoulder so the access to the peer reviewers in the access to the public it seems to me at least is identical in either case except my differences here anybody can weigh in when they see an experiment screw it instead of waiting for it to be published or being one of the six people who review the paper and three people you don't don't wait for it to be republished and then send a letter to the editor saying I think you should retract this you can you could comment on it directly so it seems like if anything this is a more transparent peer-review system it's not it's solving some of the problems of purity Beauty limited to two or three people who have other things to do and want to go to paper on their desk instead of these are people who actually care about the excellence of experimental interactions right so it seems like if anything it doesn't that I mean it doesn't have to be cited but you get exactly the same method that you would get in a peer-reviewed publication those people treat it less seriously yeah and I think I'm of that mind as well but in terms of how it'll actually play out that's very difficult to predict but would be that would there be a way to create a filter on it so that if someone really just wanted to see peer-reviewed interaction not just sure if it would have to have a PubMed ID associated with it and then filter out things that they don't have a phone any other questions okay well thank you guys so much for coming out
