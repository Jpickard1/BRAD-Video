hey guys welcome to the CC beasts in our series today we're gonna have Bing grin give a presentation Bing is really one of the pioneers and a lot of genome technologies that we use in genomics he's been involved the info project for quite a while and in the epigenome roadmap project and he his a lot of his research was focused on understanding gene regulation and the mechanisms of gene regulation and looking at epigenomics datatypes for example he was looking at enhancers and was one of the first people to make the observation that h3k4 monomethylation marks enhancer regions in the genome more recently he's been doing a lot of work looking at the three-dimensional structure of the genome with a lot of really seminal papers looking at the conservation of the 3d genome across species and looking at topologically associated the manes and those sorts of things and and his presentation today I think we're gonna hear a little bit about how gene regulation can occur through that 3-dimensional structure and Association of enhancers with genes themselves so really can y'all hear me okay so Thank You Allan for the kind invitation and introduction so I'd like to begin with this slides where we are all very much appreciated that we are in so this day sequencing months genome is now being done millions of people at a time but the real problem is trying to understand the meaning of it and we all know that the majority of the genomic sequences are non-coding coding and understanding such non-coding sequences in terms of their role in human disease and the human biology is it's going to be a major challenge today many of you I know study Kewell studies and you end up typically in a region of the genome that correspond to nothing and the saying the question is what does this non-coding variant do in this disease and that the typical hypothesis we have is that such non-coding sequences are attributing to disease by altering transcriptional regulation and there are numerous examples that support these ideas but to do this to extend this theory to general as a general approach there are some bottlenecks that we need to overcome why is that we need a pretty comprehensive knowledge of six regulatory elements in the genome we need to determine the intended target genes of those regulatory sequences and need to study how sequence variant fact the transcriptional potential of the targeting this sounds very easy but in reality making this work actually is involved actually a lot of data generation data interpretation and also functional arrogation study so today I'd like to introduce you some of the work that we are doing in the lab from three different aspect why is mapping this regulatory element second is trying to defy their intended target genes experimentally and third is to interrogate the functional consequence of a sequence if you delete them in high throughput manner let's start with mapping system elements as part as Alan alluded encode project which was conceived over 15 years ago was intended to identify this regulatory element in nagano Estelle was a pilot project where everyone focus on one percent of the genome by applying a variety of different technologies and that caught us a few things why is that there are several kind of this regulatory element we knew about promoters we nuke enhancer you exist when you insulate our sequences he exists but we did not know how abundant each Cal calculate of elements exist and we also did not know how to find them sequence of these elements were not sufficiently distinct enough for us to identify them just by looking at their sequence so we have to develop new strategies to find them so we and others as part of their parallel project try to apply different tools so one approach was to study dnase hypersensitive sites and that quickly turned out to be very effective tool right and by all regulatory elements in the genome my lab at the time was using chromatin modification marks along with transcription factor as marks for sis regulatory element and we come across the signatures between cancers and signatures but promoters and finding that CDC F as a reasonable mark for mapping potential insulator sequences and later arm this technologies initially developed using low-tech lawsuit techniques were applied combined with high throughput sequencing techniques now we are using now this combined chip seek or DNA's sequence are now being applied to many many cell types to review so the latest count of different kind of elements are kind of as shown here now we mapped tens of thousand motors nearly millions of enhancers and thousand of tens of thousand billion insulator and your insulation sites no recently we apply this to a mouse embryonic development as a way to learn how this strategy can help us delineate developmental programs so this is a study that we carried out in the last several years as part of the phase three of the encode as shown here we try to develop a comprehensive understanding of how development program is we pick eight developmental stages and twelve different tissue types from each stage some tissues some tissue can be obtained from earlier stages and men were not sampled others were not easy to obtain from later stages and were not sampled either but in total we profile chromatin States and the chromatin accessibility from each stage in my lab and and my collaborators jacquard that DNA methylation will pop out of each stage and pshew combination all the data has been released deposited to encode PCC where you can just download and perform analysis on your own here I'm going to give you some summary of what we have learned so far if you look at this Maps comprehensive maps you immediately get a sense of dynamic kumkum allocation of different being first of all if you look at some teachers specifically plus the things you're looking at different histone marks and they are present in the promoter or enhancer bleeding in different degrees this is a newer d2 promoter is marked by k4 trimethylation upstream of it is a strong answer marked by a for monomethylation a seller isolation this is a housekeeping gene you can see the general active marks localizing to the promoter and 836 fine Appalachian localized to the gene body ox locus is typically silent in this stage of development in the forebrain and you only see a 27-inch imac elation or if you examine across different tissues of the core of this gene you can see that this thing is marked by the active pumkin mark only in the forebrain but not very much in the other tissue except for some in hind ring and YouTube and hex who is a heart of mental regulator you find it in hard tissue exclusively for nodding any other issues you can also get get a sense of their mental dynamics by looking at for each tissue or listing in the tissue example your Deepu examining the forebrain you find that it's likely silent in eleven point five twelve point five but become activated after thirteen point five development and correspondingly its repressive mark a 27th 28th elation is abundant at visiting locus at eleven point by point by that gradually decreased thirteen point five words this is mile mouse in a bee chain this gene is active in the heart but in a developmentally controlled manner especially mouthing six it's active in the p 0 an early embryonic stage IV chain now I'm melting hydrogen number seven is active so there is a developmental switch between the seven to six upon birth so there is a tool called coma hmm that you can use to identify the combination patterns of histone modification and define common states developed mainly by anomalous callus the about five years ago so we apply this tool to every stage in every tissue and become out with a total of fifteen states of common ten that can be used as a universal vocabulary to describe all the comment and meditation data we have so the states three of them correspond to promoters active week and bivalent and five of them with dangku enhancers including strong enhancer distal or in TSS is though promoter cardinal and weak request enhancers or transcription states or repressive state and non signal and the distribution of each states are shown here as expect as I mentioned the TSS states are localized to the Egyptian star sites the enhancers are disputed repeatedly along the genome and the transcription state are in the king body lipid the description of termination side and the repressive the state k-27 are slightly enriched at the promoters while the k9 I'm at all are more diffused so if you use this vocabulary to look at a painted genome you can now see a very strong dynamic chromatin state in more comprehensive manner so look at gotta for Kristen must be interested in this gene you look at the gallop or locus it lit up literally in the heart throughout the development and it's become silent in virtually every other tissue except for livid in is intestine and that what T stand for this is another gene Gatton one typically active in central nervous system and you find it to be turned on developmentally time at dynamic attraction in the forebrain midbrain I'm doing a neuro tube but not in any other issues so in this pink color indicated polycomb-group SS state that we can see that both genes are silenced using polygon repressive as a mechanism in any other tissue so this kind of map immediately can help there are mental biologists who learn or come up with hypotheses about their favorite genes how they are turned on and turned off so in the case of gala for there are two elements that are annotated as proximal promoter a motor like and then a long stretch of sequences marked a yellow as in cancer or strong enhancers and then there is the region here that correspond to transcribe the region so you can basically guess that this gene is transcribed from at least two different promoters and with multiple clusters of enhancers driving its expression k-27 has been associated with transcriptional activation so by looking at where they are what we are trying to see is where determined local enhancers for example now we can take this regions marked by k2 and seven peaks and ask do they respond to tissue specific enhancers so my collaborator lanfen a CEO at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory perform transgenic assets by taking this predicted enhancers tethered with a reporter reporting and injecting into the embryo wait until the development stage eleven point five and perform the staining look at reporter explosion so in in nearly every cases when you have such a strong enhancer they would Iraq explosion of that recording in the tissue where you detect such enhancers activities for example in this is the lending cancer and we predicted it will be in Lin but the reporter and the reporter shows that it's active in the limb this is elements that are showing activities in hang going mid bring your tube and indeed when you perform reporter assays this is patterns that corresponding to these regions and this is a this is a forming specific element and indeed the staining of that reporter shows or during specific activities and this is a heart enhancer and we've done this for several hundred predicted enhancers and those predicting cancers are ranking into several categories the top 1500 the mid tier from 5.15 thousand to the top 1500 from 1500 to 3000 and the yellow 3800 k-27 'silly asian levels so the top tier appeared to validate much more likely with nearly 60% of the element driving reporter in the blight issue and with nearly 80% of them driving a reporter in some tissues not necessarily in the white tissue if you go down below 5,000 1,500 to 3,000 or lower the validation rate drop considerably indicating that the levels of a 27 the stronger the more likely this is a very active enhancer once you drop the lower levels the chance that it served sufficiently high level and answer also decree so this type will be information will be very useful for biologists to interpret this maps when you see a very strong statements elevation map you can put that into perspective how likely it's going to be validated using this transgenic mice acid we also perform chromatin accessibility assays using a taxi approach I won't go into details about this method it was developed by William Greenleaf in Stanford a few years ago it's a very quick and easy way to look at chromatin accessibility so we apply this to the same tissues on stages except for the 10.5 and attained nearly seven hundred twenty thousand elements in any one tissues and this is a comparison of those elements to the human genome with roughly seventy percent of those elements that we identified chillin conserved the sequence in human and of those conserved with our sequences we found roughly so out of this total forty percent are also identified as candidates this regulatory element in the human by DNA's accented assays but then we discovered also nearly thirty percent or two hundred thousand elements that were identified as potential sis regulatory element sequences are conserved but were not previously identified in human genome as hypersensitive sites so you can look at this as potential new functional elements that were defined using this acid because this were looking at the developmental stage that were not previously studied in human where you can look at this noise but I think the fact that the sequence conservation is high indicate that a lot of them if not the majority of them are likely functional animals and then we asked our this potentially conserved sis regulatory element enriched for she was hit the answer is absolutely yes this is a table showing different tissue and the developmental stage combination so the color the letter the color them hired enrichment for specific traits such as in the top here these are engaged in forebrain midbrain and hindbrain the nervous system related enhancers and the type of traits that we fund being reached in this category are also related to nervous system such as schizophrenia occupational are teaming and I'm down below here electro-thermal theory so attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bottom here these are elements highly enriched this Ireland in the liver and if you look at the kind of disease that he was hits enriching these kind of liver specific enhancers you are finding a lot of clasp metabolic pathway traits cholesterol triglyceride for example that are engaged so what they suggest is that a lot of the symptoms that we study in human they probably have their development who origin in terms of as a root of their initial is the pathogenesis so the other data are being released having released either encode PCC portal you can download from this website and essentially this is a what you see when you first log into it they give you their convenient view of assays and sampled organisms and this is a table that you can basically click and download all the data now as I mentioned there had su this type of effort there have been millions of document identified literally in the human and they're now in the mouse genome and this elements are showing strong enrichment for sequence variant linked to human trait and disease and this support further the hypothesis that non-coding variants contribute the disease through regulation of the image now the question follows is that how do we move to the next step which is to find what genes they control and this we take advantage of well first of all why is this question relevant it's because a lot of examples have been reported that the gene and its enhancers can be far apart sometimes as far as a million base pair and and certainly have many genes in between so it is not safe to always assume that enhancer activate the gene next door so but the question is how does gene how does it enhancer element act over a distance it's now well accepted that DNA actually can both and allowing the enhancer to loop back through the targeting through spacial proximity and therefore they can I'm coding even though the linear distance is part can we take advantage of this looking between hands and promoters to identify targeting of enhancers and that required us to understand how spatial organization of the genome is compact it's a range in human cells we have a yoke Dekker and a grass Lieberman to thank for developing a powerful tool called quantum conformation capture also known as I see this strategy requires fixation of the cells with formaldehyde and then digestion followed by ligation in a proximity ligation reaction who allow two sequences that are close to each other could be ligated together and isolated and then this can be sequences in Mass to give you a genomic view of interactions each dot here represents a frequent frequency between two sequence element zooming in and turning this 45 degree you will see this patterns of local prompting practice which regions showing very high intensity of interactions followed by another domain and they are separated by a short boundary and we call this logically associating domains because they are defined by the spatial interaction of the deal it turns out that such domains provide a very nice framework well understand how transcription is coordinated in a genome this example shows that the boundaries are essential for hopper gene expression patterns during development if you delete boundaries for example in this locus what you end up is a developmental defect that has cracked Bracco technically resulting from ectopic activation of developmental regulators such as back 3 due to the deletion of the boundary so such examples illustrate that maintaining the chromatin organization is crucial for proper gene regulation in terms of mechanism such domains are considered to form you to a pair of players cdcf and cohesion it's because the boundaries of Tad's logically associated domains are enriched for this transcription factors DCF and also the cdcf binding sites at the boundaries tend to adopt convergent on patient making them essentially very possible to form this spatial arrangement cohesin is a range shaped a molecule that could grapple on this tooth trend of DNA and cohesin also it's known to interact with cdcf so so according to one of this model this cohesion and Traverse the genome in this update direction and they will stop at the city CI binding sites while doing that the intervening sequences are extruded out and forming its own domains so so that's how genome is arranged and we know now that such topologically associa no mains are very stable doing cell deficient and it's the same cell I'd always have the same type of domains even different cell types can have a largely overlapping set of pads indicating that they are very stable dr. while development with intact there are loops that you can identify for example if you use high resolution analysis by sequence their Maps deeply you can actually see regions that are having local high frequency of interactions that are separated by regions that are not as highly interacted this we call them loops and finding loops typically or in theory should give us the idea about how enhance and promoters are interacting one approach that we have recently adopted was to use capture approach to engage for promoters from the hi-c library and a sequence only promoter centered hi-c interactions so this type of data requires a bit more computational effort so when we get the data it's almost like hi-c imagine this hi-c type of map but it's highly biased about motor regions so we have to is remove experimental biases due to our admin lens due to the probe capture efficiency and also consider the distance dependent signals so we need and then we calculate a probability ma value whether the interactions the observed frequency of interactions are unusual so when we do that we can identify many many promoter centered interactions in the fibroblast cells as shown here and when this is compared to the high-resolution hi-c data you can see that in large part these two are quite similar in fact this is a statistics similarity between a promoter capture hi-c versus hi-c data is very very similar compared to random controls so this gave us confident that using the emotive capture hi-c we obtain essentially same information for each promoter compared to a whole genome I see but at only a fraction of the cost of the 10% so this gave out the power to analyze dozens of key issues obtaining enhancer promoter interaction Maps at the at the cost that we can bear that we apply this to 27 cells and tissue types but which we previously analyzed as part of the roadmap epigenome effort so that now we have both epigenome maps and promoter centered interaction lab or the same cell type same tissues and altogether we are finding about nearly 300-thousand enhancer promoter interaction pairs at a great looting about by pillow baits the medium interaction distance between any pairs is a 140 kala base this pie chart shows that out of this 300 thousand pairs of the interactions almost 7 percent quote done to promote a promoter interacting 36% with banku sorry 56% sorry 37% correspond to promoter enhancer like interact heads and then nearly half respond to interactions between a promoter and regions that not yet marked in that tissue so there's potentially a lot of sequences that may play a role in the genome but not yet identified by pumpkin based analysis how let's just sis within the local comic n how reliable is this data let me show you a couple of examples we use eqtl that the expression quantitative trait as a Guan truth we look at one region for example B LDL or by eqtl it has a sequence about couple hundred kilobytes away that are strongly associated with the expression variations of this gene in the in heart and by looping analysis we found that these locusts specifically loop through the promoter of PL PL r so there's another region here that has slight local area treatment and then there is another loop that we identified were not supported by the L analysis when we compare this in a multi non-white fashion we're finding a tremendous amount of overlap between eqtl and the loops that we identified in the corresponding tissues and by random control you'll find much less overlap but fewer overlap so this indicated that there's a strong signal that were captured by the looping a say this is you know two other different tissue types the same type of EQ PL analysis as data generated from the Tea Tax important co2 strong overlap with our capture promoter enhancer in fact this is another view of the data showing that in these this gene that are typically expressed in hippocampus there is a strong promoter enhancer interactions that are highly that are detecting the hippocampus but not in most other tissues suggesting that tissue specific interactions in this case could correspond to tissue-specific expression so this map obviously in theory should give us indication of targeting the potentials he was hit indeed or we examined some of the known us kids that have been well studied in this case it's the PIO locus it's being shown that appeal locus actually that correlate with obesity is controlling two genes our x3 and i are at five and in our case we found very strong loop interactions between these locals and both genes in multiple tissues so this give us hints that we're finding are indeed potentially useful another indication of the reliability of this is using focusing on this unexpected set of interactions involved to promote it 7% of those potentially quotes down to a pair of things where their promoters are are spatially close the question is are this real where are these just due to our experimental heart attack again we first examine whether the promoters that are interacting with each other are showing activities that are correlated across the same set of tissues and indeed you can see that there is a very strong Pearson correlation of different quantum marks between promoters that are shield spatial interaction compared to random pairs of promoted they suggest that indeed there are potential correlations between these transcriptional correlation between the genes or promoters that are interacting in space second evidence is again shown by eqtl analysis here is urging that PL cap that shows Dom promoter Canole interactions with another locus EHR age and now if you look at the eqtl data this region that include that he h rh is actually a strong equal PL returning to the BL cap activities so when you compare all the promoter promoter pairs that we identified by a motor capture the hi-c with eqtl there is a very strong over overlap compared to random expectation so what this means is that we are indeed finding two signals using the promoter captured assays that can be verified using so this map how do we use it to study human disease and trade one way we do this is by first cataloging categorizing all the traits over 700 and 900 CM categorized into groups that share similar set of genes based upon the snips so this is a heat map showing those 30 groups of tweets with each group they share this sniffs identified by the two our studies have have the targa genes that are overlapping strongly with each other which this Pearson correlation showing showing up here very strongly compared to random so so this what this gave you is if you look at so here cost of one are traits that unnamed here Graves disease Patrick disease so lay it so we ask at Pig arthritis this appear to relate to inflammation the second category that share very similar genes that using this map are Parkinson's disease ADHD Alzheimer disease frontotemporal dementia example it's all related to central nervous system so what is this better than just using near the gene as a predictor this is how if you use the nearest aging the p-value that you show such enrichment is not as strong as if you use the putative targeting so this is for cluster one if you look for functional Richmond enrichment of functional categories the top category is peripheral blood local site very strong in English but if you use just the nearby genes it's less less Raleigh the second category systemic lupus with at Hostos this also is more highly more significant if you just use the nearest being to conduct this analysis so what this tell us is that you use this map you're more likely to uncover the true biological pathways then it's used the next thing neighbor so using this map you could now analyze pathways involved in pathogenesis of different of different traits so the category 11721 29 shown here appeared appear to share similar pathways that are enriched in there QR snips and C 4 and C 4 T they also share similar pathways that are involved in blood coagulation elaborate activation and so on so the proposal is to use these maps to really identify common here the pathways among different disease and use that information to help us devise strategies to treat dependency that's obviously going to be a lot of work ahead of us in C R in summary this line of work will give us candidate targeting or potential cause of genetic variance and help us understand the molecular phenotype from a large study obviously many questions remain and I won't be able to address them in the near term a lot of the questions that we try to study is provide functional data for elements that we identified using this - food approaches and here I like to introduce a method called quest seek which stands for sis regulatory elements can by tau deletion and sequencing this involves using a pairs of a pairs of guide RNAs expressed in single cells in parallel to create deletions and we can generate thousands or tens of thousands of such different pairs such that each pair will delete a overlapping sequence in the genome for example we pick this locus we can design the deletions and they are basically covering this region in 20 both coverage the strategy involves you make such a deletion design generate lentiviral factors that express to guide RNAs delete and introduce double stamp breaking and with one or two kilobytes apart you introduce this lanta virus into cells that are in a culture in a point one altec lissa T of the infection so that each cell received no more than 120 viral particle and after selection for those transacted when infected the cells you've sort based on the equation of the targeting in this case the targeting that we select or validation of this strategy it's octave or where the one of the two alleles has being attacked with TRP so that we can use PRP expression to tag a to monitor the expression of our aquifer in that allele in this experimental system we focus on human embryonic stem cells with this tag octa-core and designed 11,500 70 pairs of guide RNAs we generate on average 2 kilobits long deletions every 2 pairs every pairs of deletion that are next to each other overlap by 1,800 base pairs so till they have sorry 1900 a start so that's roughly 100 base pair step sizes and the 20 X both 20 fold coverage this design allow us to interrogate each element multiple times oh it's pumpkin and the step size gave us the resolution whether the element is actively not to screen for this we impacted the self with the Lenti viral vector grow the cells and then screen for those that have lower yep equation but maintain regular levels of the aqua port so that we ensure that the cells are still quite potent because the other copy of about Kippur is still expressing a normal level so this is the cells that we isolate so they're no longer a plus ya P but the other copy of the octopus still functional as a control if you look at cells without infection very little cells made these criteria we also identify high TRP population as a as another control so this when we then we sequence the insert of the 90 viral bacterial count how many times a particular guide RNA were enriched in the VIP low population versus a control total population and that is parted using this MOA plot where the mean rate conscious on the x-axis and y-axis is showing the coding Richmond the ones that labeled red are those that considered significantly enriched in the VIP low population compared to this control and they're about 500 of them this include all the primers are which guide RNA that designed against the VIP gene itself shown here as the green circle as an active control we designed guide RNA the same sequence but lack the ham sequence so that they don't in target specific DNA and they're not showing strong Richmond only two out of 500 was showing up so indicating a low-cost enacted rate as a nother control if you look at the high VIP population you see this this lap population now shows depletion in this idea dish this is absolutely consistent with in being required for the EPI expression and if you knock them out you won't see them to be highly represented in that idea t cell become this is a map to show all the design guide RNA pairs and this is their abundance how many times they were bought it yeah this is the ones that we show as I enrichment and this is the octa-core locus as it's expected out the poor locus there are many deletions that would affected extraction but then there are many other Lopez's shows a lot of this guide RNA pairs to identify systematically regions that have a functional important for our core expansion we designed a the following test we use first enacted binomial to rank all the guide RNA pairs from top to bottom based on their enrichment levels and then we identify those genomic regions where multiples of such guide RNA pairs are found to be hiding rate and this we use a robust length aggregation has to show essentially whether there's a strong bias or overlapping guide RNA pair deletions are in in the top of the rank and that p-value and departed and basically run through every hundred base got all the p-values and regions that show such enrichment is the strong bias out here as high at this region that don't show any enrichment of guide RNA parrots are obviously no signal so you can basically so basically the original map of guide RNA pairs now and be added annotated using this signal map and showing that if we didn't have many guide RNA mediated deletion that has very strong squirts it's another region that you look at score here and here this region I appeared of a high density of such functional regions as identified by the classic and if you lumen you can find that many of those Peaks are actually regions found by transcription factors in the human year cells or showing by a showing Association who acted on marks as we have expected with regions to be this is summary of all the regions scored as positive a total of 45 regions were scored as positive by this acid meaning that they are necessary for optimal octa-core expression and their overlap with active quantum marks are shown here so all together all but five of them are associated with active on pin marks or transcription factors or paltry this arm on mark the region's a small minority but still a significant minority indicating that this assays is capable of uncovering regions that are not annotated by biochemical signatures another region that to pay attention is that nearly 40% of this positive element was done to promote it this was this came as a big surprise because we typically think promoters only care about their local neighbors they don't worry about anything else but apparently these different promoters when you delete them and contribute reduced after for expression so we want to do validation to show that this are really two positives not both arted and to do that we we design the following acid we design a pair of guide RNA generate clones of cells where the deletion occurred in one of the two alleles or both alleles and here's the phenotype you would expect if you delete the enhancer from both allele via piously will be low if you delete enhancer from one allele that correspond to the non tag reversion you won't see a reduction of VAP if you delete this enhancer from that hacker version you will see a reduction of so so we selected six elements for validation using this approach and they're marked at here and in each and every case we see a reduction of TRP expansion when we delete the element insists but not in trends the SIS element deletion is showing the yellow and the trans element deletion is showing in red and you can obviously see in every case the green one is lower and shifted throughout the lower yet P side compared to the red ones this is a facts plot showing individual cells yeah key question we did this into time point points 25 days after we did this basic experiment isolate individual clones do the tax warding another is 50 days and interestingly one out of six we show a reversal of the peanut head where the SIS deletion no longer show a reduction of a deity but in every other case the reduction is robust and persist so we named this kind of element as temporal enhancers meaning that deleting 13 answers have a temple in it have this region respond to all those unmarked region that we detected by this assay but they were not marked by any it was not marked by any of the active comp and marketing factor binding and you can see that deleting these sequences without being that we robust reduction of aquaphor exposure three of this tested elements correspond to promoters so we initially deleted a 2kb sorry 1 kb segment of a motor and the reviewers asked oh that may include proximal promoter regions so we then delete the core promoter of 200 base pair region in two different ways so that our deletion is not causing off-target effect and in each and every clones are we isolated the syste lesion always resulted in a reduction of via peak compared to the trans Alisha indicating that motors indeed are in this case required for optimal operation this is not due to the product of those genes because when we did RNA I we can reduce the transcript of each gene and protein levels of each team but without reduction of octave or expression so this is likely because the element is required not 13 product so how could it is possible I think one hint hint from analysis of a three-dimensional organization so this part shows the average ligation frequency between octave for and each of those alum promoters that show hosted classic signals and the green gray shows the genome average for between promoters and its neighbors and what you can see clearly is that out of those 17 promoters that show a positive basically requirement for alpha for expression all but 3 are highly interacting with aquaphor in terms of spatial distance another way to look at this is when you try to predict which promoter out of nearly 300 genes in this locus our opt for dependent are regulating alcohol so we design a random forest predictor by incorporating data such as hi-c and the transcription factor binding and a quantum Mart's and when we do this we can predict the which promoter to be active very actively lucky by roughly with ROC 0.9 so and then we design we drop off each feature individually as which ones are more important are required for the accuracy and the first and then rank number one is I see it's by far the largest single predictor a motor being required for alcohol but this suggests is that spatial interactions between in between the promoters of octa-core and promoter of other genes are our defining feature of this emotive required for activation so what these functional studies taught us is that we can now design unbiased strategy to identify enhancers in it you know and and show that actually a lot of promoters and act over a distance to control genes that are not even related to that function this axle-back who the emotive remote capture studies where we see a lot of comodo promoting clashes coming together we argue that a lot of transcriptional control in the genome is controlled by such a motor motor interruptions so I know I'm kind of exceeding high so in acknowledgment I like to emphasize several key players so the first encode study I presented were led by David working and one of your own product yang Xiao dong and you and our graduate student and who very hardworking research associate the single cell taxi which I did not have time to go to is listed here and comma pain reactions was done by Antony Schmidt and a postdoctoral fellow in Kong who has now have his own lab in Korea and quest seek was invented by yaw radial long Chien Fong and dingy and we have our collaborator could sink and also funding agency here thank you for your attention [Applause] happy to answer any questions I have gone through too quickly yes back over there you we haven't investigated that question directly but there is evidence that that requirement is not there let me show you this example here yellow cap is actually not expressed but sorry I think but this is the interaction that shows up in iota sorry not Bianca Bianca basic blast here it from the knackered strand but gr th RH is not expressed and yet it shows very strong interaction so it's possible but not definitive in this case that the promoter of the thr age may be driving the El capital T flash but I take this I mean there is a caveat so of the 17 promoters that we identified that are required for optimal Gulf of Aqaba explosion there is a strong correlation between their activity in terms of transcription levels with there being driving being required for budget so so I would say there is a strong preference for Dean to be turned on for them to be also used as regulatory element that are spatially close but not absolute I shared at like transcription factories are they localizing have you visualized them by like maybe DNA fish they colocalization factories together and this is why you see these interactions yeah III think that's while my models to explain this I think spatial interactions may be consistent with being from the same transcription that RNA polymerase Factory we haven't been to establish techniques to visualize them in live cells it's really hard but I think that's that's a very plausible explanation I'm back over there you yes so the first question is the T's do you think this distal regulation and did person mo regulation are mutually exclusive no no but but there's a I think they're mutually exclusive meaning that they can occur at the same time but in each cell this is there's always a dynamic so the enhancer may talk and interact with this whole motor and maybe first second and then the next enhancer may come in and kick it out for the next second so so yes if you look at a duration of time oh so the developers along this is tier now if you put this into perspective when you to latch in division actually you're changing the RNA structures so how does that come into play when you try to explain these kind of distal regulations yeah so so to lool out the gene product as playing a role we use RNA I to reduce the gene product and we did not observe a tongue regulation of so that's that's one piece of evidence we have against yeah really Brenna's talkin kind of curious for the octa for example when he deleted any of the other genes promoters TC effects upon the promoters other than of aqua so is there yeah we did look at another gene PLC and we did not see that being affected so the h our a/c is not urging that is about a hundred kilobytes away even though some of these promoters are hundreds only 500 or 900 ill about a way they're not affecting the HLA so in one case you say there is a temple enhancer do you study this in cell culture right what you know can you explain I mean what's the mechanism Holliday attempt yeah yeah temper temper enhancer was fun yes in this system how does it work like I have a picture so there have been always suspicions that each individual enhancer probably can be compensated by other enhancers in the same region so deleting single enhancer are not expected to have an effect and I think in in our case we were fairly surprised actually deleting any of those 25 regions did be through effect right but in the tamping hence ER what I suspect happening is that the fact is compensated by other enhancers extended period of culturing but obviously for some other enhancer when we delete such a fact was not compensated so we're not very sure what's the difference between this category of elements that wise compensated other it's not all right thank you thank you very much oh it's my great pleasure
