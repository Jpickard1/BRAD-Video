in dilute and Crowley the solution which is a very hot topic recently in the field thanks so much young for the invitation to come here and also for your kind introduction what and actually do is to tell you some of the work in a recent work in in the lab this weenie protein association so we have been interested in this problem of a protein association that is the the formation of complex between a protein and and the other either macromolecular or small protein molecule targets so we've been working on this for quite some time and and so in particular we'll be working on structure prediction for protein complexes and and also some work on analyzing the physical factors contributing to binding affinity but today i'm gonna cook her some the kinetics of protein association that is the calculation of rate constants of association between proteins and much of this work has been done under knut conditions is many studies of protein directions are but more recently would look at what happens in when this sociation occurs in a cellular environment so many of you probably know that the cytoplasm of bacterial cells and as well as the inside of organelles of eukaryotic cells are highly concentrated with with different kinds of macromolecules so this is a David Kerr cells renditions of the cytoplasm of e.coli and the point of this pictures to show that the spacing between neighboring macromolecules for example between the ribosome and your neighbor rabbit um for example it's less than the size of a typical macro monarchy and so the question is then does this crowding environment affects the physical properties of protein association structure equilibrium and and kinetic properties and so I hope you have some time to tell you some of our recent work in this context now most of you probably know that that when a protein folds into a typically iturra structure many of the nonpolar or hydrophobic groups uh barity in the in the in the interior whereas polar and most of the charge of groups are exposed on the surface and the charged groups can either arranged in a way such that they form stabilizing pairs of opposite charges in some cases but it was in other cases you may have a case where a patch of light charges it is a cluster that so that it forms a binding site for a opposite charge protein so that they can have a electrostatic attraction between the protein molecules and and I'll show you some of those examples later on now we now know that that the proteins function in the in the center of the contacts that not typically not in isolation but a rather through interactions with many other macromolecular in a small molecule partners and so just to make this point for example let's consider the example of protein synthesis so we know that the fences new proteins occur on the ribosome involving the large and small subunits of the ribosome the transfer RNA as was the messenger RNA leading to the release of the of the new protein but this is actually is a highly simplified picture of what's going on a more realistic picture involve actually involves many many other protein factors so so the information involved initiation elongation as well as their release typically the process of installation is really limited by the first step that is the initiation so if we look at the Univision process and you do it further we note that we now know that the initiation itself is relevant it's very limited by the binding of the messenger RNA to the small subunit and and that process is helped by three initiation factors I have one too I have three and and part of the reason for the three-nation factors is is to help speed up the blending of the initiation charnae to the small subunit so there is actually a problem here in that not only the initiation trna but also all the innovations RNA connecting all bind to the same site and so so and without initiative factors they've all bind to the small subunit with more that's the same rate constant and so therefore there is a high probability that that you may have a wrong turn a that's bunk to the subunit and that obviously can create promise with with errors in protein translation and so the problem is largely solved by the help with the help of the three new heating factors so with the 3d here factors the rate constant of the cognitive Carinae is increased by three ones magnitude so that it's basically genetic competition that's won by with the help of the Unison factories so the examples like this specifically in this case suggest that it is the distinct rate constants of association that really helps the efficiency and accuracy of the of the translation initiation process and and so there are this and many other examples suggest that that often the about chemical processes are under Connecticut as opposed to stubborn dynamic control and therefore the study of the surging and Prosser's both the rates as well as the the mechanisms are essential for understanding the physical basis of biological recognition and and so that is in sinchon the motivation for us to work on Masterson and and the mental techniques choose to characterize mechanisms and at a rate constant of protein association now if we look at the observed rate constant of approach of protein association we find that the rate constants span a very wide range about 10 orders of magnitude so there are complexes that are formed at rate constant that approached and depends pomona per second there are also complex that are formed at rate constant around one per mole per second so there's this ten orders of magnitude difference and so the long term objective of our work is to develop computational methods that allow us to for each given complex to predict its associated constant and and so I hope that I can convince you that we've now solved about half of the problem so rate constant that are higher than tender force promoter per second and now we have we think we have a pretty reliable bustling room and an accurate their method or making rate constant calculations now to understand this math the computational method we need to look into the process of assertion little bit further so for two proteins to associate to form a stereospecific complex obviously the first thing they have to do is they have to come together and and and not only they have to come together they will also by that by the time they come together they also have to form have the relatively the right orientation as well as the close separation and it is such a intermediate along the pathway of Association we refer to at the Trenton complex now once they reach the trend accomplished they have forgotten to go further conventional rearrangement and tightening to form the native complex so simplicity we can divide this whole process of Association into then two sub steps the first day is the process of reaching the transit complex this is done by translational and rotational diffusion of the two subunits that's followed by further confirmation of rearrangement to form the native complex now potentially both subsets can be written limiting and it wouldn't capture the two steps in a simple kinetic model so in which we have the two subunits protein a and a protein B they formed this Trenton complex by diffusion now once you form the trenton complex this complex can either dissociate to the two separate subunits or it in further undergo conformational rearrangement to form the native complex so the overall rate constant of Association is then determined by the rate constant of the three any mental stats and so in the this simple four manner were the overall rate constant ka again is determined by the three rate constants now as I said of both sub steps going forward it can be potentially rate limiting so if the second step is very fast that is you have fast conformational rearrangement then the overall association will be limited by the first step the educational encounter and and that is what's called the diffusion limited regime conversely if the second step the confirmation rearrangement step is slow then the overall association will be real imitated by the second step and and so the problem that behalf of the problem that we think will have a solution falls in the first scenario where the confirmation ring rearrangement is the past that is the diffusion limited regime so in this regime we have developed a method that we refer to as the trends in a complex theory and and we use this to predict both the rate constants as well as the mechanism of of Association so the the basis of this rate constant prediction is this simple analytical formula that we derived based on manipulating the diffusion equation that are governs the Association Prosser's needing to the diffusion process that leads to the formation of the trended complex so in this form in ER we have a pre factor this ka 0 this refers to we call this the basal rate constant so this is a rate constant by which two subunits would find each other to reach the trending complex by pure random diffusion that is without the help of any external or in intermolecular interaction and then this process can be enhanced by the presence of a long-range network static attraction and that help is captured by this ultima factor in which the energy is the United Stated interaction energy in the trenton complex so to implement in this method then we need to do three things so we first have to identify the Trenton Plex so roughly this trended complex is a located on the outer boundary of the of the native complex energy well so so that as soon as you reach the trended complex that puts you at the at the border of the cliff into the native complex well so that you can very quickly go down this energy Fano and reach the native complex and and so we specifically we identified the trend the complex by mapping the energy surface of interaction between the two subunits by treating the subunits as rigid so that will only have three translational degrees of freedom and a three rotational rental rotation all these degrees of freedom so we map the energy surface in this six dimensional space and I don't used to identify the trend and complex and then once that's done within calculate the basal rate constant that is the rate constant at which the two proteins reach the transit complex by unbiased diffusion and when do this by simply simulating the translational rotational Brownian motion of the subunits by doing what's called a Brownian dynamics simulations and the discrimination that can be run in the past because we don't have to calculate forces that that combines the diffusion of process and then we capture the you natural state contribution by calculating the United States rating energy within the trend the complex and we do this by solving the so called across on Boltzmann equation alright so a bonus of this approach is that this for Manor cheese's out the true contributions of the of the search and rate constant so we separate the contribution over the basal rate constant this is dictated by diffusion of processors oh that's a damn bias the diversion of process and then the natural static contribution so instead of you know alternative approaches you simply get an overall rate constant here we can separate out the contributions so that we can gain a better physical insight into the factor that that controlled the magnitudes of assertion rate constants and then I'll point out yeah the benefit of this of this decomposition so and a significant Lee one benefit of this decomposition is is it's a currently in our understanding of this wide spectrum so so very briefly we can separate the whole spectrum into two halves the diffusion control or diffusion limited regime and the competition to change limited regime and the boundary between the two regimes is of the of the water of alternative or omona per second for rid constantly about this decides and then in the diffusion limited regime we can further separate into a region where the rate constant is of the word of a tenth the first and the sixth pomona per second and that's the range of basal rate constants that we typically update or pain so those are the rate constants that you would obtain if two subunits associated without the help of non-rainy next row static attraction so for example antibody protein and have protein antigen and antibody binding typically fall in this range and we can infer that that antibody maturation is probably not guided by maximizing associate rate constant but rather by optimizing prep affinity whereas there are cases where the rate constant there were not many cases where the rate constant is greater than this basal rate constant and that can only happen with the help of non-rainy net aesthetic attraction so so whenever we have a rate constant end of the seventh pomona per second will higher we can infer that that these are seasonal systems where there is a strong unit or static and it's characterized by opposite charges across the the the binding interface so you would have one subunit that's a highly negative charge and one subunit is highly positive charge it across the interface and this surfaces represent the the unit aesthetic potential of the two subunits so red means a negative charge and blue means positive charge and so so anytime we have a rate constant that that's that's higher than in the seventh per mole per second again you can you fer the presence of units strongly net aesthetic attraction and and often we can argue why the charges are costly in this way because now you have to realize that classroom a lot of my charges is actually not good for the stability of the subunits so you can actually increase protein podía stability of individual subunits by neo taking some of the positive positive or negative charges and and so therefore there has to be some kind of biological region for the cost for you know of charges the two subunits and often one can identify such biological reasons at least one can propose such biological regions so take for example this is a well-studied system bond age and a bar status is an enzyme this is a protein hibbett opal this is the enzyme that cleaves RNA so it's a nuclease so this pair of proteins are produced in in a type of bacteria and Bala is is produced as the cytotoxins it's basically a protein toxin that's released by this bacterium to cure off competitors so it's basically a will a young a weapon that's used to to its own advantage but if you think about it bit more than there is actually a problem here because if it eclipsed RNA then the first RNA potential it is protein and see is there on a of the of the producing sale so therefore the producing sale has got a problem of self-defense it has to have a very good self defensive mechanism for it for it to affect meiosis this weapon and that comes in the self defense come in the form of this protein a bitter past are so in the perversion self as to proteins are actually co-expressed and then very quickly form a complex and then is the complex that's created to the outside and then they dissociate and then gets imported it so that bond is you can do its job so so here is a case where it's not the affinity of the complex that's important is the key here but a rather is the rate constant forming this complex because you can have form very high content with a very high affinity but if the process is very slow then some of the bond is monic you can escape and then target the the RNA molecule of the of the producing cell so that the cell would die so many other means similar reasons can be inferred for the all this other systems and so so this suggests that there are biological reasons for this high speed in Association this examples so I want to now show you some examples yes it's both yeah because the non range in a static attraction would both increase speed decision is speed up the process but also pre warrior yes yes it is Green I'm Kirk long-range so you have to define what's not long-range in all cases basically of the water of up to 10 angstroms so basing the protein sends each other at a distance about 10 angstroms yeah so that comes if you that's actually a very good question so that comes from if you look at this formula this formula applies only for very stereo specific Association so if you have a nonspecific binding like two spheres touch each other the effect of a nonlinear tracking is very minimal it's only we have very stereo specific interaction then you have this bottom a factor so basically three words the magnitude basically requires a free energy of about 2/3 kcal per mole so so so that's that's how you can get this this significant speed up all right so so the first example I'm gonna show you is is the binding of a enzyme a toxic enzyme that targets the whole ribosome so it defines to a specific aside on the ribosome a particular AR nail a loop of the ribosomal RNA and and once it forms this complex to this particular site then the enzyme keeps the RNA and so that now the ribosome is inactivated and then protein synthesis stopped so so it's a highly toxic protein so this this protein is of the same class of something that he might have heard in the news there is a in the past half a year or so in the new set there is a guy that's sending ricin laced letters to Obama and other people so the so rising has a protein that harmonicas to the system that we started basically acts in a very similar way Park the same the same loop this loop is actually known as a saucy rising loop and and the protein that we started here is rising rather than awesome I'm sorry it's ours and rather than rising and so part of the reason we want to show you this example is exactly to make a point of that our master is not limited by the size of the system so we can start the whole ribosome and and so so so we we can basically in fact we study any associated process involved in any macromolecular complexes but as the second reason I want to show you this example is that this is a system where the observed that is mental immersion rate constant by a group at ucsf is the highest that's ever recorded exceeding to the protein 10 to the 11th from ona per second and so the measure boasts the association of the rebel toxin to the intact ribosome as ways to the isolated ribosomal RNA fragment and so the binding to the RNA fragment is is in line with rate constants that measure that with other protein protein associations so this is of the order of about 10 to the seventh come on a per second whereas the intact finally to the impact the ribosome is now even higher than that by for the magnitude so there is this additional fourth negative boost from the presence of the of the ribosomal context and and the part of a raisin walnut study this is so that we won't identify the factors that contribute to this additional tan for what the magnitude radians minute by by the ribosome and and so since as I said we can choose out the different contributions then we can figure out the various factors that's contributing this factor and it would find that that half of this forward a magnitude about 104 come from the fact that you have this railroad ohmic contacts as an aide so the rebels owe me it's a largely negative charge because of the the ribosomal RNA the phosphate groups on the backbone of the RNA and the rubber toxin is positive charges of this long range nonspecific additional in eco static attraction but there is a second that the second in fact that's a more interesting in Masato and that has to do with the fact that that the levels of the ribosomal protein neighbors ribosomal proteins modifies the binding interface so this is the representative configuration of the trendin complex for the binding of the rebel toxin to the isolate to the isolated our intrepid Omar and a fragment now if you place this treinta complex in the prep in the context of the of the ribosome then one sees that you have clashes between the rebel toxin in the neighboring ribosomal proteins so therefore the transit company has to be modified and and so and and the modification is such that there is a rotation so that a counterclockwise rotation so that now you avoided the crash and have you can fit into cracks in neighboring ribosomal proteins and and this reorientation of the trends and complex what it does it positions the positive charges on the on the rebel toxin very close to the positive groups on the ribosomal on the Via Roma RNA fragment so so that now the unique aesthetic attraction in the trended complex it's in further increased then what is in the icin in the case for the isolated ribosomal RNA fragment so so so you have a concerted effort but both from from the short-range effect by modifying the binding into it was the United States all T Network static attraction that accounts for the additional hundredfold increase in the in the rate constant when you compare binding to the ISO need a ribosome fragment to the intact ribosome so that's that's example that demonstrates the the importance of the natural static attraction it was the finding interface the shape of the binary interface and and I think those two factors probably account for when looking into how the initiation factors these three initiative actors increase the rate constant of the of the messenger RNA binding to the small subunit the the three world magnitude I think so quantitatively we think that the combination of unique aesthetic effects as a modification of binary interface can account for this this kinds of difference but again we need to do cognitive calculations to establish that so I want to now yeah so this you can so you can you can describe the enhancement adds a example surface diffusion yes you basically it's it's with the with the help of the of the United Stated attraction the the two subunits basically stay longer and and the by by attaching to the neighboring surface so you can model the process as they were talking at in dimension energy yes all right so the second example I'm sure is the the binding of cytokines into cytokine receptors so we've got into this problem so it's a kippah Konya cytokine has two binding sites a high affinity and no affinity one and it binds to two receptor molecules in the so that it induces dimerization and the and a conformational change within the dimer then leads to activation of the of the receptor and we got into this because we looked at its Pinto data for the binding rate constant so for what different cytokines Arisa point and I so looking for human growth hormone and prolactin they have very different parts but the structures of the cytokines are similar they're all Hynix Pando proteins and also their receptors are also honey harmonicas and but the rate constants differ by about force magnitude so we were first of all curious as to what explains the binding rate constants and we'll also wonder whether or not there are biological reasons for this difference and so so so they're structures and this is the binding for the hive finding rate concept for the high affinity site so the since we have the structures for this complexes and so we can easily view our trends come based calculations and we'll find that the basal rate cons are very very similar they differ based in vice we fold and it is really the unique aesthetic contribution that comes for this difference so so the United study in directing energy in the trends Acamas the deeper by about five kcal per mole and and that decision account for the difference of this forward magnitude change and and if you actually look at the único static surface you can easily see why we resort can be so different so you need the highest rate is for eco binding to its receptor and in this case we find that that Ipoh is highly positive charge and the receptor is the honey negative charge so you have strong unit aesthetic company impurity in the other extreme natan we see that pronation does not have any strong you know static fascia basically it's a mixture of positive and negative the semolina for its receptor and so simply the looking at the unique aesthetic surface gives a physical explanation and then the trench company basically gives a quantitative explanation so so this again suggests that it's it's the unique aesthetic difference that accounts for the difference in in observed rate constants now and then the second question you will wonder was was why there was such a difference in rate constant above this for structurally related cytokines and and so we were coming up with guessed different kinds of reasons but but none of them would set in factory so we raised them maybe since Ipoh would involved in producing lot cells and therefore maybe you need faster so she can't reproduce enough plus cells and then pronation maybe you don't and so finding a way actually it's as I said it is this it's not very satisfactory in the finally we looked at the circulation concentration because we looked at because the biologic process you don't really directly care about rate constant it really cares about the binding rate rate and the banner ad is of course the product of the rate constant and the retina concentration so you can get the same by new rate by either having a high rate constant or having a high protein concentration and if we look examine the circulation Contra over the four cytokines won't find that the there is strong anti coordination beauty rate constant recognition concentration so people with the highest rate constant is a present at a very node at a peak homeowner concentration where is prolactin with a low rate constant president ten nano molar concentration so there is so basically we form the product you've basically find that this product is born as constant and this finding radius is essentially enough to so that if you if you give her the half-life of this process and this half lap is over the water of about an hour and that's about the time that a half-life of the of the receptors before they are degraded so that this rate constant to basically tune is so that is fast enough just to escape before the receptor is greater than a day and inside shifted by playing like by compensatory changes oh the rate constant and the dissemination concentration so so therefore the change of rate constants allows for the variation in the in dissemination concentration that's that's basically the best recommendation that we come up with now we've since we calculate the the rate constant and in doing so also calculate the the structure of the trenton complex and as I said the Trenton complex is on pathway intermediate so therefore if we if we identify the trends and complex and we simply draw a batter from the trenton complex the native complex then will confer the transition the final transition from the trended complex to the to the native complex so that would infer a magnesium model for receptor activation so by by calculating the structure of the trenton complex and then doing this simple interpolation we can come up with with motions that are important for the final step of the of the receptor activation so this is sort of a mechanism model that we develop based on the calculation of the trending complex so so first fine the high-affinity site and then the low affinity site and then in doing so you have relative rotation of the two subunits and then the rotation then means the two there are two kinase subunits that are attached to the interested in domain and this rotation results in the they close enough of the two kind a demonic use so that that allows the two kind among molecules to transpose foreign aid and in the transformation then served as a signal for activation of the receptor all right so so we've now since we've done lots of tests of this method and we've not actually made automated at the implementation of the trend combatant and and the event into a webserver and so basically it takes as input the structure of the native complex and and from that then everything is the connection is automated you can basically enter your your protein structure and then get the rate constant I know Barriss group has actually used this method quite a bit of where I can have now this webserver up for now about a year and a half and we have a significant number of submissions to this web server so if you're interested in in testing this out this is the URL doing that just to add to your advertisers method a bit so so this is a set of examples that we would run through the web server this is set of 49 protein complex for which we found it's been two venues for the rate constants this spanned five words magnitude ranging from ten to the force certainly not nines and above Pomona per second and we vary in the structures of this camp of this complexes to the web server and this is what comes out and so we the prediction is is of the water of the accuracies of the water about five to ten fold difference from the observed rate constants and this complex is the span different biological functions as well as different structures and most of this this complex are ready to rigid but there are also cases the world we connect near apply this masseter to flexible subunits as an example this is the case were the pro the one of the proteins is actually partially disordered in the in the unbound state and this is example cured in binding binding to from B and and so we're depth our method to the binding of just water proteins and we simply caught it is water putting into fragments and and we'll bind the fragment of one at a time and the fragment that gives the highest rate constant we predict that as they over also a rate constant and the reasoning for that is is we think that the different fragment combined to their respective sites in impaired no pathways of course the most controversion would come from the pathway that as the eyes of rate constant and and so so we refer to such a type of binding as the talk in the core last if you have this finding of a of the high rate fragment followed by the coalesce of the slow fragment and so in this case the disorder then allows the protein to to escape from the sphere or intentional streams if you if you were to bind this whole subunit as rigid as a regular subunit and the rate constant will be very very low so by having the two the fragments flexible and disorder then you can have still have this kind of a high rate constant now so we would look at this talking to collapse mechanism and wonder whether what it applies to other disordered proteins and it was on there that actually none of other sweater proteins that have been started experimenting will also follow this talk in the coherent coalescent mechanism so this is a system that's started by which the caracas group and what they found is that that if you if you cut this into fragments defining that one fragment the internment of fragment has the same rate constant as the whole lens protein where the the c-terminal fragment had the red consonant is three water from agony lower and and that is precisely what we will we predict using this fragment based calculation Transcom calculation a different system that started by peter writes group is the binding of peak hit two kicks and and here they actually proposed a model that similar to a conical as they found it that in the in the process they form the truth of in the form intermediates in which one enix is formed the first and then the second unique form such subsequently so i think so we think that this the the talking occur less mechanism is a general mechanism that a coffin it's the binding of just water proteins in many cases with now actually now in addition to this anemia we examined a dozen or so other systems using this fragment fragment based trench combinations and in all these cases that we explained mental results computation so so we think again that again suggest that this is the talk in the colossus is a general mechanism now there say a number of now the study of just water for tea has become very popular and and there are a number of theories that have been proposed as to why this water exists in in in proteins and so some suggest its allows for promiscuous binding others suggest it's for allowing you can have a low affinity binding and so so we arguing none of this seems to make too much sense for example promiscuous binding in fact and now we know that's actually a bad thing not a good thing in fact if you look at there is a recent science paper in which the expression levels of proteins were examined and they found that its water proteins proportionally were expressed at a lower level and our explanation was so that you can suppress precisely promiscuous binding so you wanna actually that's something that you want to prevent as opposed something that you want to promote with just water so so anyhow we finally this this this fashion and we came up with with a new theory and this is based on kinetics as opposed to thermodynamics now and the reason that we formed this kinetic argument was because if you think about word what functions typically it is what a proteins fulfill they typically are involved in regulation or signaling by forming complex with target proteins now this kind of targets complex information you would afford the IDP to work of course it has to be behind in specific as I said from Miss Kitty exactly bad thing at the same time the combi has to be short-lived if this complex has a very long lifetime then basically you you you lose the switch like function either constantly off or you're constantly armed so so so you have to be complex to fulfill three requirements high specificity as well as short lifetime now those two requirements in a way are are contradictory to each other because if you want a high specificity how do you achieve high specificity you can get you higher specificity either by very easily by having high affinity now having high affinity means you either have high on rate or low off rate right now the hierarchy there is a limit to how how much you can increase the on rate as limited by diffusion so so typically the if there isn't without the help of you natural state enhancement you are limited at you a rate constant about to the six promoter per second and so if you want high affinity net let's say an animal in a binder then that means you have to have a decision rate constant of 10 to the minus 3 meaning that your your half-life for the complex is about a thousand seconds and that would not that would put you outside the range that's useful for sickening what regulation so there is an now this is dynamic conflict between short lifetime and a high specificity now what happens if you make one of the subunits disordered okay what happened then what happens is because now the protein is disordered that means that the dishwater state is more stable than the hypothetical water state right and and so therefore you you lower the free energy of the unbound state and by ignoring that the free energy of the unbound state you increase the effective the apparent dissociation constant so now instead of nano mana binding all your life my Cremona binder and now with the same assertion rate constant now your decision return is only about one per second so so now that puts you in a half knife about a 1 second so that put you in the range that's permissible for sickening world regulation so we think that the disorder that yasur's the Association which is target it's both highly specific but but also short-lived and then we think that's unique function of intrinsic disorder alright so I want to move on to briefly about what happens when when so here in occurs in a in a crowded cell like an environment so as I said already earlier that biological processes protein synthesis folding binding aggregating the or occur in a context of high concentration of by standard macromolecules and the question is whether or not well how much the this crowded environment affects the various component I mean in the kinetic properties so now potentially this is a very complex problem and and and so we wanted to see whether we can still use simple theories to model such a process now in the in the case of ascertaining dilute solution because the both species are present at low concentration so therefore we can use a pair based approach to model the association process now we'll have high concentrations of Crowder's then this becomes a complex in anybody problem so the question is can we still use a pair based approach to model this process and so we examine at this this question and we think they're exactly hope that maybe you can still use a pair based approach because the tippecanoe won't have recommended crowding the innovative the concentrations of the individual species for example the direct and protein species are still at a low concentration it is the aggregate concentrate the total cons we know kinetic or monikers that's high but individual spins are still low so as far as the rectus our concern there are still at a low concentration so you who can somehow model the effects of the Crowder's you know in a mean field helped away with maybe can still use the pair based approach so that so we examine this this question some years ago by using a very simple system so with somebody have a box of hot spheres that doing the Brownian motion and then with their the spheres are otherwise identical with something in label one of them adds our protein a a few others are protein B and then the rest as Crowder's and then we whenever a sees that B then we we assume that they form a complex and the system dies so we business monitored the the lifetimes of all of the assistants repeat this many many times when look at the the lifetimes and then from there we calculate the survival probability and then we'll compare data with a pair based a theory and this is a comparison between the simulation result and the pair based a theory prediction and we find that the theory actually works out pretty well and what you need to do is is to account for the effect of the over the of the Crowder's and there are two kind of effects that we accounted for the first is the fact that when you have Crowder's then the product induce and effective interaction between the reactant molecules and so we introduced an effective interaction a second effect is that the diffusion of the wreck the ready diffusion of the wrecked and molecules is slowed down by the presence of the of the crowded so they have a harder time to find each other so now those two effects are in terms of effects they actually oppose each other so the slow down slowing down of diffusion would slow down the erosion process or the effect of interaction effectively you induce attraction between the rectum on accusers therefore that will speed up the the association so the so those three effects could potentially cancer each other you need to a a modest net effect and so so so anyhow can account for those effects by modifying our a trending complex theory so now the basal rate constant will be modified because as I said the diffusion slowed down so we simply introduce a new diffusion constant that's slowed down by by by the presence of the Crowder and then in addition we introduce a effective interaction that's induced by the Crowder's and so so in this way we can commutation account for the effects of of Crowder's and so no to calculate the Crowder induced interaction we proposed what we refer to as a post processing approach so the best I'll give you just very briefly the basic idea so so you can study it's burnt only the binding in in that erosion and you can study the finding in in in a Crowder solution and then typically to get the crowd in fact you basically calculate the difference in the binding free energy for example so that's what you can do to prevent only now in computation we don't follow the horizontal path but rather we follow the vertical path to as explained certainly this will avoid expensive calculations so we simply take the among state and transfer it to the project's notion and calculated to transfer free energy and it would do that for the bump complex as well and then and if we take the differences of the two vertical path then we would end up with the same free energy difference so and we refer to sit at the post processing because we simulate the unbound state the bomb State and then post process the simulations by transferring them to a crowded solution and this is something so so once we do the simulation that we transfer it to the crowd as low and each time we'll calculate the interaction free energy from that by I'm fridging the different trick the the transfer to different sites in the cloudiest notion we get the transfer free energy and so I applied this calculation to a system that the study expla mentally by didn't arrive school and and they found so the measure of the binding of two proteins Tam and a blip its prohibitor to form a complex either input in empowering the presence of tag or what that train as the Claudian agents they found that the observed rate constants really don't differ significantly among the different systems now we know that the presence of pag and it actually is going to reduce the associate the diffusion constant of the two proteins by about fivefold so if diffusion the the reduction in diffusion constant is the only effect then we would expect this process of what the assertion rate constant will decrease by fivefold but because the crowding also induces an effective attraction so that compensated for the effect of the slowing down in diffusion so the net effect then is really no and that's that explains what happens what's observed experimentally now that's not to say oh the effects of according to always now so if we look at for example binding affinity then there is no compensation from diffusion because this is a convenient property and we do predict a increase in binding affinity and it this is a comparison of our theoretical prediction it was our with our own mental measurements for the binding of two subunits of the DNA polymerase one complex so there is enhancement by by doctrinaire the crowd in aging and the amount of enhancement in binding affinity is different depending on different species of so so hi i'm one i can aware that trina this morning in fact when it came to a lower one that can away dextran for example so think along to wrap up with with a few concluding remarks i've showed you that with nevada this trends and compa theory that that we think provides a practical solution to half of the association problem the half that that has rid constant that's greater than terms of course promoted per second and and were working now there were many half that involves a conformational change in the Association process diffusion regardless of the weather or what regime you fall it's always sets a upper bound on the association rate constant and this bond is over the water for about ten to six per month per second but unique aesthetic attraction can bump up this graded by three waters of magnitude so that you're not very wide range of midcontinent and we've seen that that this wide range allows proteins to fulfill its various biological functions and finally also showed you briefly that it will also study computation in extreme antonius ocean and the crowded conditions and so our current efforts are devoted at board realistically mimic in the in vivo conditions so with that I want you now need to the people who did the work tonight for support thank you for attention yeah with respect to your last point that you're simulating it is basically the country intuitive idea is that they can find each other with some kind of magic attraction potential but isn't that much more reasonable to say is that they are just in a cage and so once they've found each other is then they can't when they diffuse your part again is they will really associate it's because they can get away from each other isn't that the explanation explanations and a magical attraction force page effect is not gonna work because what matters is when you have two guys that are separated they have to find each other in the first place okay so so the kind of process that were interested in this our diffusion limited so it so what the slow step is really find each other it's not how long this together so that they they don't separate no but once they separate you stake they can recombine again when they are in the cage it's very reminiscent of what happens in in in in a biacore machine that this is where things diffuse into the lair you can stay is this you've diffused further down delayed or slow the association is but it's that's slower but the rebinding is faster as well and therefore the kinetics is not affected very counterintuitive no so so the EKG pack would slow down pieces will not speed up association again because a socially permanent by the process that bring you together bring the dramatic they rebind the rebind this is a rebar the Rabine is still is the same thing the rebinding is still need to go through this diffusion process no your you just can't get away because the other molecules are around you so I mean very simple with the test your idea is to introduce a short-range attraction uh-huh and you're not model and and we've done calcaneus if we have a short-range attraction that's not going to have it's going to be fact let me ask the question what is this magic force them which makes them so correct so it's not a magic force and so you think it this way so if you have two subunits compared to situation one they're very far apart huh the other if they are bound in a complex in a crowded solution the two guys are separate apart would have a larger truly Diwani whereas when you have a complex you have a small X with no volume so therefore the complexes are more comfortable in a crowded area solution so it's not a magic force this is the well-known this is in some surface called a depletion force so this is not some kind of magic voice will connect in the calculator it is force so it's not something some magic okay when you expect that and when you wanted your diffusion that it is also affected when you have these highly charged specific interactions that sum or diffusion is changed and when the highly charged molecule diffuses through solution that it's actually slowed down due to its high charge so the the presence of macro monitor kanya fact the unique aesthetic attraction in different ways and a simple way this if that can happen is when you have the financial constant of your solution is changed so I prune a highly concentrated protein solution will have I know where the fact if attacker constant relative to water so therefore the attraction because of the the decrease in it in the diet constant you attraction is enhanced but at the same time the charges on the proton day on the bystander proteins can also contributed to the effective varnak strengths so that can also so you have this sort of contracting saying that because there is recently being a simulation of protein cytoplasmic a crowded such Pleasant nothing there showed when they take into account these electrostatic interactions and they can achieve like the same order of magnitude diffusion coefficient inside the cytoplasm as opposed to when they don't do it right yeah I think that's a yeah the understanding the diffusion constantly in a crowded environment that's that's a very active area of research i don't yeah it's it's yeah to get it right is actually very very difficult whoa what are you saving the effects of like physiological ionic concentrations in this cell and the macula clear like the crowding effect yeah so I mean we if you mean by an akan strange Nene and a hundred fifty million Mona returns of the year so we actually usually start at wide range of on extremes yeah for example the The Binding of the red Watson to rebel zoom we actually we went all the way from I think about ten minimal and all the way to about 700 mini motors so we usually span a wide range you on extremes so I guess I'm sort of returning to my previous question and Eric's question so the range of the depletion interaction is the size of the deplete ins right so again it's not enough to speed up the center of mass diffusion by tons right so our remember so the density are only oppressing about 10 angstroms so the Crowder's besides is of that same about 10 20 or so it is now ranging in the sense of I great so if it's speeding up your reaction rate it's not doing so by getting their center of mass as close to each other faster because that effect is linear in the in the radius of the capture radius and you can't get a big effect that way right again so the Fed comes because you have stereo specific binding so is true if you simply have to uniform you reckon spheres you're not gonna get this kind of effect right so so but but then I think that that's exactly the cage Eric was talking about that what's going on is that it's keeping the centers of mass near each other longer so that you can find the right orientations to bond is that accurate that's one way of I don't disagree with that so but but to say that that that's the only thing is simply preventing from dissociation I don't that's probably not accurate yeah so I think you can okay so when you make your calculations for binding affinities you're starting from the crystal structure do you know how much likes if you made small deviations to the crystal structure does it affect your calculation so our calculation what I showed is for a dollar data g that is the effect of crowding on the binding free energy on the binding affinity so we're void by precisely we know how canina binding of absolute value affinity is a hard problem so we don't follow the that's why we avoid bothering the horizontal past because that's what it would have to do we follow the vertical past so that we something look at the effect of crowding on the initial state on the final state okay so the so forth pose I think the question is more random if the question is directly at how if we calculate rate constants using dot or imagine model structures how accurate is and and we've done a key number of cases like that in fact the the the example of the redwood Hudson bomb through the ribosome their second your hamaji based model so so and yeah yeah so we have used hamaji models and an attack models for rate constant calculation yeah so we've examined a few cases of that source also there was a recent case where we used a Monte model to get the trend accomplished and then we found a very recent in there is a new structure came out so we did a new calculation so so the basal rate constant with Bonnie's deferred by about two fold and then the the united state country is very very similar precisely because part of reason its robust because the trend in finding company the two subunits are separated by about layer of solvent so it's not very sensitive to the precise positioning of the side chains yeah so that so so I think yeah that will be very sensitive to to the structure of the panel complex yes okay great and we different definitions of this water I think one definition it's worried operationally you can determine whether or not a protein is disordered by something measuring for example second structure because there's no second structure then one can imagine there was no tertiary structure so there are different ways of defining whether or not a protein is disordered and usually this is explained Tony it's pretty straightforward it simply uses mesh using the circum tag make a second tourism measurement and find there is no second structure great I'm happy to see that this great talk generate a lot of discussion and but we are sighted running out of the time so we will stop here in this thing he came for one chance [Applause]
