And I know what\nyou're thinking: \"just 48,576 more to go\nbefore the next big milestone!\" And indeed, I'll hold off proper\ncelebrations until then. But, you know, seeing that seventh digit really\ndoes make you reflect on what led to this point. And if I'm being honest, a lot of the growth for this\nchannel just had to do with some very kind people\nsharing and promoting the content, both in terms of certain specific\nshoutouts from creators with big audiences, and in terms of individuals\njust sharing with their friends, so what I want to do now is take a moment to let\nyou all know about a few other math creators online who I think you\nwould like a lot. There's just so much good creation that\nhappens under a lot of people's radars. First up, we have the channel \"Think Twice\". I honestly have no idea why this channel isn't\nbetter known among online math communities. It contains these really\nbeautifully done math animations, and if you like this channel, you're definitely gonna like it. You absolutely get the sense\nlooking at any one of these "

Naturally, this often takes the\nform in some very pretty geometry or some algebraic results that\nare explained geometrically, and the focus tends to be a little bit more\nshort form and bite-sized pieces, so if you ever want a quick little\nreminder of why math is beautiful, This is just a great\nchannel to pop over to. Here, let me just let a couple more\nof these animations just play out. Next up, I'd recommend you check out\nLeiosOS, run by James Schloss. what I like about James is that he seems to think\nfirst and foremost about community, and creating content seems to be more of\na vehicle for bringing people together online. Let me turn things over to him to explain\nwhat it's all about, both on and off YouTube. "

We're just getting started and it's\nobviously an impossible goal, but that's half the fun. This means that we cover a range of different\ntopics and here are some clips of the videos. Any light that enters a lens leaves on the other side\nof the lens with the same angle it came in with. it's almost as if the light\nnever entered the lens at all, and hence the name,\nthe invisible lens. If we take any arbitrary matrix, say, the identity\nmatrix with zeros along the \ud835\udc64-dimension, the rotation doesn't\nlook quite right. This is because most tesseract\ndepictions use stereographic projections, which resemble the act of holding\na light source behind an object and checking a shadow\nagainst the screen. Here, we divide our points into smaller packages and\nuse the Graham Scan to find their convex holes. We then take the vertices from the\nholes and plug them into the Jarvis March "

Quickly, I would like to thank Grant for\nmaking such amazing videos on 3Blue1Brown. It's inspiring to see such a\nlarge and dedicated community attempting to understand\nthe true beauty of mathematics. You guys are honestly amazing, so even if I don't see you guys again, please keep being such\nan awesome community. Grant Sanderson: For my part, I think it would be\nawesome to see this algorithm's archive grow more. both of the last two, at least on\nYouTube, have shorter form content, So, next, let's switch to a channel\nwith more of a long-form focus: Welch Labs, run by Stephen Welch. Now, I suspect many of you already\nknow about Stephen's work, for example, the excellent series\n\"Imaginary Numbers are Real\". But there are many other great playlists from the\nchannel that you should absolutely take a look at. In fact, one of the things I like\nmost about this channel is that Stephen thinks in terms of series\nrather than in terms of individual videos. And each one of them includes clear\npoints where the viewer can engage "

To get a feel here, let me just play some snippets from the start and then\nfrom the end of his \"Imaginary Numbers are Real\" series, which should give you a pretty good\nfeel for the style in the scope, and I'll also throw in a snippet\nfrom his series on machine learning. Stephen Welch: Algebraically, this new\ndimension has everything to do with a problem that was considered\nimpossible for over 2,000 years: The square root of negative one. When we include this missing\ndimension in our analysis, our parabola gets\nWAY more interesting. Now that our input numbers are\nin their full two dimensional form, We can see how our\nfunction x\u00b2+1 really behaves. Our function does\ncross the x-axis, We were just looking\nin the wrong dimension. So why is this extra dimension that\nnumbers possessed not common knowledge? Part of the reason is that it has\nbeen given a terrible, terrible name. A name that suggests that\nthese numbers aren't even real! "

[upbeat techno music] So, why does our green path start out at one\nlocation on our \ud835\udc67-plane only to end up in another? Simply because our green path leads\nus to the other layer of our surface. From the perspective of our \ud835\udc64-plane, it appears that\nwe've returned exactly to our starting point. But actually, we haven't. The \ud835\udc64-plane is just a projection; a shadow. In reality, our path has led us to a\ncompletely different branch of our function. [typing] This is a decision tree. Right now, it's learning. "

Let's test it out. With the help of a\ncamera and a computer, our decision tree sees exactly\nhow many fingers were holding up. Now, depending on\nwho you are, the fact that a machine can perform this\ntask may be completely mind-blowing, not all that out\nof the ordinary, or may not even be\nall that impressive. The good news here is\nwhichever camp you're in, you're in good company.
