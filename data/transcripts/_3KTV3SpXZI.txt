good afternoon everybody it's my pleasure to introduce today's speaker dr frank zhang is currently a postdoctoral fellow with the title flat iron research fellow in organs kaya's group at the simon foundation i think he works at the flight iron building in new york city frank has previously received a bachelor of science degree in biological sciences from the dojo university after that he came to the us at ucla he received a master's degree in statistics followed by a phd in bioinformatics and then now he's pursuing his doctoral training he's worked on initially machine learning and statistical method development for prediction interpretation of human molecular genomics data and more recently is expanded into more cutting-edge neural architectural machine learning methods for automated application in of deep neural network in genomic data and today the title of his talk is deciphering human disease by big data analytics and automated machine learning uh well let him start and then at the end he's either submitted a question in the chat or i'm new to yourself we'll go from there okay frank you can take it away okay yeah thanks for the introduction let me share screen first okay i'm asking you you can all see my presenting presenter review and um i'm really happy to be here virtually to present my work on how i leveraged our big data analytics and automated deployment to decipher human diseases so as a computational biologist my research work on is on the intersection of different statistics and biological data analysis so there is little doubt that today's biomedical research has entered this era of big data however the conversion of those big heterogeneous data into biological knowledge and insights is still challenging in general my overarching goal is to accelerate this process with interpretable and unbiased modeling approaches and my current and fast research spent several different fields including deep learning method development for regulatory genomics gene regulation on both the transcriptional and post-transcription level and how i use the cns to model genomic sequences and predict warranty checks uh so for the more particularly uh for the deep learning method i'm really excited in exploring those automated deep learning methods recently so this refers to a rhythmically designed deep neural network architectures with little or no human interventions and prior to that i've been developing methods of deep learning to analyze ra alternative splicing on a gene regulation of a post-transcriptional transfer level i've been working on methods to analyze protein rna interactions wiring modification science during my phd and more recently which i'll also talk more about it today is how we analyze the immune response to source co2 infection and finally we can leverage those convolutional neural networks to model genomic sequences and they integrate the genetic virus and i do this on both above tissue level and on single cell level so as you can see here my research really expands both normal computational method development as well as our biological data analysis and i think that's important that's an important interaction to have to enable this better analysis through normal computational method development and also the experience of data analysis will again inform the next generation of our methods develop development and uh today i will mainly talk about two projects the first one is about source code to infection um on the transcriptional and post transformer level and the second is how i leverage your automated uh deep learning to interpret variations of genomic and the molecular profiles and since as brian mentioned earlier this is a hybrid recruiting event i'll wrap this up with outlooks and future directions from my research so without further ado i'll start with the first story of today which is how we try to understand the sex differences in source code to infection so the copenhagen pandemic has been there for around two years and that's the main reason that we're doing still doing this like hybrid virtual event and across the globe governance has caused numerous staff and if you look across different countries uh male sex is a significant risk factor with uh a lot more male patients uh any option icu's or diet due to complications of copenhagen and this base of the basis of these sex differences has has been explored for therapeutic implications so for example several prostate cancer drugs have been repurposed as an attempt to treat copenhagen patients however the study of sex difference is highly non-trivial mainly because the presence of confounding factors so on the molecular level we know that males and females have a very different hormone responses and that can that exist before the infection and may also play the role during the infection of fighting against the virus and aside from the obvious molecular differences males and females also tend to have a different social and environmental effects uh they also tend to have different comorbidity ratios and all those structures together makes the study of sex differences in response to copenhagen highly challenging so to answer this question we leverage a unique cohort called covenanting confliction response former rings or charm in short so the charm study followed more than 3 000 u.s marine recruits longitudinally with weekly symptoms screening pcr testing and antibody tattering more importantly this is a big collaboration between the u.s navy labs several clinicians at the mount sinai and several research groups across multi institutes and we have the molecular profilings that exist before they are impacted their healthy controls at the time that their first time tcr positive all the subsequent pcr positive and after they recover from this infection because they are marine recruits they are receiving this military training and are living in the same environment and that there are young and healthy adults without strong comorbidities all those factors taken together this really makes the charm cohort an excellent resource to study that how sex plays a role in the response to copy 19. so we first started by looking at the symptoms so a large proportion of our cohort is asymptomatic meaning that they have positive pcr tests from this their nasal swabs but they don't experience any of those cognition symptoms but if you look at the ratio of asymptomatic across different sexes they actually differ significantly in particular females are significantly higher to have a symptom due to the virus infection and this is the case across 13 different symptoms that we recorded and for each symptom females are always more likely to report the symptoms this is also true for fever which is measured instead of self-reported indicating that this is not simply due to a reporting bias at the same time we can also measure the viral load measured by ct values so here note that higher ct values will correspond to a lower viral load and we can see that females actually have a lower viral load compared to the males despite the fact they have more symptoms so there's seemingly contradictory clinical outcomes really motivates us to study the underlying molecular differences that contribute to these differential clinical outcomes so that we analyzed both uh differential gene expression and differential alternative spicing using the cell using this cohort separately within males and within females and we were able to identify a large number of specific molecular signatures upon infection and in particular this one gene really caught our eye so ptprc is a gene you know protein keratin uh phosphotase receptor family and this protein product is mostly known as a cd45 so the isoform variation of cd45 has been considered as a marker for functionally distinct immune cells such as activated t cells or membrane t cells and upon the infection of uh starch of two we see that only in females like these different parts this control first time pcr and subsequent pcr we see that only in females the axon 6 inclusion level is being upregulated versus emails this inclusion level remains constant because axon 6 corresponds to the extracellular protein domain of cd45 this is functionally important and marks a distinct immune cell alteration that is restricted in the female cohort we can also see a widespread sex differences on the transcriptional level so for this purpose we focus on set of genes called interferon stimulated genes so in short interferon stimulated genes or isgs are the genes that are triggered by the by the interferons and provides the host defense to find a god to fight off a wide range of pathogens uh if you so we compiled the list of our 361 isgs and uh performed this gene set enrichment analysis by comparing during infection samples to the baselines and indeed we see that for both males and females these isgs are being significantly upregulated upon the subsculpting infection this is uh expected because those are the post-defense genes that you will find out this viral virus however the extent of upregulation is much much higher compared to the males and if you look at this enrichment score and this p-value is highly significant so we can also further summarize those 361 isgs biolithium factor analysis and we can group them into four reproducible latent variables that are reproducible across external cohorts so the first one is type 1 estrogens that are the genes that are responsive or triggered by interferon battle type 2 sgs are the genes that are triggered by interferon gamma and the third one that is highly expressed uh in neutral fields and they would denote them as neutrophil associated so interestingly you find that for those four reproducible latent variables these are even higher before the infection remember that for this unique heart we have the molecular profilings before the subjects before the subjects are infected and comparing the healthy males and to healthy females we see that this antiviral isgs are even higher at the baseline level before they're infected so taking those two factors together this really indicates that females have a stronger antiviral defense to start with and this defense is even more upregulated upon infection that might contribute to why females have a better outcome in coffee 19. so now i've told you different pieces but we really want to wrap this up with a with a full picture so to do this we perform this causal mediation analysis so i don't have the time to go through other technical details but briefly causal mediation analysis is a statistical framework that leverage this potential outcome framework and we can use it to analyze the mediation relationships between three variables here those three variables in particular corresponds to those biological sets sex the immunity of pre-infection and the molecular and clean conditions differences post-infection and now i've reported a simplified version of this results summarizing this graph and now the real task we we have done is much more complicated than this but briefly uh we were able to reconcile some of these known relationships for example type 1 and type 2 isgs are triggered by interferons and if you during infection you have a higher interferon you're more likely to experience symptoms such as fever so this also explains my our observations earlier that females are more symptomatic is simply an indication that their immune systems are working and this is the same if you get a vaccine aside from that we found that the pre-infection interferon gamma triggered genes will actually reduce the viral load upon function but this is marginally significant so we use this dashboard to represent it finally this cd45 splicing vibration that is only seen in females is mediated through this higher neutrophil associated genes and interferon gamma again before infection so here although this graph is mainly focused on the gene expression levels of issues we can argue that the splicing of cd45 is apparently also functionally important by marking this adaptive immunity and they also exhibit this strong sex difference pattern and indeed in general iron splicing is a primary contributor that links the genotype to phenotype variations in this landmark study publishing science a few years ago the authors performed a careful analysis to understand the sources of complex trait violations and they concluded that for some of the traits the contribution of mra gene expression level and splicing are comparable or even as larger from the spicing side at the same time how those splicing vibrations triggered by the immune response to find out stars called two infections still remains elusive so that red plot wraps up the first part which is the sex difference story and next we will perform a more detailed analysis of ra splicing in itself cohort so can functionally characterize those spicing events by plotting their molecular changes upon this infection so here the x-axis are ordered pre-infection refers first piece of positive subsequent piece of positive and post reflection they're ordered longitudinally and at each line represent one particular splicing plant we can see that there's a large number of splashing vibrations being regulated upon this surface cove two infection this dash line represents the average across all those different different differential spikes and events and we see that the largest molecular difference is triggered when subjects turn the first time pcr positive we can also analyze which of the genes are differentially spliced and indeed we see that the genes undergoing differential splicing otherwise involves a neutrophil degranulation viral process and some protein trafficking which are all will contribute to the immune response so taking all together this demonstrates that splicing vibration is a core component that is accomplished by the immune response especially happened acute and fast to help the host to fight against the virus infection so since we have this non-trivial splicing vibrations we ask that to what extent we can generalize these sebastian vibrations as bell markers to help us uh predict which a copy 19 versus negative control so here what we did is we can compile a logistic regression based on those splicing markers and we can use it to predict uh the probability of impacting so once one is your infected and zero means your healthy control and one particular subject really pops out this subject x which is a 19 years old male developed or starts called two specific antibodies at the day 56 and the antibody response is fairly strong because of this the presence of this source co2 specific antibody this is a strong indication that this subject contracted the virus at some point however through this entire enrollment uh in the study from this subject he never reported any symptoms nor did he have any positive pcr tests no that is not only single cross pcr tests but it's a series of uh physical tests that never that is never positive and by applying our splicing based logistic regression model we can actually capture that at day 42 the probability of infection is really high and uh the time frame between this infection to antibody development is important it again roughly corresponds to our understanding of antibody generation after the infection so this really indicates that the spicing biomarkers are very robust in terms of capturing those pcr cost negatives so we're really encouraged by this so work we work with a florida company to implement a subset of those splashing biomarkers microfloating devices and then evaluated in know third you know second independent cohort and just through this simple analysis of pca we will almost we can almost perfectly separate the copy 19 patients from the mapping subjects um so this really demonstrates that uh our splicing markers now are very accurate and also robust across different platforms because we develop those biomarkers from our ac and now they're included as probes microfluidic devices this is part of a bigger project that is funded by the department of defense that towards developing deployable devices for fast and accurate diagnostics and now we are very excited about those results and uh actually actively exploring this in a combination of gene expression dna methylation in a small portable device that can be developed deployed train station uh airports for fast and accurate detection for a range of pathogens so hopefully at this point i've shown you that splicing is really a challenge of not only just a robust biomarkers for diagnostics but also they're functionally important fiber compared to gene expression the study of spicing is still somewhat understudied and this is for good reason so using rna-seq the statistical power for differential gene expression column during accentuates at 25 million arrears versus for supply chain in this general biology paper three years ago the authors compared a range of popular tools out there for analyzing splicing and the event 120 million rays we still don't see a clear saturation for produce the cisco power so the over-reliance of splicing analysis on the sequencing depth is really a major issue in the field so as an attempt to resolve this issue i've developed this uh deep learning model called darts so darts is a is a framework of two components the first one is calculation hypothesis testing which is an infrared inference module and the second module is a deep neural network that is the predictive module so in a grim box we can use the basic inference with a flat plier to compile a list of high confidence differential and unchanged axons these axons will then be trained in a neural network based off their local sequences regulatory elements and also a set of transacting elements such as rbps that capture the cellular contacts so during application this trend dartsdnn model will be used to generate a prediction for each axon of totally independent data sets and then these predictions will be used as an informative prior back to this uh patient reference in order to augment any application of interest so the key for darts to success apparently is to the generation of this accurate informative prior so to do that we trend darts on big data in the public domain including all the shrea knockouts in encode and tissue specific splicing profiles in roadmap so by training darts on the combination of those two consortium this data which has more than 5 million differential splashing events the dots generates pretty well across different cellular contexts and on different perturbation of iron binding proteins so just as a demonstration of how darks can be used in practice here we leverage the fact that encode has 28 control samples of k562 and 24 samples of our high b2 we can pull those uh replica kits to form this ultra deep rs6 resource in order to perform this cell type specific alternative splicing analysis so this is our gold standard then we can move on to perform an exhaustive pairwise comparison this is 28 by 24 individual replicate analysis by using the dataset specific features so the idea here is really just using this low shallower sequencing depth in individual replicas and see how they can recuperate what's happening when you put them all together and for each of these pairwise comparisons we can run both the inference module with a flat prior and with a general deep learning generating deformative prior and we see that incorporating the informative prior always improves the performance for this influence model in terms of recapitulating uh what's in the ultra deep rnz resource and more interestingly the best gun actually comes from the lowest sequencing coverage so for example here if the pool if you are putting two replicas that in some only have about 50 million risk then incorporating this informative prior will give your eight percent getting a upr versus if you already have 220 million risk then probably nothing can be improved anymore and this is uh at least in part resolve the over-reliance of splicing analysis on the rnc coverage that is through the generation and incorporation of informative prior in this deployment and visual analysis so this is all very good but i also want to underline the importance of neural network architectures so neural architectures refers to a wide range of copper parameters that exist in neural networks for example how many layers you have for for the neural network within each layer how many neurons and for each neuron what kind of computational operation you want to impose on it et cetera et cetera so here just as an example the red line is the dars model that are trend and then compared to the blue line which is a much shallower architecture we can see that this shallow architecture is just not capable of generalized very well across different cellular contacts and the performance essentially saturates very early on um and this architectural tuning is important yet is very laborious and becomes exponentially harder for conventional neural networks because um simply because the cnns will have a much much more hyper parameters to tune so to resolve this this move gets us to our second topic of survey which is automatically declining to design the neural architectures so i implemented this uh automated machinery method you know called the name called amber or automated modeling for biological evidence-based research but why do we really want to do that i think that benefits comes in two-fold uh so for for for people who are generating the data and who might not be so familiar with deep learning i think canberra can significantly eliminate the the the burden of a developing and deploying model by automating this process and even for experts who was trained and works on machine learning amber can help can help them to explore a much larger space of possible models you know very quickly and in a purely data driven way in particular the process of amber works like this so we can first initially the controller network which is the master that generates uh at generating neural architectures is totally on trend and then we can sample some network architectures from the controller network in the model space and get the validation loss orbitalization accuracy from an independent dataset and then this validation accuracy will be fitted as a reward signal to this controller network so that we can train this controller network to generate better and better neural architectures over time so this process is iterated uh it's done iteratively so that this in this reinforcement learning setup so that the controller network will be able to generate better and better architectures over time um so the algorithms implemented in amber is efficient and purely data-driven and now as i was just showing you a second it is capable of searching over 10 to the power of 30 viable architectures in less than 72 gpu hours so yeah i skipped a few like mathematical details here um if you are interested and we have time we can go talk about that later but uh for now we can apply this model on classical epigenetics marker prediction task which is given a 1000 base per dna sequence want to present the absence of presence of around 900 epigenetic markers this is also known as the deepsea task so before the search we can randomly sample architectures from this large model space and here different computation operations are colored by different colors we can see because this uniform is sampling there's a combination of different colors and aside from the computational operations we also learn those residual connections which has been considered as a key to training deeper and more performant neural neural networks in the modern deep learning so after training the controller network what we got is this new model called ever sig so compared to amber base emperor sig really only likes to use three different competitions which is the pink red and green and this re has a surprising resemblance to the choices of computational operations that is selected in deep sea the human expert model so they just tends to use the same computation operations but comparing those number of parameters we are only using one quarter of the total parameters in the expert model but comparing the performance we're actually doing much better than the both the randomly wired model and this expert model so you can you might think that three percent of eoprc per improvement is not that much but remember this is the average aop rc across 900 individual tasks so a uniform three percent improvement across 900 tasks is actually highly non-trivial so here in this case we can show that this automated model is actually against its uh is the human expert model so in our paper we did a lot of the benchmark about how this automated amber sig model can be used for in different use cases such as wire defect prediction and uh ngos heritability analysis but here just as an example i want to show this particular smp that alters the binding of a transcription factor called spi-1 so the prediction so here we we include both ambersig amber based deepsea the three models we just talked about and also another three popular methods for scoring variety effects delta svm defined and jasper the motif scoring method so for this uh variety fact different methods tends to give a very different prediction with only amber c and deepsea predicts that the gleo will increase the binding compared to allele for this spi-14 factor versus all the other methods predicts the binding in the other direction so from independent chipset data set we know that the g allele is predominantly bond over a leo so in this case amber c can deep c are the winners with amber sig having a much larger magnitude of a prediction compared to deepsea this demonstrates how this automatically generated the model can be used for in violent effect prediction and file mapping in real world cases so amber is a as a free market publicly available and um i'm actively developing and maintaining it in different methodology and application directions and i would really encourage everyone here who's interested to check it out and hopefully can convert your own biochemical experiments into a quantitative deep learning model and even better can use it to interpret how genetic vibrations will alter the molecular phenotypes to follow up on this amber as a platform i will show you that amber is actually a reusable pipeline across biological domains so what i just told you is this um epigenetic regulatory marker prediction the deepsea task we can simply adapt this to the crispr cosmetic editing outcome prediction so the underlying biology for those two are vastly different but from a machine learning perspective they're highly similar and amber will serve as this reusable pipeline that can be generated across different biological domains so this brings the last component of this talk which is uh um automated and vital where predictor for customer edition outcomes i hope you are not so tired because this is very exciting um so a bit of background i hope you all know that cosmetic is a transformative about biotechnology that is capable of adding the genomes so through this programmable guide rna constant can be directed to anywhere almost anywhere in the genome through this targeted sequence and introduce the double strand break at the target site but until recently people start to realize that the repair profile for this castle induced a double strand break is actually reproducible and predictable from the local sequence context so what i mean by uh editing outcomes is uh for example this is your target genomic sequence if you introduce a cut here you will get this one base per insertion around sixty percent of the time and if you do these expense experiments multiple times you will always get this sixty percent of one base per insertion and this is dependent on your local sequence contacts and apparently we're not the first one to use on machine learning to tackle this uh problem there exists at least three methods that aims to predict the antenna outcomes they use boosting machines uh multivirus large distributions and artificial neural networks to uh to to predict these outcomes and a common characteristic of all those three models is that they they depend on feature engineering to derive informative features from those raw genomic sequences and then they need to tune their models hyper parameters before the model can be deployed so we reason that with convolutional neural networks we can totally bypass this feature engineer stuff because cnns can learn uh useful features directly from the raw input and we further couple that with neural texture search implemented in amber and we can also bypass this model engineering thus creating this end-to-end framework for quantum for for cosine editing outcome predictions and that's what we did we created this uh proton predictor group which is a fully automated state-of-the-art prediction for constant energy outcomes so chronicle is trend of synthetic sequences a large volume of synthetic sequences and then tested on endogenous genomic sequences in human t cells so compare those performance on the t cell editing outcome predictions with the existing methods we see that quantum was able to substantially outperform the ones that is designed by human experts and sometimes the accuracy is more than 20 so now we have this uh state-of-the-art highly accurate predictor for crispr castle we want to see how inheritable genetic evaluations will alter the additive outcomes so the reasoning behind this is really because the additive outcomes are dependent on the local sequence contacts then any genetic vibrations that will alter the sequence context is expected to alter the ethical outcomes as well so as a particular example i will show you this pair of uh snip and the panorama 147 which is a target sign for class 9 with this important gene after your iphone 3. so if you have the reference 30 or key this this target is actually not bad at all it has a predicted of over eighty percent knockout rate uh by introducing its friendships however if you have the alternative of a new operator then this will significantly drag down your refrigerator by 2120 i guess more importantly um this this deal is highly frequent in the african population with over around with around 30 percent of our minor neural frequency you know african population so this really means that for any editing primary cells for patients or subjects coming from this african population this target style is probably not a good idea and to do this uniform we can also do this uniformly across the genome and that's why that's how we created the quantum db which hosts the uh for all over five million dynamic targets and uh around 100 million estimated violent facts for um foreign outcome predictions so finally just to print this a little bit in a more clinical relevant setting uh we can extract this particular gene in our quantum db called pdcb1 so pdcdwi is an immune blockage and that is being currently knocked out in an ongoing clinical trial to treat non-small cell cancer patients so here we plot all possible guidelines of constant targets across the stream where each column is a pamphlet and each dot is a genetic variation that can potentially alter the outcomes for this pencil so although there is a numerous potential targets for for to not count this gene uh after considering the present the existence of genetic vibrations we can see it introduces a substantial amount of vibrations and in particular i want to draw your attention to those two guidelines uh the orange boxes so those two guidelines the ones used in this clinical trial and we see that at least for one of them there exists a virus that can significantly alter the additional outcomes and we argue that in order to design more applicable gene therapies induced by crispr carcinoid we should consider the existence of such vibrations and find more vibrant resilient campsites to wrap this up i have told you how we performed the analysis on starscope 2 infection which is on the sex difference story and how splashing biomarkers can be used for accurate diagnostics or a small device you know in the second part i told you this automatic deployment method implemented and applied the tool uh to build models for epigenetics and also for crispr custom outcomes uh for the constant energy outcomes it actually has a strong clinical implications now i'll move forward to the outcomes and future directions so um i think my current and past research has really started to dip into a fourth doctor from biomedicine we have these deep learning models that can interpret this uh non-coding virus effects on genetic vibrations and more importantly we have the capability of additional genomic vibrations um those deep learning models has also been applied to study understand complex molecular effects on both chromatin and rna molecules including gene regulation of a transcriptional and post-functional regulation and those molecular phenotypes can be used as biomarkers to enable like portable device and personalized medicines with therapeutic potentials so building on top of all those research um i'm interested in overall like the overarching goal of my research is to bring this unbiased and data-driven quantitative discoveries to the full stack of biomedicine and in particular of our time the three specific outcomes that i'm interested in exploring the immediate future the first one is a developing auto about framework for interpretable biology and depart deep learning uh so i guess interpretability is very important for building human trustworthy deep different models especially in the context of biomedicine but i believe i'm uniquely positioned to bring a different perspective to this question by engineering or one or more of the components under this ultimate automotive platform so that we can strike the balance between predictive for and also biologically interpretable models this can also be generalized to multi-modal data integrations such as language models and image analysis and on the molecular side i propose to extend my current research on crispr gene editing by by a more complete spectrum of predicted editing outcomes and also systematically analyze the viral defects personalized variant facts and uh especially in the context of a risk predisposing virus also current crispr caustic research has really focused on the coding sequences by simply introducing the stream shift to the coding sequences and we know that the vast majority of those human genome is non-coding and with a lot of regulatory elements i want to extend the crispr concentration to coupled with those molecular traits as well so finally this is inspired by the study of starscope 2 and how excel exceptionally well this splicing biomarkers are i want to systematically study how splicing as a post-transitional signature can cross talk with the gene expression and perhaps other poster transcriptional effects on the rna molecules and in the broad context of infectious diseases including bacterial and virus infections and uh with that i want to thank my postdoc inviter olga and other choice gaia group members um my collaborator at mount sinai uh that helped to collect it and analyze the charm cohort data sets and my phd phd lab and collaborators at the children's hospital of philadelphia and ucla the funding for my postdoc research comes from the science foundation and i want to thank you for your listening and i'm happy to take any questions thank you frank that's a very exciting and clearly presented talk now we have time for questions anyone wants to start you can mute yourself or you can type in your questions in terms of in terms of predicting the cas9 crispr sites do you find that there's variation from cell type or cell line to cell line do you find that there's more variation across ancestries is there any variation across that in in this data that you can see right now we don't see such a strong differences this is mainly because the dna repair system or pathway is highly stabilized across different tissues and cell types but maybe the only exception is on in stem cells i think the repair system is just more efficient in stem cells but um for example just to be more specific we train our model on synthetic sequences in k562 and then apply them in a primary human t cells and they just work like extremely well so i think for at least from what we see right now um a lot of tissue specificity is not very strong in the for the cosmetic prediction but i would speculate that will be different for the stem cells and um yeah with like a different repair uh with different repair pathways and activities and actually um i have a collaborator on christopher costner who is really a pioneer in this field they developed this the repair sig uh i think they posted in bauer archive but basically they can interrogate the repair outcomes when you knock out certain repair enzymes and uh if you have a preservation of those dna repair enzymes or pathways that can really change the energy outcomes but given the stability across different cell lines i think so far we haven't spotted any strong signals from there hi frank that was a really great talk um i was curious can you talk a little bit more about how the parameter search actually works you said something about it being reinforcement learning a little more detail and also i'm curious uh how it relates to bayesian optimization is it similar or completely different so right now it's a it's not very it's not different but there are some recent work that have other brand this tool works together but i guess i can quickly show you some intuitions behind it just let me find my backup site yeah so you know supervised machine learning usually we just try to learn this uh approximate function that with parameters omega but here we have some other hyper parameters called uh a or architecture so the architecture and the omega is really this nasty optimization right so you determine this architecture first and then those omegas like within this architecture the parameters are trained by gradients and then this architecture can be further breakdown in the case of uh neural networks is the layer by layer basis right so you have uh you can sample each layer as a token from a zero one tools sequentially this the the auto regressive nature for this is really important to consider and here we are really just interested in learning this conditional probability right so for example condition on the fact that the previous two layers are convolution layers what's the probability of the third layer in order to generate a high performance architecture so we can do that through this introduction of a recurrent neural network that predicts this conditional probability and how do we optimize this uh this setup this is where the reinforcement learning comes into play where we can optimize data with respect to a reward on the validation accuracy and this is just like policy ingredient by multiplying the log likelihood of generating a particular architecture with their reward so the total combined objective is that we want to find a high reward with a large likelihood and uh yeah this is uh this is how it works in a nutshell does that make sense yeah this is this is really helpful so um at a high level maybe the intermission is that you can cut down on the exponential search base by looking at correlations between uh layers that work together to give the best performance yeah exactly exactly and that's where like this is different from foundation optimization because i don't think the naive visual optimization is just tricking different tokens separately um however the recent development reveals that you can actually encode this uh neural architecture through some like for example you can code it with a graphical neural network so then this will be um encoded in a latent space uh and then that that latent space can be optimized by patient optimism optimization fairly efficiently and actually actually i think the method is called bananas and it's uh it's kind of state of the art great power right yeah i guess i can extend uh briefly about this so the benefit of the bonus from understanding the math is from so the previous setup is really the basics uh but uh if we understand this we can further incorporate some of the biology descriptors for a0 right so the vanilla form 0 is the marginal probability it doesn't condition or anything but we can condition on all some biology called descriptors so that we can study the interaction of a biology within neural architectures for example like chipset datasets tends to use this architecture and the versus uh dnas will use the other one and now aside from this simple tokens we can also learn more complex structures such as residual connections and we are actively exploring more like this uh biophysics the king outman diagrams type of stuff so those are engineered from this existing mathematical framework yeah uh can you hear me yeah i'm going to get back to what maybe also have been liz's question can you go back to show the crispr that was used in humans where you had the good and the bad performing ones because if i understand this correctly there are potentially variants in the neighborhood of where you're doing the crispering now the diagram where you said there's one in clinical trial that's currently being used was it crystal or was it anti-sense uh i thought it was crispr yeah so i think what liz liz was asking and if not i'm asking now is are the ones that are bad performing or predicting to be bad performing due to variants nearby that are not known are they more likely to be from uh genomes that are of non-caucasian races so that we select when we make these uh clinical trials genomes that are mostly caucasian but we may get into have a higher likelihood of getting into troubles like in your example when we are applying it to non-caucasian samples yeah that's exactly what i'm trying to do yes um right so because the reference genome is uh supposedly derived from european ancestry and i think there is a lot of other examples just like this and i think for a clinical trial to be successful and uh widely applicable uh as a gene therapy it should be we should be able to find those uh target sides that are resilient across population and uh does not introduce other issues yeah yup frank thanks thanks a lot for the talk we enjoyed it and it really corresponds to our earlier conversations and it's really a good basis for further discussions i was fascinated by the sex different stuff in the beginning between males and females and stars ii infection and i was just fascinated by the fact that the males are suffering more but when you looked at the um symptomology and broke that down you know the females were really showing off more symptoms and more categories than the males and it was just driving me crazy to figure out what was going on there i mean is and i saw that first line was symptomatic and i was just wondering if you've derived any insights in terms of what's going on there i mean it's almost as if you know it's a silent killer i mean you know it's the males are dying are suffering more but the females are showing more symptoms and i just couldn't put my head around it yeah yeah that's not that's definitely about it concerning that i think it's due to the unique things of our cohort so because they're all like marine recruits they are physically really they're physically fit and um as you can see like over 50 of them are asymptomatic and uh none of them need any of us possible hospitalization or anything severe like this purely very mild symptoms about kobe if they have any and uh on the other note is i think this has very interesting things to the vaccine side effects so we know from viral sources that taking the mri vaccines females are more likely to experience side effects such such as uh like a range of different side effects i think this is yourself and from the media cause of mediation analysis that we performed i think this can really be linked to the underlying immune systems and interferons um this is an indication that females have are have a very strong and active immune response uh that is actually working and when you're when someone's immune system is working you will inevitably have some symptoms such as fever and i think we have some wild speculations on this as well i think this might be linked to the evolution of uh why females have a stronger immune system to start with but uh yeah as far as what our data suggests i think that's the explanation thank you it's fascinating yeah frank won't you ask about the automated system the amber how much tuning is needed when you port it to different systems i guess if the input data has a lot of say cell type stratification you just name the stratifier then you can walk away it will do the job is that right yeah i think it's a fairly automated uh process i think it's uh um the worst case you can just specify a large enough model space and then around uh to explore the best like optimal architecture from this large model space and given the efficiency of this search you can write multiple times and uh and see the virus between the performance say if the input data is not a linear sequence but a like high c it's a graph or 2d image would you need to touch the architecture dramatically i would think that you need to compile the data maybe a little bit efforts on that part can you hear me yeah yeah because i think my internet just blinked a little bit but uh yeah what i'm saying is uh perhaps most efforts will be compiling the data in a way that's machine uh readable and friendly um yeah but the underlying machine learning framework will be fairly um similar if you are trying to turn on convolution in your landscape and uh i mean if you want to train a graphic on your network in the case of pi c uh i think that's that's not something we can do right now but we're definitely very interested in exploring how graph neural networks can be searched yeah okay we're at the end of the hour anyone wants to ask the last question okay it's not well frank thank you again yeah a wonderful talk all right thank you for hosting this and i really enjoyed it um talking with everyone yeah great okay bye bye and everyone take care bye i
