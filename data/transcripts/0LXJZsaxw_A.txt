all right we've got a few people I hate this time you know and I got the I got the seminar flyer and I looked at it and I'm like who wrote this title because of my you know any students that I've had in my lab I would never let them have this kind of title or I would never advise this kind of title and then I I realized no how did that happen and I realized oh yeah this was the other night when I realized that this was due like a week ago and then I forgot about it and then at like whatever late at night I was doing this and then I started looking at the abstract and realized oh that was a mess too with all kinds of typos and all of that so so this was actually a great opportunity for me though to remember something and I've got a lot of Mind hacks that I like to use but one of them is this and I thought I'd share it with you guys which is a mistake is not something which is wrong but it's an opportunity and so this particular mistake you know of like not really paying attention when I was writing a title and making it three lines long which is like even too long for a paper right well it was a great opportunity because it got me to give myself a chance to revise that title so I'm going to revise that title and show you the revised title which looks something like this which um I was going to come up with a second phrase but then I thought maybe pictures are better actually so to word real time personalized medicine that is what we'll be talking about and using wearable sensors that's totally what we'll be talking about um but then I have these two images here and it gives me a chance to actually share with you what these mean to me and I'm going to spend fair amount talk of time well a fair amount not don't worry it won't be the whole hour but a bit of time talking about this curve this s-shaped sigmoid curve and then so that's at one end and at the other end I have this picture here ultimately to represent health and so as you know was mentioned I'm a medical oncologist and I definitely see patients who have you know very Advanced disease But ultimately what we're trying to do right is is to is to reach something called health and there's many ways to Define it but I feel like this picture defines it pretty well in terms of you know the feeling and the the imagery actually that you get with this so anyways that's what I'll talk about today so I don't have any conflicts to disclose uh related to this talk and I'll give you a quick outline right background I'll spend some time just telling you a little bit more about the background about the inspiration the motivation for like why why I'm very passionate about wearable sensors and and where this field can go and then I'll talk a bit about a very focused study about temperature data and using that as a biomarker and in fact you know this was a very very close collaboration with with two other groups one is sung Choice group she's a pediatric oncologist and the other is Danny forger's group and so Danny I'm so happy that you know Danny actually is here because there may be some questions that that come up that Danny might also be able to answer that are you know more on the mathematical side and they look also from his team wonderful and so I'll talk about that and then just I'll take just a minute basically to just talk about some future directions you know from my perspective so let's start with background and you know I mentioned that s shape curve and I have to say I totally geek out on that curve and even I was telling my wife the other day I'm like I'm totally gonna geek out on this because I geek out on it every time because I have been just like I don't know like just captured by this since when I was in undergrad and I took my first biochemistry class and I saw this and you know this is the hemoglobin dissociation curve I think related to what the concentration of oxygen is and at low concentrations of oxygen you know hemoglobin sticks tightly and then you know at higher concentration that doesn't stick as tightly and I thought this was interesting and it's the first time I'd actually even heard the probably heard the word sigmoid I don't even know what it meant and I kept talking about the sigmoid curve and then over the years right going through grad school doing all the you know molecular Biola cell and molecular biology courses going through medical school you know doing all the human physiology and all of that I found that this curve pops up everywhere right so um you can see here here's the DNA melting curve right if you have two strands of DNA you heat them and you know what percentage of the DNA is going to be on un annealed versus annealed very similar here's the influenza spread curve I'm sure the covid spread curve is very similar here's a bacterial growth curve and here's even a curve from social psychology on the transmission of behaviors how behaviors spread you know within a community and to me this was actually has been very fascinating since I was a postdoc because as a postdoc I started out in a lab that was doing functional genomics and by the time five years later you know we we finished it was I finished I mean just the words had changed but it was really into systems biology and in my last year or two as a postdoc I sort of felt like a lot of the functional genomics we were doing were systems biology as we called it it wasn't really it wasn't what I had what I had promised or you know what I had envisioned which is I thought that um you know if we could just get enough data and we could just measure every parameter in a cell or even in a in a system you know like that we would be able to eventually like you know do some calculations and and and basically predict everything that's going to happen and boy was I in for a rude surprise that was my first one of many many you know episodes of naivete I would say in my life and but one of the things that was great about it is that it got me to kind of dig into that so I started like asking the question of like how much do we know and how much can we know and and what is modeling all about and and I never became a modeler so I'm not a card-carrying you know modeler by any means but I went and had conversations I took some courses and did all of that and one of the things that came out of that though was trying to understand um and it wasn't just from modeling but but from like going into complex systems science you know a bit was trying to understand why these s-shaped curves exist like what's the underlying basis of that and it really turns out as far as I can tell and you know you know maybe there could be other views on this but in my view most of these sigmoidal curves most the time they're the result of allosteri and Alistair is kind of a jargon term for me and from biochemistry um but I think basically what it means is anytime you have a network of connected things if what's happening on for example the classic examples in a protein molecule if what's happening over here can influence what's happening over here or if it's over time steps what happened before it influences what's next you get this non-linear behavior and ultimately you can get sometimes you can get these sigmoidal curves and so that was really you know interesting to me and then the other interesting thing of course is that this sigmatal curve in the middle there right in biology really describes State transitions so you know like for example here in the DNA melting curve it goes from two strands bound together to two strands you know floating apart from bacterial growth you know you could kind of look at it as from a very like non-communal state of bacteria you know and then they grow and then now you've got this like very dense Community you know similar sort of yeah interpretations exist you know for all these curves and so after kind of going through a medical school and then residency and clinical Fellowship training from my perspective these State transitions seem to be like so relevant for medicine because we don't talk about it I'll tell you in medicine I'll give you like you know the medicine window hopefully a little bit um people don't talk about State transitions but this is exactly what's happening right they're transitioning from a healthy state to a disease State this as a very very you know gross simplification but then the question is like how does that all happen and you know everything I'm actually going to say here today almost everything except the part that Danny's lab worked on is actually really super simple there's nothing like really complex about it in a way um or or abstruse about it but it's just that for me personally I just you know get very um what I don't even know what the right word is but like I keep asking myself how come we're still practicing medicine without these ideas they're simple ideas but actually coming into the the healthcare field coming into the medical field and so one of the things you know that's related to this again comes back to this s-shaped curve and I'm going to show you this plot and actually um uh this is a kind of a perspective piece that that song Choi um and uh what Johnson Tyler was a postdoc in Danny's um lab we wrote together and it really does talk about this this basically the same s-shaped curve and the idea here is that if you just again abstract out a little bit about disease time is on this axis on the x-axis on the y-axis is is basically you know what's the evidence of that disease it could be a biomarker that you're measuring or could be symptoms it could be you know whatever you define right as the definition of a disease State and the thing is that um from this model and I think there's quite a bit of data actually from real disease that would support at least that this is a very common model and again this is how complex living systems seem to work at least from from my perspective so this is our working model you know there's this pre-disease state that lasts for a while and then you have over here this disease State and then in between something happens and the early pre-disease state is ideally it'd be great if you'd know what's going to happen back here but as you can see the signal is pretty low so signal to noise is low then over here on the far right is the disease State here the signal with noise you know actually is quite good compared to Baseline right but the problem is this out here is typically when you have symptoms you know and so by this time you know a person can be actually pretty sick and I started out like thinking about this when we were doing those circulating nucleic acid biomarkers because we're really interested in early cancer detection and this was the problem that we ran into is well by the time there's an established cancer and there's enough DNA or other biomarkers released into the bloodstream it's all very established but when you start really early out there's just traces of those and they're really hard to find and so the trick is actually that there's this window right that's the transition state that's the actual evolution of the disease process and how can we get a window into that um you know has been really the the question because this is the place where you have a chance I think a fighting chance so to speak of actually detecting something that's happening and then um but also detecting it early enough right where where an intervention could actually reverse the process so again none of this is again like you know super high intellectually um but I think it's important and and the thing is and again I'm going to talk to you now again with the medical lens the healthcare lens kind of having one foot you know in that in that world this to me is is like the elephant right the elephant in the room as they say everyone always ignore me and and I don't mean to um have any disrespect to actually a lot of people who are not ignoring this at least in the research world there's a lot of people who are very passionate right about early prediction and and prevention and intervention and all of that when I say this I just mean that that's not in my view the predominant state of health care and so this first part again was more about inspiration and motivation and I'll tell you um here's a book that I I studied this version of a version of this book like 20 years ago now this is basically an internal medicine manual and the title I noticed has not changed you know and this was like around the year to probably 1999 I was studying for my boards or whatever right um it was still called current medical diagnosis and treatment and today it's still called current medical diagnosis and treatment it's just the year has changed right and the thing is you know this medicine is about this it's over here right current medical diagnosis and treatment and so you know the future would be Universal prediction and prevention right I mean that's that's anyways I mean I I know I spent you know quite a bit of your time uh talking about this but I I I just felt it was important that that that's to me the the motivation for a lot of what goes on in this field and again there are lots of people that are interested in this uh it's not and actually I'm very excited that there's more and more people interested in this in basically moving from a reactive system for healthcare which is mostly different by symptoms I mean yes we have screenings for certain Cancers and some of that but it's still like it's still a tip of the iceberg I believe of what's possible but this this shift um I think is is is you know that's what's inspiring to me and so I hope that one day this title of this book will be changed from current medical diagnosis and treatment the current medical prediction prevention and diagnosis and treatment I don't know what year that will be but I actually hope that some of you guys that are working in this room right now will you know will be the ones to help contribute to that um okay I mean any questions actually just about that background stuff I'll just pause for a for a minute yeah can you hear me Manish yes thank you I love that you know I've been thinking the same thing about this transition point in the case of depression with treatment resistant depression there was a talk that was given a uh for the Eisenberg uh award for depression at the kickoff for the the renaming of the depression Center you know and it looks like when one hits treatment resistance and depression which means that you had multiple failures of drugs you're asking the state where the brain is like broken in some ways and the drugs can't affect the brain they would a normal brain yeah so actually when they intervene and get the person out of major depression depression through implantable you know stimulation or cranial or ketamine or psilocybins then the brain starts is available to heal again so there's this area where there's this you know you have that red line line it's like non-linear but then it's highly non-linear then it's kind of non-linear but kind of behaved a little bit and I think in that zone if we could model that we might really do ourselves a favor in terms of our understanding of you know the onset of disease and I really appreciate you to just talk I won't take up any more of your time oh thank you Brian I I wasn't aware that you know there's a similar thing going on in Psychiatry though I'm not surprised you know because because I said in the beginning it's like I've actually challenged people to find me a a place in biology where there isn't some of this you know going on and I have yet to see anyone who's who's found that you know that where where the curve is really not linear uh sorry is really linear and not and not uh sigmoidal in at least in some component of it so uh and you know we run into the same thing in oncology Brian which is that once tumors are established it's almost like you know you you know you know this concept of course right I mean of like a tractor States and it's almost like once you land in that attractor State exactly that place and now to pop it out you have to do something really intense right like exactly and you know diabetes uh to you know metabolics and the whole metabolic syndrome thing and progression pre-diabetes stuff it's a strange attractor and then to be able to get out of that and that's exactly how they modeled the treatment resistance and the talk that Helen neighbor gave for uh they knew had a picture of the attractor and she was working with physicists yeah same thing that's super interesting and again like for as motivation if it is for anyone you know in this room in general who's interested in this field I mean that's the whole idea right is if if through the work that you do we can do this kind of prediction like it doesn't have to get to where a disease has become a whole you know new attractor State and now you've got to take like you know massive essentially interventions with lots of side effects right to actually pop it out of there so um I'm going to sort of switch over a little bit now and talk to oh yeah sure no please yeah do they cover like a standard format oh this particular book you're talking about areas of medicine or did they vary with with each issue oh no this is uh it's it's internal medicine so there's a scope that's covered in Internal Medicine which is pretty broad so it's essentially the same topics every year and you know to be fair snapshot pardon me it's sort of like a snapshot yeah sort of snapshot exactly of like dying diabetes what's the current diagnosis and treatment and you know on in whatever lung cancer what's the current diagnosis and treatment with Nephrology you know the whole the whole thing the things that aren't covered are like you know surgery obstetrics Psychiatry those things are not covered as much yeah okay thank you yeah and to be fair there is a prevention chapter in there but you know it's like one out of you know very small fraction and it's not again it's no knock on the people writing these books it's just that's that's kind of where we're at right now and and so you know as I mentioned earlier I worked on the circulating nucleic acids and one of the reasons to work on these new circling nucleic acids was I felt like okay we can get blood samples and we could get them over time and maybe we can get information right on this kind of Dynamics and so we started doing that but then you know that has its own inherent limitations in terms of at least time you can get a whole different kind of information right with sequencing and and you know all kinds of proteomics and metabolomics that's what we're doing in our multi-ohmic study of cytokine release syndrome but getting really fine time resolution is one of the limitations and so we still continue to work on this and one of the things we've been working on is is trying to get these biomarkers instead of out of the blood out of the urine because a lot of markers that are in the blood actually get into the urine um and so that's that's another project you know that that we're working on because that would allow us to get again more more time resolution but what was really exciting to me probably about it's probably about 10 years ago you know was of course all of these wearable technologies that started coming out um and this is when I was at Fred Hutch and and um and moving here part of the actual motivation of to move here was to be so see Fred Hutch is a dedicated cancer center it's not a university I was affiliated with the University of Washington but it's different when you have dcmb and the hospital you know and the math department you know and the engineering school and the sociology school and everybody Under One Roof you know all under one president it's it's different you know in terms of I'd say the the culture the environment and when what you can get done and that was one of the reasons to to move here and so what became really exciting of course was this idea of digital biomarkers right so you could get data of course you'd get different kinds of data we can't get necessarily you know gene expression data or single cell genomics data on this time scale but we can get um you know some data you know that that's more like a composite it's sort of a difference in scale right like we've again we do work that's at the molecular and cellular scale but now with these wearable devices you're kind of getting at a higher level of scale I don't want to say it's the whole system but it's sort of looking at the whole system and and looking at sort of Windows into it and as you might be aware I mean there's all kinds of devices um at least consumer grade there's a lot of devices now there's also medical grade devices that are coming out and even like this was before the pandemic like three four years ago I went to a wearable devices uh Summit and um I was amazed by companies like Bosch you know I thought they just made dishwashers but they have a whole r d section devoted to Smart textiles so they're looking into the future about like clothing and getting wearables implanted in there so so I think that you know there's lots of opportunities that are going to be there that are already there in terms of be able to capture this kind of data and so you know what we've again been excited about is the idea that this call this can provide this sort of personalized medicine in a different way which in a different way than like I said the other projects that we do right that might be for example related to multi-omics in this case the personalization is based upon you know getting this physiological data of what's Happening um to the body over time and because they're wearable sensors and wirelessly connected it can be real time and then of course you know the real exciting part would be the predictive modeling piece and so um I'll sort of transition there so this is what got us into these wearable devices and now what I'm going to do is talk to you about like one case study essentially there's different ways to look at it right like one question we asked one case study one like narrowed down here's a project right um and in this particular case there's as you probably as you know I mean with wearables there's so many different threads of data you can get you can get heart rate like even with this Fitbit that I'm wearing you at heart rate accelerometry sleep you know all this kind of stuff um but the one that and and you know with our collaborators we're looking at those other data types as well but one of the data types that has been uh probably less available from the consumer wearables although it's changing now is temperature and in this case I mean body temperature and um so we got interested in looking at you know what are the Dynamics of body temperature and what can they tell us about disease especially hopefully in this pre-diagnosis state and temperature as you may already know it's very fundamental like we just look in the universe right it's a fundamental property of the universe and it's also a fundamental influence on living systems so over here on the left side here is from you know from my physical chemistry undergrad class you know the Gibbs free energy equation and temperature is there there's a lot of other terms that are not there you know that we study but temperature is there and then over here are enzyme kinetics and activation energies right or even chemical reaction kinetics right and how temperature influences all of that right so so that was one of the motivations to to actually you know look into temperature the other interesting thing about temperature from a human physiology standpoint is it's so tied to the immune system and inflammation and infection and this is kind of again kind of busy diagram here but what I'm the reason I put it up here is to kind of illustrate that what's actually happening with your body temperature it's normally very very tightly regulated right um but and the there's a whole system essentially and there's a system that that takes inputs and obviously there's system that takes us outputs like the sweat glands and your mobility and all of that to maintain this temperature and tight regulation but what's interesting then is that actually when your temperature goes out of Regulation it's usually a big deal now from a hospital standpoint okay maybe it's not a big deal you ask a lot of doctors and they'll say oh fewer temperatures 99.9 oh you're fine right I mean this is normal and it's okay it's okay because again I have to put like different hats on right so sometimes when I put the hats or the doctor glasses you know I would say like my parents will call my temperature is 99.9 don't worry it's fine it's fine right because I don't want them to be stressed or whatever and we'll watch and nothing we can do but then if you put this other hat on of physiology and and research and science you say well 99.9 that's probably not really normal you know it may not be disease yet but there's there's something that could be off depending on what all else is going on and so the what what I what sort of Illustrated here is that anytime there's infection or inflammation or certain certain types of inflammation they activate the innate immune system and it actually these cells in the innate immune system secrete these cytokines these proteins that go through the blood and they are called pyrogenic cytokines they're because they cause fever and these cytokines then actually end up in the brain and end up in the blood vessels to the hypothalamus and the endothelial cells they have effects there and all of this stuff right is happening and then that actually triggers the hypothalamus to decide where your temperature set point is and whether you should have fever or not so it's this like very sophisticated very sophisticated process right to regulate this Global parameter of temperature and so you know the way we're thinking about it is wow like you know like people are trying to come up with biomarkers or we're trying to make machines to figure out what's going on right sensors but the body's already doing it you know it's got this very sophisticated system so if we can just measure some deviations in this you know it's probably going to be meaningful so that that's the that's the backdrop for all of this and then you know as a as a scientist right looking now in patient populations we have to decide where do you start and so if you're gonna usually with with with research at least what I've seen is you try to look for the extremes at least starting out right whether in genetics like when early days of genetics people look for those mendelian traits that were like really highly penetrant you start looking at the extremes and then go from there so for temperature a couple of sort of the extreme cases are are really when you have patients who don't have a strong immune system for fighting infection for example you know or you have other patients who um get you know syndromes where uh where the immune system is just taking off and just exploding and when I say they don't have a strong immune system for for fighting infection that doesn't mean they don't have the immune system for sensing infection so there's two patient populations we decide to study one are the ones that get stem cell transplants and the others are these patients who get this therapy called chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy or car T cell therapy and a lot of lumbo jumbo but the bottom line is these are basically patients that get treatments that we call Cellular therapy because basically you take the cells you take immune cells out of the patients you do something to them and then in one case you do something with the car T Cell Therapy you modify them in the other case you try to treat the patient with a lot of chemotherapy to try to kill their cancer and you infuse them back in but in both of these cases these patients are really susceptible to severe infections I mean to the point where like you know they can die from those infections very quickly in 24 48 Hours um that's the case for the stem cell transplant patients and for these car T Cell Therapy patients they get something called cytokine release syndrome where the immune so because you take their T cells you take their immune cells you expand them and then you just pump them back in and they get into the body and then they take off trying to fight the cancer but sometimes and actually very commonly that whole process really sets off triggers a whole Cascade and and the reason I'm telling you all this is in both of these cases the first signal that there's a serious infection or that this cytokine release syndrome is happening is fever and and so that was a long explanation to give you the background but I you know at least I I hope I hope it's it's helpful to at least get the context of this and so that's why we decided to work actually focus on these two populations of patients because we thought that you know this is a case where if there's going to be a temperature dysregulation it's going to be big and also if we can find a way to pick it up earlier it's going to have a big impact because these are both very serious uh complications that can send patients to the ICU potentially lethal um so I think yeah we talked pretty much about this so and so we had a couple of again these are the two populations and you know our hypotheses you know basically were that um let's see where it's at okay uh harpaxis was basically can we if we were to now get continuous temperature data because these patients are actually in the hospital they check into the hospital they get their treatments they're observed for anywhere from two to four weeks and then they're discharged and during that time all kinds of crazy stuff can happen like these life-threatening you know serious infections or this cytokine release syndrome and so our basic hypothesis was that if you look right now at the standard of care it's nurses coming in taking temperature every four to eight hours that's what's normally done and if we could actually now do a continuous temperature monitoring where we're getting the data in the case of what we did was every two minutes you know could that number one allow us to just pick up fevers sooner and couldn't number two allow for prediction you know of of the of the events even before they happen and I'm going to briefly just talk to you about Beaver so fever has been known for I know at least a thousand years there's historical records or at least of of fever uh or the idea that you know when people get sick their body gets hot I'm sure it's many more than that a thousand years it's probably you know very very back into our history but when it comes to medical sort of definitions of fever the generally accepted medical definition is above 38 degrees Celsius is fever and Below it's no fever and this threshold was actually established like over like you know like over a hundred years ago 150 or whatever years ago and it was actually by this guy who like actually did a clinical study I don't know how he did it but you know I guess research was was a little clinical research was a little faster back then or whatever but he stayed 25 000 patients and then came up with this threshold and it's more or less still used even though we all know that people vary right so even though body temperature is very tightly regulated from person to person where their set point is could be different you know due to thyroid hormone status for example and also throughout the day which we'll talk about shortly you know with circadian variation but in the hospital right now I'll tell you it's just simple 38 degrees that's what it is and there's reasons for that you know and I think one of the reasons is we haven't had this kind of technology so we don't even know if it would make a difference and the other is cognitive overload because there's so many things that Physicians have to like know and make these choices and decisions and and so that's where again a lot of the work at least more broadly right being done in dcmb and these Allied Fields you know towards reducing some of that with decision support Etc I think it's just going to be so important so um as I mentioned hypothesis was that hopefully we can detect these fevers and these events earlier because the fever is essentially the defining signal you know that says there's an infection or there's cytokine release syndrome and hopefully predict it as well and this is just a rough you know overview of the study you know it was it had about 60 odd patients in it you know about you know two-thirds of these 43 were the stem cell transplant patients and about you know 25 were these car T Cell Therapy patients and what we used was uh actually an FDA approved uh dedicated temperature monitoring device it's a little skin patch and it was actually originally developed for babies so that you know parents could just you know put this patch on their little infant and not have to go and disturb the infant because you know never never wake up a sleeping baby just like you know that that's like a rule of of parenting and so um and and so that's how they started but this has been now on the market for some time and it's wirelessly connected you know by Bluetooth and and all of that so we were able to then basically say in the hospital for two to four weeks these patients are coming in they're going to come in and we're going to give them these patches and in this case we actually asked them to self-apply these patches and so that itself is a bit of a challenge because these are sometimes sick patients you know and sometimes they don't feel that well and they don't necessarily want to change the patch because it's it's applied every day um but this is because we're in the research phase you know we couldn't actually have nurses ask nurses to do it because that's for clinical care and this was for research so that was how we went about this and so we gave them these patches ideally trying to go for you know two to four weeks the whole time that they're in the hospital and the reason I'm saying that is to just allude to the fact that of course there's missing data and you know that's that's that's normal um not desirable but normal and so we did that we collected that data but then the beauty of this was the nurses were also collecting the Vital sign data so we went into the EHR and pulled all that data which is shown here in the sort of gold colored you know dots and you can see it was more sparse than the temperature data and then we also went into the EHR and pulled out the diagnoses and who got infection and when and who got cytokine release syndrome and and when during the hospitalization Etc and and here's just some examples of some raw data plots this is a car T patient this is the HCT means metaportic cell transplant or stem cell transplant patient and you can just see here like 38 is in red which is the fever threshold in you know medical clinical fever threshold and you can see all the data points and you can see there's noise there's data that's you know really low here turns out that most of that data is because sometimes the patch will slip down and you know if you don't reposition it it's supposed to go under under the armpit that will happen and other times I don't show it to here but there's this missing data so that's just stuff you know we we have to deal with um and then so one of the things we did was we looked at the overall concordance you know of the of this data to the clinical data by the nurses and long story short is you know it's it's quite well high in terms of concordance it's highly correlated we didn't this is more I think the blend Altman analysis so it's not really correlation but it's it's highly how highly concordant there is a bit of a bias I think because we didn't filter any of this and because these lower data points so on average the data is about half a degree or so lower you know in um in the uh sorry at median 0.5 degrees or 0.4 degrees actually in this case lower in the in the in the continuous monitoring so I'm going to just move forward here so the first question you know was not one that required any fancy statistics or math at all which was just can you actually detect these fevers earlier because these patients are like amongst the most highly monitored non-intensive Care Unit type of patients because again every four hours nurses are in there around the clock you know waking them up taking their vitals um because they're at risk of getting really sick and so we just wanted to see what if we had every two minute data does it make a difference and so I won't go into the details here but you know we we came up with some definitions that working definitions of how do we Define a fever event because you can you know oftentimes people get a fever but then it stays High then a day later there's more again it's fever like were they two different things were they one thing we came up with some working definitions that that made sense at least clinically to be able to identify these fever events and then we said okay here's a bunch of separate fever events for each event you know who who found it uh quicker was it the clinical standard of care or was it this device that patients self-applied they didn't do it perfectly a lot of times there was missing data and all of that and these are the results here of of the patients here and if you go top to bottom in panel B here right so each one of these is a different fever event HCT means it was a stem cell transplant patient number 12 here car T patient number 20 and time 0 here is actually when it was detected by the clinical standard of care you know nursing vitals and if it's to the left of this the graph it says how much it was detected sooner by the continuous monitoring and if it's to the right it was detected like later by the continuous monitoring and then a number of hours you know is shown here and what you can see here is almost all of these cases it was detected sooner but a continuous monitoring the three cases where it was later when we went back it was actually missing data the patch didn't connect well there were some issues and the other interesting thing well the other overall big picture on this right is for infections actually we also went in into the records and said what was this fever caused by was it by an infection was it by the cytokine release syndrome or was it by there are even other things like sometimes with a blood transfusion or there are other other things that can cause fevers and this was quite striking it was 18 hours earlier and that that was striking to us from a very clinical standpoint because these patients are getting every four hour temperatures so how are we picking this up 18 hours earlier right I mean I'm not surprised this is what we expected you know this was our hypothesis but I I'm very excited because from a very practical sense you know we really believe that that can make a big big difference you know for in terms of these outcomes of patients getting these infections but then even for the cytokine release syndrome which is a type of thing that happens super fast like from the morning to the end of the day a patients can be looking great and then be like going to the ICU you know it looked like there was a four hour lead time and then I'll just mention briefly that when we looked at the patterns of this this is just very visual right now we want to get more data and go back and really apply some some more systematic you know learning techniques to this um but we could see that there are actually two patterns you know one pattern was now in in um in Orange here is the standard of care fever and okay over here this big line here and what you see in this pattern is sometimes like a day before the temp track uh the you know the continuous monitoring found a little blip it's almost like the body was trying to mount a fever and then it actually came down and I'm I my own speculation on this is that you know counter regulatory feedback mechanisms come back in and they actually tried to thermoregulate again back to a you know a baseline but then if there's really something going on like an infection eventually takes off again it was that that's my speculation um but we saw this pattern that sometimes you would actually see this like more than a day before there's this kind of event and then in other cases we saw a different pattern you know where um it's just that the fever became established very quickly it's just that the continuous monitoring seemed to pick it up you know more sensitively than the uh than the standard of care so the other thing now that's what I think is a question more I mean it's all exciting but this is this is definitely super interesting I think from the prediction standpoint the other question is could we use high frequency this hftm we call it high frequency temperature monitoring to actually predict the fever before it occurs and this was again good luck on our part and actually a good I think it was sung who connected us right song and srijan Sen who connected us to Danny's group you know um uh and the hypothesis here was was actually related to circadian rhythm as I mentioned like body temperature even though it's tightly regulated within a person between people it varies but also within a person it varies according to the clock essentially according to the circadian clock and and um and and again in clinical medicine that is not taken into account in terms of routine clinical medicine nobody says well you were 37.9 degrees but you know know it was in the middle of the night so that's when your body temperature is supposed to be lower so that we should count that as a fever like that's just not in the in in that world right now and Danny's group you know has been working on circadian models for like what 20 plus years and so uh it was just very fortuitous that we were able to get together and and um uh in this work that I'm showing you right now uh uh Jonathan Tyler postdoc and Caleb mayor and and Danny's group worked with a postdoc named Chris Flora in my group and they got together to process this data and then apply these models that that the Circadian models they've come up with to essentially um for each patient right for each person Define a a mathematical model with with the right uh parameters that basically are fit to that person's Baseline Data before they get the fever and then the question and I'm going to be oversimplifying again that's why it's great these guys are here so if anybody has details tell questions I'm sure they can answer them but but then the basic idea was if you know that you've modeled this person's body temperature and this is the profile can you then look at the actual data that actually comes in and see if it deviates from what that prediction is and then that basically defines a circadian residual and then you can also look at the average temperature and what you actually expect for this person's profile see if that deviates so that's a kind of a mean temperature residual and putting those residuals together they came up with a metric to be able to um to actually uh to actually look at this metric over time and and what happens and so I won't go into the details here I think I sort of explained it um at least in in high terms we can come back to it if anybody has specific questions but I'll just get to the punch line here but using this approach and using this idea of difference in residual between what's predicted from the model and what's actually happening in individual patients but here's the data from a number of different patients all put together even though the modeling is done you know at the individual level this is what they saw is that this difference in residual you know up before 12 hours is pretty much a zero so like there isn't really any deviation but then somewhere around 12 hours before it seems to start deviating and then the green is whereas there's statistical significance the the sample size was relatively small here was probably only about 20 or so fever events but what is exciting to me is a couple of things one is there was some evidence that there really is some signal there right and Time Zero is when the fever actually is happening right so all this is happening before the fever and then of course the other thing that's really exciting to me is this graph that we had put in that in that um in that net that perspective article right to me like this right here is this transition state right here at least that's what I I hope we're we're starting to get some sort of sense of and um it turns out that if you then Analyze This by fever cause by infection you know it's you know this is sort of what you see and I would sort of ignore some of the statistic and it will not ignore but give it take it with a grain of salt I think the statistical significance um uh the specific timing of when that shows up um but at least closer to the fever you know it seems like there is signal and of course there there's that signal is much closer to the actual time of fever only with the cytokine release syndrome which as I told you even clinically happens to really quickly so um the bottom line here is that we could we found that you can detect the fever early with this wearable device right to measure the temperature and that the computational analysis can identify at least a potential or some signal there maybe three to eight hours before but you know that has to be kind of nailed down and and this stuff actually got published with again with Chris and Jonathan as the co-first authors if anybody's interested you can go and look at that and the other thing I'll mention so Dave wook is here and and he with Caleb in in uh in uh and Danny's group are now actually working on the second generation kind of of this which I think is even cooler so I mean this was cool but I think is is is moving things even further so uh definitely excited about this and another reason of course the big picture reason I'm excited about this is just the impact of this and the first is this earlier detection of these fever-related events and we did all this work in these inpatients who are getting these very special Therapies but there's you know like hundreds hundreds of thousands of patients every year getting chemotherapy and every patient almost every most of the patients who get chemotherapy are at risk of neutropenia so like they're essentially their neutrophils their main line of defense right of the immune system of the innate immune system essentially gets wiped out for a week or two um depending on you know what kind of chemotherapy they're getting and they're at risk of of these kinds of infections so I think the the real um hope with this is that yes it can maybe improve in hospital care but this kind of thing when it's done with patients at home who'll get their chemotherapy and they get home that it can actually pick up these infections sooner so they don't come in and get sepsis and die from that it you know it's not a high rate of death you know it's probably you know a few percentage but when you look at the total number of patients every year and that that's quite a bit um and there can also be a lot of complications from getting sepsis and I think the other exciting thing is and I hope and I know Danny's hope has been this for forever is that there will be a circadian informed definition of fever perhaps going forth you know at some type at some time and and then the other thing I want to mention of course you know we want to add more data streams and get that kind of data and and I think that that's only gonna improve you know what we're what we're trying to do at least in in this particular case in other applications too and so some of the next steps are you know further optimization and you know Danny's group is it's working on that evaluation in larger data sets we're working on collecting more data um you know looking at fever cause can the pattern of the fever not just tell us there's fever but this is infection and this is you know something else um we've started to think about doing a clinical trial of if you actually incorporate this into patients who are going home after chemotherapy can you actually improve their outcomes uh and that's that's sort of the outpatient stuff and and I'll tell you a little story actually about this this that didn't employ the predictive monitoring but one of the the studies we did was with again with sung she's a pediatric oncologist so we started giving these patches out to patients kids you know and and their parents were going home and there were three cases in which uh at home the the parent actually called the the you know the person on call and said you know my kid had chemotherapy and uh this device is actually saying there's a fever um what should I do and then this was research only so you know they were instructed at the hospital this is research only you know this is not going to be used for clinical care so the doctor on the phone says well why don't you take an oral temperature so they take the temperature in one case they couldn't take a temperature because it was a baby and it was too fussy the other two cases in adolescence I took the temperature and they said oh temperature oil temperature says everything is okay it's not a fever and so they were told like well just just watch it it's okay we don't know then the night went went past you know overnight and then the morning the parent calls again and says I'm taking the oral temperature but it's not giving me a fever but this device is saying there's a fever and so now they said well okay since you're like super concerned about this why don't you come in and in both of those cases they came in and this kid was basically on the verge of sepsis had a low blood pressure you know had a serious infection because the kid came in they got the antibiotics started much sooner than than otherwise and so I just mentioned that like that that I don't know sometimes you know this the stuff we're doing it it can translate pretty pretty quickly and and pretty easily and and with a lot of uh meaning I think in that particular case so we actually did end up publishing that as a just as a Case Case series um you know just because it's again like I it I boggles my mind it boggles my mind and it doesn't Boggle my mind because I know how the system works I know all the you know there's good reasons for all the you know inefficiencies but some inefficiencies there's not good reason for it right so it really I guess it motivates me in the end to see that there are some things that can that can change so profoundly and so I will uh you know just mention actually these are some of those things right we have to go through clinical validation there's FDA stuff there's a lot of a lot of stuff that plays into this and I'm happy to talk to people offline if anybody's interested in in that kind of stuff and I'd like to leave you with just one other little thing of probably just a couple of a few slides and this is about future possibilities and certainly like today we're totally interested in this and and and putting effort into like can we expand this can we do more patients can we do more sensors you know go beyond infection and other things but where is this all going right and I just want to share with you my own view of it my own perception of of the reality and I think that early detection of various illnesses like infections and all that that stuff's moving forward it's going to move forward you know just as a field you know how quickly it moved forward will depend on a lot of different factors but there's also another elephant I might talk about the elephant in the room first which is we have our reactive Medical Care System instead of proactive but the other another elephant in the room in my view um is that even though a lot of our research when it comes to medical illness is really focused on the cellular biology the molecular biology the physiology you know the whatever right a lot of this disease that we're dealing with especially in the U.S I would say you know is related to health related Behavior it's related to you know I would say psychological distress psychological differences in perception that ultimately you know affect the physiology um and so I just leave you on this you know one of the things that I'm personally sort of seeing on the horizon and very hopeful for is that a combination of the wearable sensors which allows us to get at the physiology right along with a lot of mobile self-reporting that's now you know a lot more easier essentially to do could perhaps finally make a dent in this in this axis here which has been really stuck I think for a very long time and I don't know I'm not giving you any details about it but um but you know the the big picture idea is you know at some point could we get enough data on subjective States and Link it to objective physiological States so at some point the physiology data can actually inform us about what's happening up here and in here and and ultimately uh you know use that to actually support the the change in Behavior you know which I think we are stuck as a society because you know it's our brain our brain you know I think more and more Neuroscience as far as I can tell you know is identifying why behavioral change is so difficult you know we we have a certain patterns of wiring essentially you know that that uh that maybe these kind of devices could actually support and rewiring so that that's what I wanted to just say there um song and I and and Danny actually you know we've worked on a project with students that's starting to take a very first step in that direction and I just like to acknowledge I think I've acknowledged you know a lot of the people you know already here I also not like to of course acknowledge the patients and the families who participate in all of this in in the Taubman Institute and and two NIH training grants that that supported this so I'll stop there thank you so much foreign oh for Zoom okay all right so um so I am excited about the Circadian component to it and I was wondering how many days of training data you need in order to get good predictions and do the predictions get better if you have more trading data like if you had people start before they even came to the hospital would that potentially make it so you could catch fever even faster yeah so I'm going to answer it partly and I'm going to turn over to see if they will Kim and Danny have something to add so I know Jonathan and Chris when they were and Caleb when they were working on this looked at like 48 to 72 hours was the amount of training data um we don't know if you looked at it or more so we don't know we don't have that data I mean this was basically limited to what we were doing but I know now day work you you have been working on some methods that can use even less data and the other thing I should just mention which is I think really nice about the Circadian approach is you can have a lot of missing data and still will get a decent fit and that that's actually really nice but they look do you want to add to that or Danny yeah so for that work uh we need to fit some parameters for the model so we use the first 24 hour data to fit this uh to estimate the circuit and rhythm in the body temperature and then yeah using only using the the 24 hour data we can predict the FIFA about six hour ride yes yeah and another uh the future currently we're working with actually to use that method uh we have to compare the free fever day data and fever day data that means this is not a real-time method so now we currently are developing a real-time Beaver detection method uh yeah that's it so we currently use the some motion learning method and to train the motion uh we need uh some like 24 hours data as well yeah that's all I smack there just sort of following up on the self-reporting uh matter how much of a learning curve do you think is required for the patients to be able to recognize what's what's deviant enough to report uh or the pretty things pretty obvious yeah I think it's it's so context dependent um and I feel like it's the whole area is just in the nasancy right so there's in the sociology world like they've been doing this ecological momentary assessment another I'd say fancy term for basically the same thing where randomly throughout the day you know you query people and they with certain questions and so forth so I I think it totally depends on on the context you know if it's a very specific thing like I know people are doing this for smoking cessation you know so you're actually asking how you know on a scale of one to ten right what's your urge right now to smoke when's the last time you smoked I mean but that's could be a very very focused thing right but if you're looking for other things like anxiety state you know that's one of the things with song uh you know this this project and the student population which we've been doing it was just mood and it was just a one question you know per day yeah it's hard for me to answer the question because it's so I think depends on the particular context for some context there might be a huge learning curve for other ones it might be simple and also how much does it vary how frequently do you have to sample you know to get something consistent we don't know but I think those are kind of things that that are possible and also I feel like the technology for doing that is evolving I've been in touch a bit with the information and a school school information you know investigators here and and even like like if you ask those queries from a smart watch versus a smartphone how much how much more can you practically get you know per day and all of that sorry I don't have a better answer except that it's early and I think exciting from that standpoint yeah uh thank you for the uh presentation I really enjoyed it um I have a couple questions um my first is so is like the best product for measuring body temperature on the market right now continuously that baby patch um or was that just used because of ease or is that like genuinely the best thing that we have that's a great question so we went through years of trying different temperature monitoring devices and I would not and so when we say best um I look at it as a composite best right so there's best technical best in terms of the analytical precision and sensitivity is the best other elements of technical best right is how much noisy data do you get but then there's also another element which is patient compliance usability consistency and so we started out with this this band that you would actually no it was not a there was a band that you had to wear and then there was a sticker and that was really good like it's a really high quality data but people would not wear this band for more than like you know half a day and later I found out the US military was using the same thing and they're soldiers and they wouldn't wear that for more than like two days so so I would say and then we worked with a startup company that had a very nice device but you know they end up running out of money so we went through lots of different iterations and I would say this is the best we could find that actually people would use and it was you know user friendly enough is it the best that's possible I doubt it because I don't think anything is the best that's possible things are always evolving but there's so many forces that go and come into play I mean someone may have a better one but then if they don't have a production and distribution and FDA approval path you know then that becomes less best so and a complicated answer but that's where we're at all right yeah um and then my other question was um I guess just more generally related to the wearable sensors um you know for some of the stuff I'm thinking like particularly related to like sleep or maybe some of the more obscure um types of things that you're trying to measure like some of the accuracy of the data is a little bit sketchy or potentially a little bit qualitative um you know it's not necessarily there yet like how do you see that impacting the role of research like do you think it's valuable even if the data isn't yeah quite as good as we might like yeah no I totally get the question and and yes I mean I guess my answer is yes it is valuable but you know it's always like both right so when I started out with this too with the temperature I was really concerned that we were getting this skin patch and it was not really estimating core body temperature and all of that and even with sleep you know when we started out you know with some other studies you know neurologists were telling us like there's no way don't even think about sleep data and it's still an issue you know in terms of like you're saying especially for Sub sub staging you know different stages of sleep accurately and all of that but I think with everything it comes into context it comes into the question you're asking the number of patients in the population size and all of that so if you have a large population size with some moderate quality data right and you're asking a question that can be answered with that quality data you might be fine just like with our circadian you know the Circadian modeling our quality of data is great but if we came up with a different question or a different approach we're trying to apply that required better data it would fail so I guess this is It's partly philosophy so my My Philosophy is that we don't know as much as we think we know a lot of times going into things you know I know I definitely don't sometimes I've been really naive and sometimes I've been thinking I know everything and I really don't so I I think it's this you know for certain questions the data is crap and you can't answer those questions for other questions the data might be good enough especially if you have a large enough sample size the problem and the challenge I think is a lot of times you don't know that a priority going in and that's research in my in my view hey uh your your point about how there needs to be like a fever definition for everybody on an individual basis that made me think of this uh paper I read a long time ago where they were arguing that body temperature has changed over time since we first started measuring it I think it went down but I don't quite remember um do you know anything about that I think there was a lot of debate over whether it was like an artifact of like better measurementation um or whether or not this was like a real phenomenon um so like what do you think of on like that debate yeah and do you think these wearable sensors will maybe help us uncover why it happened that's happened if it is happening yeah so I had not actually I'm not familiar with that paper but it would not surprise me that something like that could happen because in the end you know like I was strung that complex network of interactions that ultimately determine the temperature set point right like there's still environmental input right that that that goes into that set point and so to the extent that over the past hundred years our environment has changed and environment can be physical environment but it's also dietary changes right obesity I mean you know that that's also our internal environment you know the inflammatory milieu of the body if you just take obesity as an example right is very different now than it was a hundred years ago for the you know average person or typical average whatever typical person model person so it would not surprise me that that could change because it's a system and you have different parameters back then and like you tweak the knobs now because the environment has changed internal and external and so the set point can change I would be surprised if it's changed like one degree but you know if it changed 0.1 degree or 0.2 degree you know a little bit that wouldn't surprise me it's kind of the same you know with the you know circadian parameters I mean these guys know more but I would I would about that but I would imagine again our environment has changed with light exposure and all of that right so so if you if you were to do some circadian measures I mean I assume you guys would agree like you would say oh the Circadian measures or things have changed you know well it's because now you know things are different right I mean environment's different compared to pre-electricity essentially electric bulb or whatever I don't know if you guys have anything to add you want to add to that or yeah yeah thank you monish yes I was just Googling and you know I found some interesting things and I'd remembered some of that stuff so one post talks about the body temperature of man uh born in the early 1990s is on average 1.06 Fahrenheit degrees lower than men born in the early 1800s and uh there's more you know about women and you know 0.58 and you know and it's saying that uh normal body temperature in both men and women have decreased donatonically by 0.03 degrees C per birth decade since the Industrial Revolution so it's kind of interesting you know yeah that is super interesting it starts to me thinking about the microbiome and you know exposed to back then compared to because that drives the rates of all those enzymatic reactions I mean yeah I can't I don't think you took my version of physical chemistry when you're a student here but you know I used to teach it as you know and you know those enzyme reactions go 10 degrees C to 10 degrees is like 10x exactly well you can see you know enzyme and some reactions in the gut microbiome you can see all kinds of things changing oh for sure it's fascinating yeah it is any other questions well if not one thing I just wanted to say is a big takeaway from this talk because you know I know not everybody in this room is into wearable sensors per se but I assume you're into bioinformatics and data science you know in some way um but the one thing I think I I can I would like to share with you because I think there's probably not as many MD types or whatever in in the audience it's just it's just that what you're doing whether it's single cell genomics or it's you know uh wearable devices or it's you know whatever EHR data science or whatever but it really is important that's all I can say it really is important because nothing moves in medicine without in all this kind of work so so anyway so thank you
