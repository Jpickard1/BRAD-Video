okay let's get started but it's my pleasure to introduce dr. Emily Murali who is a joint faculty candidate between infectious disease and DCM B and I think her direct recruitment by these two departments is really a reflection of her being a true interdisciplinary scientist so she got her PhD from MIT and the computational biology and systems biology program in the lab of Forrest white where she applied experimental and modeling approaches to decipher in vivo phosphorylation networks from there she went on to her postdoc at NYU and she's joint between the labs at Richard Bono and Dan Littman who are respectively aficionados in distance biology and immunology and I think bridging those two worlds is had a lot of exciting potential and I'm always been doing work you know working with computational experimental scientist or postdoc to generate really exciting datasets and apply novel analytical techniques to try to reconstruct ecological and molecular networks underlying host microbe interactions so with that I'll let and we do the rest and thank you so much for coming and we're very excited to be here to talk uh thanks everyone for being here to listen to my talk I'm really excited to be here and so just to start off I'd like to introduce on the gut ecosystem so here we have cartoon and just to orient you the top we're looking at the lumen so the contents of the gut and then on the bottom we're looking at the alignment of propria the lining underneath the gut and then these are a line of epithelial cells that separates you from your microbial lumen content and one of the reasons I like this figure is because you don't have to worry about the names on it but there are a bunch of different immune cell types represented and there are numerous microbial pack through that are represented and then something to make this figure especially nice is that they actually represented some heterogeneity in the epithelial cells - so this ecosystem has a lot of different component and it turns out that alterations in this in in this ecosystem can contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases and so as a specific example I'd like to introduce the micro segmented filamentous bacteria which I'll abbreviate as s FB and it was discovered as one of the first examples of a commensal gut resident microbe that played a role in autoimmune disease and so here we're looking at a false colored image and you can see the small intestine villi sticking out here and the SSV is a seg pigmented like long filamentous structure that's in very close contact to the epithelial cells and it turns out that these mites have interesting phenotypes um and these microbes can induce changes in immune cell population so here the reference is another picture of the gut and we have um this is 4s fb- it's also mice lacking and FFP we have a couple of cell types through their dendritic cells they have long dead rights that can stick into the lumen and actually sample the contents uh there are th17 cells i else III which you'll notice there are just a couple of th17 cells in this figure and when you have sfe in as a member of the gut microbiome it leads to an expansion of these th17 cells and these 217 cells um are associated with Pro inflammatory responses and they are important for fighting pathogens in particular microbes and fungi but they're also implicated in autoimmune diseases so they contribute to different autoimmune diseases and one of the things that I'd like to just summarize here is that if you start off with mice that don't have sfv and then you give them say a fecal gavage of containing ffb the process of induction of 17 cells involved multiple host cell types takes place in multiple body site locations different parts of the intestine involved mesenteric lymph nodes and then the expansion of th17 cells unfolds over a time course and so at early time points you don't have these th17 cells but unique responses some cell type later on you get an expansion and so this is a complex process involving a number of different cell types and it leads to some interesting phenotype so um SFP+ mites they are more likely to bite off pathogenic of infections for example citrobacter infection which is a mouse model of e.coli food poisoning but they're also more likely to develop mouse models of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease and also it's just multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis involving the central nervous system or the joints so autoimmune diseases that are not proximal to the gut but actually further further away so this particular microbe through its induction of th17 cells influences host systemic immunity as just one more quick example of another gut microbe that has an immuno modulating effect I just want to introduce helical back to hip Atticus and wild-type mice presence of odd Helicobacter promotes an anti inflammatory response but if you look at mice with inflammatory bowel disease associated mutations for example ablation of Isleton signaling these mice actually develop spontaneous colitis which is a model for inflammatory bowel disease so these are a two example of microbes that affect host immunity and interestingly for both of these models there have been studies that have shown that not only does it matter that the presence of the single microbe is in the gut it matters what other microbes are present - suggesting that the whole ecosystem contributes to the mouse phenotypes and so when we're thinking about a cartoon of FFP this is a little bit ugly and scary but you can you should be thinking about the whole ecosystem and also many different types of immune cell jump through many different types of immune cells and so on when thinking about trying to study the system it's almost overwhelmingly complex and when you have a system that involves a lot of different interacting parties I one great source of scientific tools come from engineering and mathematical modeling framework have the sophistication of being able to describe this kind of network and so I'd like to describe to you an ro1 grant that I wrote with my two advisers who study the gut ecosystem and so the design of the study involved the perturbation timecourse experiment where at time zero you stimulate with our you induce a cytokine blockade cutting off either i'll 23 or il-10 signaling both of these signaling pathways have previously been associated with human inflammatory bowel disease via genome-wide Association studies and so you kind of layer onto these mice a genetic defect that has been known to influence autoimmunity in humans and then two weeks later you lay around a microbial perturbation adding s fe h p-- atticus or control but these two microbes of course have been associated with autoimmune disease already so this is kind of an experimental model of for how an autoimmune disease might develop ah due to a genetic predisposition for an autoimmune disease layered on with this case of microbial perturbation to cause autoimmune phenotypes and so this is the time course what kind of measurements are we hoping to make and what kind of models are we want to get out of it and so um as far as measurements were interested in measuring immune cell populations using flow cytometry so to figure out which populations of immune cells are changing we're interested in 16s rRNA DNA sequencing to get microbial compositions to see how the microbes are changing over the course of the experiment and then we're also interested in measuring host responses at the molecular level using RNA seek and atactic technologies which I'll describe in more detail later we're interested in multiple host cell types and looking at different body site and then from me the way that I'm really excited about putting this together is in a mathematical model and so we're interested in two levels of mathematical modeling one we want to be able to predict the evolution of microbial and immune cell populations first of all we'd like to be able to describe it over the course of this time course and then be able to do computational experiments where we can say what happens if we they remove some of these microbes their immune cell populations how would that change the evolution of the system and the second aim is to build transcriptional regulatory models of immune cells responding to these perturbations in vivo and so I'll go into more detail for both of those but one of the things I wanted to focus on although these goals seem really different population level models molecular level model and they do have different challenges they do share some similarities so data from both of these models are and what's known as the underdetermined regime so I have two data set this is a data set of microbial abundances we have two hundred and ten packs so that are measured hundred samples here's another data set and we have gene expression measurement so about 5,000 genes and a hundred samples which you can see in both of these cases is that you have more measurements than you have number of samples and if we're trying to say and for ecological interactions then we actually have many many more interactions their parameters to be estimated the number of samples and so this leads to some practical implications number one seem to be too many parameters to estimate and so sometimes it's not possible to find a solution or sometimes it's possible to find many solutions and a lot of those are going to be wrong and so you know if you're working in this regime you're at a very serious risk of coming up with spurious results and so just to give you a basic framework and appreciation for some of the inference methods that I'm using I wanted to point out the general strategies that I'm using so you start with an underpowered data set be it microbial abundances gene expression and you want to get out a set of accurate models and so one of the things that we do on our inference procedures is we try to integrate external data on higher knowledge and then another thing we try to integrate our assumptions and just as an example one assumption that we make is that in both microbial ecological networks and transcriptional regulatory networks is that the underlying set of interactions are sparse and so here I've Illustrated this with a picture of two toy microbial networks and the basic idea in contrast here's a dense Network where there are all of the microbes our populations are interacting with each other are presented by line and then sparse network and so this is our assumption when we're building these networks that on average for example for thinking in terms of microbial networks your average microbial taxa doesn't interact with most of the other microbial taxa but maybe just a handful and so just to move on and show you a little bit about what I've done in the domain of ecological interaction Network inference one of our first challenges is to build and the goal here is dynamic population models of microbes and immune cells in the gut but one of the problems is that a lot of these microbes for example are known only on the basis of their sequences and I can't be cultured externally and we don't actually know what the ecological interactions are so on if there's a mutualistic interaction if two microbes are in competition with each other and so one of the first challenges to even building a dynamic model is actually figuring out what are the ecological interaction and so just to phrase the goal more clearly we have a table of OTU seems for operational taxonomic unit so that's a level of microbial taxonomy so you can think of this as a microbial taxa versus a sample and we want to come up with a computational method that tells us what are the equal lid ecological interactions among those ot use and here and this is represented as a graph where the nodes or circles are representing microbial taxa and then the edges in represents an interaction that's that's the goal and I did this work in collaboration with two computational biologists in the vanilla back hurts and Christian Muller and I'm going to just very very briefly go through that what I think are the key points but this work is published and I'd like to focus more on the transcriptional regulatory networks because that's not published I'm just going to summarize briefly here our method is called speakeasy and it seems first bars inverse covariance estimation for ecological Association inference and again the inputs and outputs are known there are two parts to the software that we've released the first is a network inference pipeline where we learn a sparse Gaussian graphical model and I'm happy to talk about more of these details afterwards or my chalk talk tomorrow the other part that I'm very proud of is a realistic synthetic data generator and one of the challenges with inferring equal logical interaction is there are no experimentally validated large-scale ecological networks so you can come up with a pipeline that you think is going to be very good but how do you actually know it's good and so one of the major challenges we had with convincing ourselves this method was good was being able to generate realistic synthetic data specifically correlated over dispersed counts data from models of known topologies and so one of the things that you can do with it's method is you can actually generate synthetic data that matches in a statistical sense your input dataset and be able to see how well this method recovers on your particular data set okay and then ah this particulate so the output is of an interaction Network and as is done by patch loss and touch losses lab and previous publication it can be used as kind of a skeleton or scaffold for building a more complex model because it can tell you which parameters to focus on if you know a priori that some interactions their presence and some are not so you can reduce some of the parameters that you have to estimate so this would form the back rat backbone of dynamic models and currently in the Linnaean lab we're working on collecting the data set for the ecological models and so now I'd like to describe in pretty on pretty gross detail the transcriptional regulatory networks that I've been building and so the minoan Lippman labs have a history of collaborating together to build transcriptional regulatory networks and immune cell types and the first collaboration was to develop a network of th17 cells which I already said were important cells in protecting the body against pathogen but also implicated in autoimmune disease and this was a very serious collaboration and that involved the generation of a huge data set so there were 11 transcription 11 at TF chip seek experiment there are 28 transcription factor TF va's abbreviation for transcription factor knockout experiment about 150 rna-seq experiments and then I in order to make this network they also included this microarray immune cell compendium gene expression data set called M gen and came out with up with this final network and this scale of a project was really possible because th17 cells have been studied to the extent that they could we knew the conditions for developing th17 cells in vitro in tissue culture and so although inspiring and a great proof of concept and a lot of different in a lot of regards this is very different from what's proposed in this grant we're interested here in a physiological setting and looking at responses to these perturbations so these this is this is in vivo on transcriptional regulatory networks and so off the bat we know that we cannot generate the scale of datasets because sample is going to be limiting in this context and so let me show you a little bit more but one of the first things that we decided to focus on was to infer transcriptional regulatory networks in a newly discovered last five or six years immune cell type known as innate lymphoid cells and this is in collaboration with Maria / cross key and Jason hall in the Lippman lab and I'm not going to go too much into the immunology but these three odd innate lymphoid cells ILC subtypes they live at new costal interfaces and each of them play unique roles in homeostasis and also have been implicated in different autoimmune diseases and just like to highlight IOT threes because they're actually involved in the induction an SSP induction of th17 cells which i mentioned briefly importantly as an exciting research topic little is known about their gene expression and regulation so there's a lot to learn and one of the challenges is that these cells are relatively rare so there are only about 10 to the fifth of these cells in the small intestine of a mouse for example and it's not known how to expand all three of these cell types in tissue cultures so they really do have to be studied ex vivo ah before I describe the mathematics of transcriptional regulatory Network and friends I just want to show you in cartoons on the kind of model that I'm trying to build and so here we have a model of sis gene regulation here's a gene locus and we have bound this to that gene or bounces the gene locus different transcription factors they're nearby they might be playing a role in regulating this genes expression and in another cell type you might expect to have some of the same transcription factors involved but maybe some different transcription factors as well and Ketu of genome-wide figuring out where transcription factors are bound across the genome then chip seek experiments and so here's an exact are tune of the kind of data that you might get from a chip seek experiment for this blue transcription factor and here you see a problem each of these experiments requires about 10 to the seventh cells about two orders of magnitude more than our presence in a mouse gut and really if you wanted to build a high-quality genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network it would be nice to have data for all the relevant transcription factors so really not feasible for innate lymphoid cells and so the breakthrough and technology that really enabled this project is a new data type known as a taxi assay for transposes accessible chromatin and I'm just going to show you in cartoon form the kind of data that you get from this assay so it basically shows you what part of the chromatin is nucleosome-free or accessible and you can see that these peak corresponds to where transcription factors are bounced so there's a good correlation between these nucleosome-free region and transcription factor binding but the problem here is that we don't know which transcription factor was binding in with inaccessible region and so the missing piece of information is partially filled in using a motif data so different transcription factors have different affinities for particular DNA sequences and so by scanning the DNA for motif occurrences you can implicate a TF with a particular with particular piece and so this is how you can get chip seek like information out of a single experiment for integration with these dye motif databases and so the goal the idea here with them to combine gene expression and attack seek data to infer transcriptional networks in IELTS sees and the mathematical framework that we're using is sparse linear regression so basically for each gene we model it's on its expression as a multivariate combination of the transcription factor activities that regulate it and these coefficient betas can be positive or negative depending on whether that interaction is activating or inhibitory and we can solve this particular problem given a data matrix X transcription factors a and solve for this matrix the coefficient using a number of different methods the vanilla labs inference method is known as the infer later and our current method uses what's known as Bayesian best subset regression and so this is published I came out I think in 2013 and so it uses a couple of tricks to get to a limited set of potential regulators of particular gene and so one of them is this method enables you to incorporate external information so if you happen to have information from a database or some other source and you know that a transcription factor it does indeed regulate a gene you can incorporate that by including it in we use it G prior which will then bias the model to be more likely to explain a genes expression pattern with the transcription factor that's known to influence already and then we are able to make sure that we get that we are able to incorporate the sparsity assumption using a bayesian information criteria for model selection and basically the bayesian information score is a balance between model fit and complexity or number of parameters in the model so by calculating the Bayesian information criteria we are able to get a sparse as far as farce fit of the data and so this kind of gives you an idea of how we go about building it stuff before I left out one of the most important parts the predictors what actually are transcription factor activities and on last year people were estimating transcription factor activities on looking at the transcription factors mRNA levels and of course this is imperfect because a lot happens odd between being a piece of mRNA and being an active transcription factor and if we really wanted to make good predictions it would be great to have some say protein based assay of transcription factor activity but usually we don't have that data and in that case of transcription factor activities are really you think of them as hidden variables so you know the transcription factors gene expression level something happens and the active transcription factor you know are unmeasured but are influencing gene expression and so other groups have suggested that you can estimate a transcription factors activity by looking at the expression of its target genes and so on here we have another equation where you have a matrix of the target gene and then you incorporate information from prior and basically so the prior will have is basically a table where you have transcription factors versus target genes and a1 would indicate that you have a positive interaction 0 no interaction negative one an inhibitory interaction and then there actually uh this doesn't have an exact solution but using least squares approximation you can solve for a the activities and then plug back up in here and then use the in for the solve this and I this idea I've ended up working great in B subtlest and so B subtlest is a really well studied model organism and so there's database with thousands of known transcription factor gene interaction and this has been recently published in MSP and I I will say one of the cool things from this paper of this prior it's based on a database of high quality interaction but they also did experiments in this paper where they mix into the quality prior matrix of false interactions and test it on a leave out set and they found that actually the method was pretty robust even if you outnumbered on good interactions to random false interactions ten to one and so it's always an improvement regardless of if your prior is perfect in our hand to actually calculate transcription factor activities instead of just using the mRNA level and so this seems very exciting but I don't have a database like this for an eight lymphoid cells there are about twenty interactions that are known and so this is where the attacks seek data comes in and so the basic idea was to use this epigenetic data to get that prior matrix of transcription factor gene interaction just to be a little bit more specific on when I was building the prior and this is what I call the simple prior I would associate a transcription factor with a gene if that transcription factor is motif fell in an accessible region that was plus or minus 10 KB of that gene so a little bit arbitrary but that's that's how I built the prior matrix and then the idea of course is then to take that prior combine it with a gene expression data set run now what I call in for a later BBS are TFA and come up with an attack and for a later network and just to give you a little bit of a sense of how using a prior and transcription factor activity estimate looks like here we go back to the th17 data set and we have at the top this western blot that shows protein levels across 0 to 96 hours and below we have matched on microarray gene expression data from 0 to 96 hours so the same time course and below we have transcription factor activities as estimated from probably our best type of prior based on chip and knockout data and in particular I just wanted to point out that I've got 3 activity correlates very nicely with phospho stat 3 abundance and phosphorylated stat 3 as a proxy for stat 3 activation and it looks a lot better than today looking at just the mRNA level and so returning back to here we've made an improvement in prediction by basically improving our estimation of our predictors and so this seems like a great pipeline at least it did to me but there was a serious concern that both me and my collaborator had and she was as serious about ah you know this seems like a good pipeline but how do we know if it's good and so what what she did was she did she basically um also generated 33 ataxia experiments to benchmark and these were done in th17 cells for which we had all of the data already and so we could start to benchmark this method and so I'd like to show you some of the benchmark result before I go on to show you the results for the innate lymphoid cells so the first question is is a taxi kata a single experiment as useful as 11 chip seek experiments in key th17 transcription factors and so here's the pipeline that we came up for me with to make this comparison we could analogously see the way we developed an attack seek prior you could come up with a chip prior based on those 11 chip seek experiment and then as gene expression input we actually had three different gene expression data sets that we used and for each of those of data put that we could get a chip or in a taxi canet work and then in order to basically decide whether or not we were performing well we could look to see how well it correspond it to a network constructed from the knockout data so if you knock out a transcription factor and you see a change in a gene that's at least supportive that that transcription factor might be influencing that genes expression this um gold standard is not perfect because of course knockouts include indirect interactions and you also have network compensation so you might not see a change in a gene even if it is affected by a particular transcription factor so there's some caveat but all in all we would expect you know we'd feel good if these networks had some correspondence with a knock out data set and then the final idea it was once we were satisfied with the attack first chip seek comparison then we could go ahead and compare the attack seek networks to a better gold standard a gold standard consisting of a transcription factor gene interactions that were supported not only by knockout but also by chip data suggesting that that transcription factor also bounces for those genes so more likely to be a regulator and so we evaluated performance in a number of different ways but the one that I'll show you here it's precision recall and so basically a predicted Network is just a ranked list of transcription factor gene interaction and so what you can do is you can move down this rank list of interaction and calculate your precision the pretty percent of predicted edges that are actually in your gold standard and you can also calculate the recall the percentage of your gold standard network that you've actually captured at that particular cutoff and so here is some example of precision recall curve and um you can imagine having a list of you know high confidence interactions below confident and as you move down the list your of precision drops off and your recall would increase and here just for comparison you can see that this um method whatever it is is not performing as well it's precision drops off very quickly and so what a precision recall curves look like comparing the chip and a taxi and networks and so here we have precision recall ah this is the attack chip and this is comparison to not using a prior at all so the old and for later method and this is random background and so roughly speaking and I'm only showing you results for one of the gene expression data that we saw that chip and attack performed more or less similar similarly so they seem to both do at both represented improvement over not using a prior and one of the second questions we were interested in asking when we were doing the stage 17 benchmarking was well what if you didn't have any attack seek measurements that were done you know for the same experimental condition could you Pollan more general resources and so we constructed to what I would call generic priors and the first was based on the trust database which was generated using machine learning algorithms to basically text mind and find article that seems to indicate a transcription factor teen interaction and then they were manually curated by a group of 30 people and so it's actually a pretty high-quality database I was surprised by the quality of interactions that were in there I mean you'll see that it actually performs pretty well the other generic prior that we used with based on DNA hypersensitivity accessibility measurements in 25 different mount issues those part of the encode projects and basically foot printing was done in these accessible regions so this is kind of similar to what I'd done except for in random cell types that were not th17 and what we see is that these methods help to and if you then go ahead and rank combine these different priors you can get even better performance so some of the top performing priors for a combination of attack speak and trust and attack encode and Trust the one last th17 benchmarking comparison that I want to show you is so I told you about how I generated a simple attacks each prior but up until now I haven't shown you any attack seek data so one of the cool things about these data sets is they are quantitative so you can treat them in a quantitative manner I've here this is a heat map and we're looking at accessibility of 170,000 Peaks that were detected across these T helper cell samples and here's th17 time course and we have other key helpers that were controls in this experiment but you can see that they have very different trends so there's some quantitative information there and here I've just picked a random transcription factor that's expressed in 217 cells are XA Alpha and all of these clusters are enriched for the RSA our arcs our alpha motif and what I what I what I found striking with that so some of these clusters show decrease in accessibility over the course of these differentiation time course suggesting that arcs are alpha or whatever is contributing to that peak is finding maybe less strongly over the time course but then we also see enrichment in clusters where the accessibility is increasing over the course of the th17 to time course so that um exclamation the explanation here so we have different um we have motif enrichments the same are enrichment for the same motif but in clusters with different patterns so there probably due to different biological phenomena for example maybe the orange one is due to binding of arcs or alpha maybe the green ones due to rx R beta and rx our family member that has a degenerate motif or maybe they're due to differences in the proteins that are heterodimer izing with our X our alpha and so whatever the source of this reason this gave me the idea to try to take advantage of the quantitative nature of the taxi data and so I generated what I call a quantitative attack seek prior and basically I'm going to depict it here on odd use it just in picture and so for each expressed transcription factor instead of just looking to see whether there was a peak that was assist to a gene I looked at genes gene clusters so say genes that were just increasing under th17 condition and then I checked to see whether peak that had particular patterns say Peaks that were increasing and accessibility on under th17 conditions were enriched assist to these jeans and if they were then I added an edge in the prior connecting that TF to the jeans and so this is another way of generating a prior and here I'm going to show you results comparing to the better gold standard the knock out chip and you can see that when you include the quantitative information in combination with some of the genre generic priors you do get a little boost in a predictive power and I precision recall is one good way to look at these networks but it's also very nice to look at them in graphical form and so in in collaboration with a very talented software engineer at the Science Foundation Aaron waters I helped to design an AI Python notebook platform for network visualization where we were able to compare say this is the knockout chip gold standard these big hubs corresponds to the eleven transcription factors that were chipped and you can compare it to the inferred attack seek network attack seek met work and you could think on the network so you could compare between the two I'm not going to show you too many features but one of the things that we did two on being confidence in our method was to compare the key the key on th17 genes and transcription factor regulators to between both of the networks and what we see in general is that the taxi achmet works tend to be sparser so have fewer predictions than knock out odd chip but we're hoping that these networks become denser as we integrate more datasets so we're still in the building phase of combining more data set the other last thing I want to tell you about the th17 network is to emphasize these on networks are made only of transcription factors and you can see here's chip where you're limited to the TF so that you chip for and here's a taxi and so you can see that your coverage of the turns scription factor Network greatly increases and in stars are the transcription factors that my collaborator Maria cross her cross key thought should be in the th17 network the other ones are candidate candidates that have not previously been associated with th17 and so just to summarize here I the things that we learned from the th17 benchmark are that chip and attack seek derived priors do and improve performance of network inference in the mammalian setting i'm generic priors help and then finally it does seem reasonable to combine a taxi and gene expression measurements on in new cell types that haven't been previously explored and so with this benchmarking in hand we went on to build networks and innate lymphoid cells and here are some of the networks that we recovered so for shared and unique LT networks so I'll see one I'll see two zile t threes and then these are transcriptional regulatory interactions between TFS and genes that are shared between aisle t1s and IL t3 is shared between IL c 2 s and IL c 3 it's and what we were pleased to see with that for the few master transcription factors that were known in these innate lymphoid cells we were able to recover them and what was also very exciting is that we recovered 43 new transcription factors and across these networks there are 6,000 interactions here just to zoom in of previously for IL t 3r or gamma and t CF 7 were known to the master transcription factors you can see that we've expanded the number of regulators and these are the key on some key IL c 3 gene that we were pleased to see were in our network what are we doing with these networks so we have a plan for experimental validation and i one of the cool things about generating networks as opposed to just figuring out which transcription factors are key if you have a network you can actually figure out what on physiological role our role the genes that a transcription factors regulating are actually involved in so you might know what kind of phenotype to look for if you have a transcription factor knock out and here um unfortunately the experimental validation is going to be a lengthy process because we're not able to culture these cells in vitro and so basically our we plan we have plans for several candidate transcription factors you're going to use CRISPR interference to knock down transcription factors and IOC progenitors and then bone marrow transplant them into mice and see how the different ILC subtype developed from those TF knockdown four janitors and just to kind of bring us full circle I'd like so these networks that I built were all at steady-state but of course at the beginning I said that I wanted to build networks of immune cells responding to microbial perturbation and so a recent data that we have simply an N of one so don't pay too much attention to the genes that are listed here but we have basically done some experiments in lc3 all right yeah if we have some time course experiments so we have three days post of fecal gavage with either SFP+ fecal material air SFB negative and then we also have some steady-state measurements in SSD mono colonized mites and germ-free and we on the basis of other experiments decided to separate the ILC threes on the basis of surface markers and we see that the SKA positive in the CCR Scarlets got negative CCR six positive aisle C 3s have specific gene expression patterns in response to these different perturbations and so one of the things so we don't have a taxi data for this data set but we do have the X Febo study statement a taxi data set and so what I've done is I've taken that I'll see three networks that we have and basically expanded them so that they could explain the gene expression patterns that were seen in the figure before and these networks I would not also again not focus on the genes too much because it's 901 but this is this is the basic idea in progress toward the big goal um although I've just I've showed you I LC threes I'm also working on and a couple of other cell types I'm doing similar experiments with ex vivo attack seek and RNA seek measurement and see ah as far as progress on the ecological modeling we're still on figuring optimizing time points and exact conditions but this is part of the grant that I'm hoping to take with me and work on here when I start out on and then just to summarize these are the strategies that I've used here to build more accurate transcriptional regulatory models but there are a lot of different ways that you can improve these transcriptional regulatory networks so these are some of the things that I would like to do to further constrain the model building process and come up with more accurate models so first of all if you know something about the architecture of the network for example if it's scale-free or how many transcription factor targets you're Algrim average transcription factor could have anything about the network topology there are methods that are being developed to enable you if you know something already about what kind of network architecture to expect you can actually model that and use that to constrain another thing that I'm working on with others in the Brno lab is to learn networks simultaneously if you for example the il sees each of the subtypes has a unique and shared regulation so instead of learning each of those networks separately to try to share information between all three using what's known as a fusion penalty and I can talk more about that afterward or am i chalk talk tomorrow another way to improve these so I've actually thrown out a lot of the interesting or differential attack seek Peaks because they weren't plus or minus 10 KB of odd gene and of course I and so incorporating 3d chromatin information would be another way that we could improve the transcription factor model and then other ideas we're limited here to transcription factors protein transcription factors but it would be very cool to consider non-coding rnas and also maybe to explicitly model complex interactions so there are a lot of different ways that these that these networks could be improved and also a lot of these methods have kind of analogs in ecological network inference so finally my conclusions are that at the start of my postdoc I took a little bit of a risk deciding to be computation 100% computational and I was able to I've really enjoyed collaborating with experimentalist and I feel like we got a lot further teaming up together and so that was one of the things that I learned from this research experience I that I hope I've convinced you that ecological and transcriptional regulatory modeling although they seem very different I can benefit from similar assumptions and mathematical frameworks and then also that transcriptional regulatory Network inference is feasible using a taxi can gene expression data and although all the methods here I've been talking about immune cells there would obviously be applicable to any host cell or if we even had single cella microbial expression so they're there they're very general techniques finally I'd like to acknowledge a fair number of people so in the Vino lab very closely with all of these people especially Zack Kurtz and Cristian Muller on developing speak using the network the ecological network inference pipeline and then in the Lippman lab jason hall and especially maria proc  who poured over the networks that have generated and uh basically has been willing to team up with me to generate these datasets and also to do experimental validation i'd like to thank people at the Simons Foundation so Nick carrier has helped me set up my bioinformatics pipelines at the assignments foundation Aaron waters is the one who helped help me design the ipython notebook visualization for the network and also like to thank Aviv Modar who is the author of the th17 paper and really helped me working with that data set and doing a bunch marking all right and so with that I'd like to take any questions they may have very [Applause] nice thanks for the microbial interaction networks and perhaps the transcriptional networks as well sequence abundance is typically normalized to library size or sub sampled and so one tax or a gene increases some other gene or combination has to decrease that dependence interfere with the models or how do you how do you hear oh so you do have to handle that and in speakeasy we handle that explicitly so we borrow a data transformation from mathematical geology so we use a centered log ratio transformation on and basically use compositional data analysis techniques there are some theoretical results that in a high dimensional once we do that transformation in a high dimensional studying when we infer our inverse covariance matrix it actually is a good proxy for an inverse covariance matrix which would be based on the absolute abundances which is information of course we don't have but in a high dimensional setting using that transformation we we do account for it so we do expect that our results will be compositionally robust there with regards to the transcriptional regulatory networks and gene expression data thought compositional biases happen there's a trade-off between what's known as effective population size or the entropy of the data set and whether or not you'll have compositional artifacts so for example I've if you have so there are several ways that you could increase the entropy of will call a microbial abundance data set so you increase it so entropy would basically describe you know how little you know about something and so if you had a distribution so if you had a lot of microbial a measurement that would be a hot that you would have a higher entropy so entropy increases that you have an increased number of state but it also increases as your probability distribution flattens out so if you have a high AR you know equal probability of being spread and whereas a low entropy distribution you would have one microbe that was dominating so it turns out with transcriptional datasets compositional artifacts aren't a big deal because you have so many genes that you're measuring and you don't have one dominant gene as you might have for example and a microbiome data set and so we don't account for compositional effects and transcriptional data set but in the microbiome world my questions about the sparsity of the network how sparse that his depend on the range of diverse the subject assistant you sometimes more severe challenge like internet works faster or that by birthday I wonder it seemed architectural changes oh um we do it so would you repeat the question yeah so if you couldn't challenge the system just have a very simple steady state it has that you might at the one type of network architecture might be very sparse but if you push it to a very challenged state together and I see but more connections be made and therefore architecture itself could be a logical state sparsity can be scored yet another network characteristics that you can attract right so I don't know whether your benchmark data said has challenged the system sufficiently diverse to uncover all the potential edges all right so there are definitely limitations with the gold standard a knockout chip data and most likely it is to done at two dents of a gold standard and not representative because we're looking at the eleven key transcription factors in th17 and so those transcription factors automatically have a lot of target and what we're missing from our gold standard is a transcription factor that doesn't really play a role in PA 17 biology so definitely there's some bias there that side on we do have a collaboration with EJ ku true where we have a TR one data set and so he's going to be sharing with us I think about thirty to knockout experiments so I'm planning on benchmarking my methods in that system too but yeah there's definitely some bias and the benchmark that are used so you know factors in they nearly voice out three and then you said you went crisper than in dipper again it's a great back mm-hmm please make sense but maybe complicated the analysis this will have to my course of teachers have been testing there will be other selves with signatures you know factors like yes energy cells there we don't know how many cells will arrive to their these tissues so this potentially I see the approach makes a lot of sense but I'm not sure how realistic this will be to get information to ask the question how important are these predicted networks in the bowel of your system you know this is very challenging I would say it these are extremely challenging experiment agreed and we've made measurements and adult studies say it's those and so it might be the case that we knock out the transcription factor and the lc3 doesn't even differentiate into an i lc3 and so yeah their fingers cross these will work but i think it's important to have experimental validation of the method some of the cell types so ILC tubes can survive a bit in tissue culture and so on this is not our only means but we were hoping to do some functional validation we actually have some interesting gene targets in the ILC threes that we know are involved in for example i'll c3 th17 interaction so we have some interesting hypotheses about what kind of physiological effects will have sparsity in your interaction networks um and i guess i can i can see how that assumption might be valid but it's seems like it's a specially valid if you include any environmental parameters that may be controlling multiple nodes in your network so do you do you ever do that you include environmental parameters as well in these networks that would be something that should be done currently we've just been working with cross-sectional data and we haven't been we haven't been accounting for environmental factors but those would be very important measurements include sort of related to that question with the Mike microbial networks so and I'm never sure how to deal with this some people make this hypothesis that there are keystone species and microbial consortia one would assume that those have a higher degree of connectivity than the other would your models be sensitive to that or do they provide based on the data sets you have evidence that perhaps there aren't these highly connected nodes in other words the sort of a lack of this idea of a keystone species my collaborators Christian and back have gone on to apply to be easy to pretty much every microbial dataset under the Sun on looking at soil samples looking at different body sites and so they've come up with they say that the networks are sticky or a small world and so they do have some hug also just as a side note I on one of the things that really surprised me in the benchmarking of speakeasy is that the topology of the network actually has huge implications for how easy it is to infer the network so it's basically the number of samples you need in a theoretical setting we saw this empirically we browsed the high dimensional statistics literature and what we saw was that the number of samples that was required to recover a network that was actually generated from a multivariate Gaussian so so very nice network was actually directly dependent on the max degree in the network so this suggests that networks that do have hubs for example a scale-free network are a lot harder to infer than say on a random network or network that is cluster based where every node is limited to being connected like five other nodes so max degree does affect answerability thanks so much [Applause] [Music]
