so so just for those of you who've not been here before this is the tools and technology seminar series it is a venue to discuss new tools technologies and methodologies that are currently in development recently developed or just of interest to researchers if anyone's interested and give you a presentation either in late May or for the fall please let me know and today I'm pleased to present David shultiess who is going to talk to us about their design should I kill the lights leave a mark okay all right so I work at the Zhang lab and I'm based primarily up at the North Campus research community research campus from building 520 so it's great to see some of my five twenty guys up here today I'm going to be talking about protein design but this is intimately related to or tied to the process of protein folding so the Zhang group has two goals want us to predict the structure and function of macromolecules to aid an understanding sequence the structure and function relationships and the others to to clip that around the design maka molecules with altered modified augment or novel functionality or therapeutics diagnostics research tools and improved understanding a protein folding in general so most of you are of course maybe more related to looking at a lot of DNA structure a lot of DNA sequences maybe chromatin structure and what have you but sooner or later your field is going to be inundated with genomic information and when that occurs you are going to do a lot of analysis and looking at genes and where they're sitting in these chromosomes and what have you and then you're going to reach this point in which your informational you know ability to extract information from that DNA is going to come to the limitation and that is primarily because we like to think that most of the biological phenomenon in the cell occurs due to proteins and that proteins are really the mastermind of driving cellular metabolic processes if that's the case then your ability to predict protein function should then extend your ability to understand physiological phenomenon and regarding to human disease and treatment thereof so if you can use functional analysis of the human genome to predict what's going to happen in this cell this will push your ability to associate genetic code with a physiological phenomenon much greater and that day is you know some coming Bob lines or Rob lines up at the NCR at the NCRC has told me that they've actually moved their their genomic data recording a hardware from central campus to north campus because they're recording so much data the data transfer rates are now so high that they're now moving everything by hard drive so that day is coming and you guys gonna be awash in genomic information so understanding the processes of protein folding will help you extend your your genomic analysis so I'd like to kind of cap off that by talking about Christian and FinCEN's statement from his Nobel speech in 72 that the three-dimensional structure of a native protein in its normal logical Malou is one in which the Gibbs free energy of the system is the lowest and for those of you don't know our department chair or associate chair Gilman actually worked with Christian fencin in his younger years very important phenomenon the protein folding problem is a very complex we have a simple DNA sequence here and this is converted in RNA the protein is then translated by the the RNA is and converted into amino acid sequence by the ribosome and then the sequence is gonna undergo a unfolding process a falling process that gives you incredible functionality based on this very very unique architecture coupled with sequence specificity and if it weren't for this incredible diversity you wouldn't have the wonderful ability to do all the metabolic processes in your body so this we like to think of Tom Stites Hulu sedated the structure of the ribosome said you can't have function without structure and by that who's referring to the really complex and diverse functional phenomenon that occur because the unique shapes the proteins undertake the problem with this is that in terms of a a peptide this can take an enormous amount of confirmations and it can go undergo extreme variation in sequence but if the protein folding process is driven by and Vincents thermodynamic hypothesis and there's been no indication that that's not the case then we can think of structural modeling and protein design as really the same process but from different sides of the coin so we can take a primary sequence such as the one shown above and predicted structure by using the iterative threading assembly refinement algorithm from Yang's lab or we turn around and take a structure scaffold or a desired function and then turn on and design a sequence and really these two processes are governed by the same underlying principles again the real problem is that sequence variation is so large that sequence space is large it varies as 20 the N where n is the number of amino acids in the polypeptide chain so very quickly the problem gets out of hand computationally this is the I taser structural modeling package from Zhang's group it's one the critical assessment of structure prediction competitions over the last decade and it works basically like this you take a primary sequence you run a an algorithm that looks for similar structures and sequences by process called threading from this you get a series of templates out of this library or out of this search and then this these templates are excised into fragments and these are used as a series of restraints do structural assembly there's about 15 I think different terms and I taser that are used to drive the structural assembly process besides the restraints and then we do a process called clustering so clustering is really looking at the structural similarity between the various structures that were computationally derived and if there's not a large if there's not close similarity then in terms of hyperspace these structures will be I'm very dissimilar and they would be shown as kind of points in here and here in hyperspace but if the structures assembled they'll be kind of clustered together and we can use this to help drive what is the most likely the most probable structure or the structure with the highest probability of being as close to wild-type or native as possible so this is called the cluster centrally so these are then re these are used to drive new restraints put through the structure reassembly process and out of this we do some refinement and get to a final model yang also came up with a nice way of looking at structural differences between proteins by looking at this TM score this is a little bit different than the root-mean-square deviation that you guys are used to seeing in that because you have this di over do where do is a specific constant it tends to down weight amino acids that are in dissimilar positions using a C alpha trace so if you have two different proteins that have the similar fold but maybe the end terminus is beginning of the proteins are wildly different then this program will this function will down weight the large differences and really focus on the residues of the protein for structural similarity score that are close together so it's nice for looking at proteins where the fold between the two are similar but you have certain fragments of the proteins which are highly dissimilar this is an accurate eye teaser model that was generated in the cast nine competition from Vibrio para holly tiss it was solved by the north-eastern structural genomics consortium give you an idea on the ability to predict structures so these are blind tests and know what it's gonna look like they don't know what the actual structure looks like until they finish the contest down all right so if we do structure prediction which is shown up here we can also flip that around and do protein design so we're gonna think it talked about now for the rest of the talk will be focused on designing proteins this is a Servat probably Mitra and I worked on this is the website that you can access by this and these are the two papers related to this and then hopefully I'll be talking about some work that's under review right now on the biofilter so the protein design autumn is a hybrid method it's composed of both physical and statistical or knowledge-based potentials some would say evolutionary this is the first to use a structure based protein sequence profile on the Montecarlo simulation as the first is we know that also incorporates secondary structure torsion angle and solvent accessibility parameters in the Montecarlo simulation it also uses sequence based clustering techniques for a final sequence selection so a lot of what we learned from protein structure prediction with a tazer we're now basically flipping around and we're using in the design algorithm so the design algorithm can be thought of as it having three basic parts first we're going to generate a protein profile construction which is so much like protein threading oh then we're gonna do randomization a simulation amount of Carlos search simulation and then we're gonna do a final sequence selection via clustering how this basically works is we input a target structure such as the x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis birth three domains shown here with a cognate binding peptide and we do a search through the PDB library for similar structures so let's say we come up with I don't know 15 20 different structures using Tamlyn and then we look at these structures and they're sequenced relationship and we drive essentially a sequence profile which is an L by 20 matrix that relates the similarity between the different structures what this gives you essentially amino acid probabilities as each position the profile at first is not continuous so to make it continuous ie we get we can use any of the residues we actually blur this profile we're using a blosum62 matrix derived from Steven Hana costs work in the mid-1990s to make this continuous so if you have a tyrosine in the in the profile you can look at phenylalanine as well because we have a blosum62 matrix to deal with that so we drive the sequence profile and then we're gonna use this in the Monte Carlo simulation so the Montecarlo simulation works like this we start with a random sequence and then interval e wearit 8 we do a series of random mutations to the sequence and then we score the sequence and we have two potentials in this scoring potential one is evolutionary based and the other is physical based the evolutionary potential has the multiple sequence alignment the sequence profile it's also conserved of single sequence secondary structure predictions or profiles or potentials some accessibility and torsion angles we add to this a physical potential currently using a program called fold X in which we look at the difference between the unfolded and folded States and drive a energy score there we didn't take Z scores for each one of these scores and which are derived and by comparison with basically random sequences and random folds and we drive a total score which is a Montecarlo energy and what we do is we look at the difference between let's say sequence n and sequence n minus 1 so we'll always accept into our final sequence stack if the difference between the the sequence n and the last sequence is lower and then there's also a probability based on this distribution of e to the Delta e over KT if it's actually less favorable and this allows us to bounce the sequence out of unfavorable trajectories so you have to incorporate this if you don't want to get stuck very quickly in a local minimum and last what we do is we take the 300,000 sequences from ten in two minute ten independent trajectories and we cluster them using the blosum62 matrix and this is done with a clustering 40% of the sequences so once we have that then we basically I go to my desk and I convert the protein to a gene and then I send the gene to a commercial fee-for-service vendor to have it synthesized and then I'm going to incorporate that gene into an expression plow and sticking a coal and we're gonna make the protein so this now we can talk about actually taking the algorithm and actually using it to secrete things so on Phase one hopefully I'll get to phase 1 and phase 2 and our talk today I'm just talking about designing single protein domains not with protein-protein interaction partners not with a enzymatic function just designing single protein domains so work with nine protein domains to start and we're talking about the initial biophysical characterization of these so how we did this is we had our protein of interest our design gene here and then we fuse this for expression e.coli with a series of elements one is an affinity purification tag that's six histidine amino acids in a row another is a solubility domain the monomeric OCR domain and then last is a tobacco age of iris prettiest cut site if this allows us to purify our protein this helps give this protein domain time to fold if this protein is folded it'll give this time a chance to escape from small kinetic traps to get into and this allows us to separate all this stuff from this later on so basically you purify this entire element and then you separate this element from all of this by adding a protease which cuts in this region what we found was that seven of our nine designs were soluble when we couldn't cut the solubility tag off one we couldn't separate out the molar solubility tag two didn't express and five were subjective off its characterization we found of those that three of the nine were well fold and it's stable and I'm going to show you some of the experimental evidence we have to support that so this is a SDS stain Komachi stay in SDS gel sds-page gel it's essentially for I don't know four or five centimeters on the side and the thin axis is about a millimeter what we do is we load our protein samples up here and then we run voltage over the gel and then they they basically the proteins basically run down this way based on amino acid length or a protein mass here we have our molecular weight marker on the Left which is in kilo daltons and here we have our purified proteins these are after gel filtration so these are highly polished and these are with the fusion tag on and you can see that we're getting a fairly high purity right now it's probably greater than 95 percent which is good enough for most the biophysical characterization techniques we're going to use so this is very satisfactory we cut the tag off we remove this stuff and then we just work with the shorter genes so of the five sequences that we could work with one was from a test set from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and shown here in purple and these are for other domains that we worked with these are the PD B's of the target scaffolds that we worked with these two lengths they range from basically 68 amino acids all the way up to 146 this is the sequence identity between the design fold and the native that we use is the target this is the type of fold whether it's all beta strand whether it's alpha beta whether it's alpha helix long alpha beta or beta these are the predicted structures versus the wild-type by taser given an rmsd and this is whether the proteins were expressed soluble they had secondary structure ie out for beta beta strands and then this is whether they had a stable 3-dimensional fold around a flavin cofactor that's a really good point so because we have you folded on the right right so because of the I will show you what the effect of the structure profile is and so in regions that are very well conserved for that structure profile is gonna really drive those amino acid sequences of that region so you know you will I'll show you the statistics on that a second so you'll see the impact of that and for the right right this is I will I will show you data that that pushes that on but that could be a real possibility so ligand bounding and dimerization is definitely a kind of an area or multi domain proteins is kind of a next step for us for sure very good question these are the five predicted folds by a tazer and here each one of the the protein names and these are circular dichroism spectra for those protein so here you have the wavelength in nanometers of the incident light and this is the mean residue ellipticity so what you're doing here is you're taking your protein sample really low concentration and you're sticking in a cuvette and then you're illuminating it with left and right handed circular eyes polarized light so everyone familiar with how that's created it's a really amazing phenomenon and the protein dude what's fold will it basically absorb the two different circularized light forms of light and you'll get a very interesting different spectrum and so the mean residue lip tissa t basically gives you a profile of this difference in absorption so for a random polypeptide in solution that doesn't have alpha helical or beta strand alpha helixes or beta strands in it you'll see a value that's prior very close to zero but as it begins to adopt a secondary fold a fold with alpha HeLa C is a beta strands you'll start to see these secondary structure elements come out this doesn't mean that the protein is stable it just means that it has secondary structure elements in it and what you can see is that at around 220 between basically 205 and 222 you have these strong negative ellipticity values which are indicative of secondary structure of interest is the thio dachshund fold which turns out to be identical to wild-type so even though the sequence identity is around 35% the fold by CD looks essentially identical and it was really nice seeing this because I could look through the published literature and see CD spectra from a thyroid oxen domain so with that in mind we have some idea of secondary structure in the protein now we can move forward using nuclear magnetic resonance mag reg and mag mag ret magnetic residents to ascertain the the protein fold this is a simple 1d shot by NMR of proton spectrum and it's basically cut between ppm of 7 and 0.5 we're just going to focus on the region the spectra associated with my proton and the spectrum frequency that is in the range of the methyl chemical frequency or the chemical shifts if you will so we're interested in two features one is that if you look between F and G you'll see that the feature space and they my proton chemical shift range is very very kind of bland for for the are NPK but it's very very unique for the thyroid auxin and essentially magnetic resonance spectroscopy works on this process of electronic shielding and if the individual electronic environment around each of my proton is very unique and seems to be consistent with on the time scale of the NMR phenomenon you'll get these very unique features here and whereas here these spectra need to be very very sharp which indicates that the my proton is flopping around in solution or they can be very very broad or not seen at all if it's working on a conformational exchange or in mobility that's on the time frame of the NMR spectrum here the methyl chemical shifts and these methyl chemical shifts come from basically faylene isoleucine residues where the methyl groups for the side chains are well buried they experience a electronic environment that is very strong and it shields the proton electrons for that particular nuclei greatly so they experience a lower NMR magnetic field strength and thus they have this frequency range that shows up here in terms of parts from millions or chemical shifts so we see that G H and J have these unique features and we come to conclusion that these proteins are well folded well as these are moderately folded there is some some structure there but it's it's not these are not stable domains so we use to use two experiments to look at the secondary structure using C D and then we look at the fold of the protein bye bye anymore so then with that in mind we worked with a thyroid auxin domain and the cytokine independent survival Fox homology main we're able to get crystals of this domain a biochemical rotation student Greg dodge came in and crystallized our Fox homology demand this P X domain and they got crystals here in this condition sodium acetate pH 400 mil more sodium phosphate 30% peg 2000 and here and the longest length is about 3 to 400 micrometers and on the short axis they're about 50 or so micrometer these are very very small and you can't really see them by eye and you need at least like a 10 to 100 pound my power microscope to see them so we took these crystals to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs synchrotron and we illuminated them with one angstrom essentially one angstrom light if you take a protein crystal and you put it in and this beam of light that you get about I think 10 to the 13 photons per second you can get a diffraction pattern and this is essentially a charge coupled device it's a plate we put the protein crystal in front of the beam the beam is a beam of light is non divergent meaning it's kind of like light from the Sun and comes through a narrow slit not 1/100 of a square millimeter and this light impinges on the crystal and then the atoms within the crystal all resonate electric elastically and you get constructive interference patterns these interference patterns show up at these little reflections which are called Bragg reflections the angle between the center right here and the going outwards gives you an idea of the resolution of information that is in the data set this beam coming across right here is simply a beam stop that keeps the the synchrotron light source from destroying the detector this ring right here is a water shell that represents about 3 angstrom resolution so as you go out here this gives you increasing information content these are a series of three dimensional waves that you add up to form an electron density map in a box you can think of this as a shoebox right in each one of these spots represents a three-dimensional wave and this is the magnitude of the wave the problem is is that it doesn't give you the phasing information in that wave so we know that a wave has frequency it has an amplitude and then it's gonna have some phase information the problem is x-ray crystallography does not give it currently using this technique it's not give us the phase information we rotate the crystal through basically 1-degree oscillations you collect around 300 data frames and you determine the basically box that the protein sits in which is known as the unit cell which then derives like the cemetery operations that allow us to basically reconstruct a protein within that box based on the space group assignment which is known as a primitive orthorhombic space group and this tells us that there are basically four molecules within this unit cell there's about a trillion molecules of the protein within these small protein crystals which is an amazing number right a trillion proteins are used to form the crystal that led to this diffraction pattern the reason we use protein crystals for this is that the crystals amplify the signal now people are starting to use free electron light sources to basically vaporize proteins and get single molecule scattering patterns but this is currently the old-school traditional way of collecting structural information using short wavelengths of light so this is our statistics behind our data collection set these are the actual unit cell parameters this is the basic box it makes up the information that we use to do to model our protein in and this is the resolution range we collect probably around 70 or 80 thousand of those spots we call Bragg reflections and then we work this down to about twelve thousand reflections by noting that many of the reflections are redundant they're the same data set we split this into a working set and kind of a test set just like you do all your computational information training we look at the completeness of the set versus the possible set size and we look at some multiplicity and signal-to-noise and there's some other data that may be of interest other structural biologists overall when we refine the structure we found that the favored regions for the Ramachandran plot the dihedral torsion angles is quite good and there are a few and the allowable regions and they have to do with some loops that we had difficulties modeling but overall this is a very good dataset it's complete and is high signal-to-noise so these were the very first electron density map shown on the right I fitted the basic C alpha model to give you an idea of how the Gila C's sit in this protein we developed this phasing solution using molecular placement and the original model we use the original Fox homology domain model to derive our phazon information that we don't get from extra truthful graphic experiment we have some statistics to tell us whether that's correct or not we knew that this was a very good solution right away here you're looking in blue is your electron density this comes due to the scattering of the electrons associate with the atoms right here you can see amino acid chain the sidechain this is most like a finality and then you hear you have a little bit of the backbone and another helix nearby so the green elements represent difference that isn't accounted for in my structure model and the red indicate regions that the algorithm is telling me they shouldn't be there and then we have a ways of controlling the signal-to-noise so you can make this much stronger a weak or depending on your your cutoff you can filter that out so we built this model and after refinement this is the electron density we see around phenylalanine 45 you can very clearly see the aromatic ring structure and down here and very very low you can actually start to see the middle of the ring structure so that that the electron density actually is a very weak there so now we'll move to more structural analysis we're going to compare our designed x-ray structure are designed to main x-ray structure with the wild type so the design is always going to be in blue and the native is in in green and what you see it is how it has I think three strands and four alpha helixes with a number of loops there is also this sulfate and on that was bound in the crystal structure it turns out to be quite interesting where that's located these loops down here were hard to model electron density is very poor there so I just like to point that out that this is a very very poor fit but these happen to do with a large number of positively charged residues this is the match between in blue the x-ray crystallographic structure of our design domain and the I taser structure I've kept the sulfate molecule in for the designed emitting and the x-ray structure but I taser does not have that but because it's using a threading based template model and we're in real mode it has a high chance of predicting the structure because we've used a structure profile in the design simulation so many of the features that I teaser recognizes in terms not just of the threading templates but all so the statistical potentials show up really well so I taser is actually able to fit this structure well at about one point three two angstroms difference rmsd between the this is the design x-ray structure and the I taser model overheated questions so so what does this domain do David what's what's the role of the cytokine independent survival kinase fox homology domain and this px domain is actually fused to the cytokine independent kinase domain and it's involved in localizing the kinase domain at the membrane remember it has a structure profile which is helping drive certain key features of the protein fold in the design simulation it also turns out that profile is also driving amino acids that will be associated with membrane Association so this domain fuses likes to bind its a peripheral membrane protein and it likes to bind to lysosomal compartment phospho naso tides and their specific phospho naso ties that this designed are the protein likes to bind to it turns out because the structure profile used there's high similarity in this in fact the sulfate molecule binds in a similar way that the phospho nasi tide does in a similar box homology domain structure I will show you in just a second so this is the this is the sequence alignment between the wild-type and the design structure where the strands represented as arrows and the Gila sees as ovals and the purple represents sequence identity 100% so to get back to your issue is how does the how does the structure profile work with designed and domain and what's its impact we can look at a at a Shannon entropy map Claude e Shannon came out of here at the University of Michigan and then he went to MIT and he's in one of the considered the father of information theory right you guys remember that at all yeah so he came up with this idea of entropy and he was talking to another physicist and he was like oh you should look at this guy Gibbs as entropy and so he used that model to describe his own variation of entropy and so he came up with Shannon entropy and this reports on the log probabilities for each amino acid at each position and dark red indicates low entropy I eat very well conserved and then dark blue represents high entropy and not really conserved down at the bottom is the summation the total entropy for that position and you see that in both the wild type and the design where they're strong and tropic the entropy is quite high the the the match is quite good and where the entropy is low the match is quite good particularly if you look here in these red segments here you notice that the off in some cases the sequence conservation is more kept with the design than the the wild type and so there's a sulphate that I've spoken about for the design that shows up in the crystal structure and it binds to these residues shown right here and you can see this in this structure below the residues involved in the that are very well conserved in this map show up here in red and so these residues really help drive the fold and thus the function of the protein so this has the tendency of gaming us a warm-up for a given function we're gonna have a greater probability of being successful I believe in our design simulations if we have this structure profile with us because Mother Nature has already mapped a space out so we can use this for our design in the future if we want to design a protein that binds of specific fossil and also tied for use in in vivo assays for research their Diagnostics or therapeutics sometime in the future so one of the interesting things is so if the structural profile is going to you know look at the entire fold space for all these Fox homology domains what's the impact on it so here in green you can see this loop from the wild-type design protein and this is another structure of another wild-type another native Fox homology demand and there's a prole in here and this prolene shows up on our design as well and this prolene really restricts the motion of this this portion or sequence of the amino acid chain and so you get this angle of the the design domain that follows more closely this this other Fox homology demand that was not the target template and this is important because even though the there's a variation in this region a lot of the statistical potentials or help drive in the amino acid selection so that it doesn't get to off too far off the beaten path for instance if this part of the protein only bound to another part of the protein up here in green and suddenly put this prolene in here well maybe the whole thing is not going to work that well and so by using the statistical potentials there may be some features that are encapsulated into the sequence selection region here that are you know that that help out the general process ie what I mean by this is that a physical base potential as soon as you vary the the structure right you have to account for that and you know that's gonna be next to impossible using standard physical based potentials because you've actually fit this this model to here so it's not going to sample that and you can't set up all these different con formers for every amino acid change you're going to do in a design simulation so we do three hundred cycles for this one fixed structure and if you start moving that structure around it means you have to do for every move you still have to do those you know all those mutations so it gets really really hard so here I think is a benefit of the structure profile and the bottom line is I think it basically keeps you on track so on here is this p40 fox homology domain with a phospho naso tied analogue bound in the x-ray crystallographic structure I have taken that phospho Nauset ID and by superposition put it in this region where the phosphate anion is sitting in our crystal structure and the the likeness is very very high there's no specific clashes and the rmsd between the two phosphate groups between the crystal structure is shown here and here turns out to be less than an angstrom so they sit very very similar if you look at the residues here you have arginine 58 arginine 41 histidine 38 histidine 22 these residues well conserve the structure profile so they show up in the protein what you notice though is the binding pocket is a little bit smaller here it's larger here these are differences that are not conserved between individual domains so we still have room to you know we can drive let's say if we want to make a binding profile and incorporate it in a design engine we still mutate this around and still keep the possibility of binding a phosphoenol so tight but have different features we did not measure the binding of this phosphate off this phosphoenol site ID to the did the design domain so how did the we do a kind of a we step back and we look at all the secondary structure solving accessibility and rotamer errors in the design and comparison city the wild type domains we can kind of look at maybe the impact that these potentials had in our design simulation so up here we have a secondary structure given by Yanks PSS pred and in blue is the the wild-type protein where one is a perfect match and zero is an air and then in red we have the design sequence and it works out to the accuracy by psi spread for the designs simulation is 91% and for wild-type is 86% if we go back and we reanalyze this by emo design the difference is definitely skewed so Evo design is recognizing design sequence with a statistically significant difference as well as when we look at the solvent accessibility so we predict the salm accessibility for each residue and we see that in general the solvent which is another program that yang wrote as minimal differences but Evo design definitely recognizes the difference and so you're definitely skewing the outcome in favor of amino acids that the e blow design secondary structure potential and some accessibility potentials recognize if we look at the rotary air this is very unique because we're using the the sidechain fitting program squirrel illness this difference is definitely significant and it's about a 10 degree a different spread so you're just predicting the angles for the sidechain row tumors so everyone all we know that each of the potentials in regard to ebook design is definitely recognizable and these are helping guide the the selection of amino acid sequence that has a larger or we think more likely probability of actually working so to wrap up would just say that we've designed a molecule with atomic accuracy and then we'd be able to predict that structure with a tazer so that's our kind of our first our phase and now we're going to switch to designing functional proteins we have probably about 10 more minutes so I'll just kind of get into a little bit of the background behind this and then we can I'll get to the data that we can we do have some of the data so we're just in designing starting designed functional proteins now we're gonna focus on protein peptide interactions and here we have a map of the basic biochemical pathways associated with cancer we're gonna focus on this protein called x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis specifically a BER three domain within this the BER 3 domain is known to inhibit Smacks some Mac proteins and inhibits caspase-9 so this protein called smack arse mad binds to caspase-9 and basically excuse me the smacker SMAT will bind to xip and it will block the xip caspase-9 interaction when caspase-9 is free it's normal activity is to start the process of apoptosis there are other controlling factors involved but this is this is one of them and so we decided to design an xip BER 3 domain that would bind a smack we can use that as a research reagent in cell based studies we're actually trying to incorporate these functionally designed proteins into in vivo of cells and a breast cancer cell line to see if we can perturb the system so this is kind of a important work that really hasn't been I think examined much by the protein design field which is when you stick these design domains back in the and a protein in the cell what do they do and I kind of liken this problem of of you'd like to be able to perturb the system in a way where you still have let's say one design function ie you design the xip to bind this mad and and that would basically keep this wild-type caspase-9 function intact so you're not causing a cell to die and so you could use that in the presence of compounds that actually drive the cell de apoptosis and you could tease out various biochemical pathways by by the incorporation or dition of these design de Maynes and what's nice about this is that they may be silent in the cell ie their outside surface may be completely different to a large tree other than that lets say the functional binding epitope so they may not be inhibited at at the RNA level they may not be inhibited at the gene silencing level and so you have a ways of kind of overcoming this in ways that the normal cell is is not going to respond because it doesn't think that you're putting in an ex IP domain in terms of biochemical feedback loops that may have an advantage later on so we're trying to look at that the idea is you basically target biochemical pathways that are interacting drug discovery ie that are in phase one phase two trials and and help ascertain you know what's going on so these were not only just the xip structure but we're also targeting other proteins associated with this we've been successful in designing xip domains and also as well as PD Zeno mains I'm just going to talk about the ex IP domain with the smads Mac peptide so xip the birth three domain binds the in terminus of this protein called smack arse mad and it does so at a dimer and when it does the normal inhibition of xip of caspase-9 is blocked so what you have is smack which is released from basically dying mitochondria is going to bind competitively with xip and it's gonna block this inhibition so a negative of negative gives you positive and this caspase-9 goes active and it turns on the programmed cell death pathway so that's what we're going to be targeting our design is our focus right now is to see if we can design XFP bur 3 domain so in blue is the wild-type structure and in red is the predicted structure by taser we had a designed interface and then we also kept the design we modulated the design but we kept the interface fixed for a protein which come on the fixed interface xip and we did this because of control because we really you know we had no idea of what the outcome was gonna be it turns out the outcome is good for both of the design proteins they both find the target peptide so here we have for the designed interface we have mutations in this interface that are different from a wild-type and there's about a 50% sequence variation from the design down here you have the secondary structure elements of the protein and you have the wild-type xip the fixed interface or the design x art piece this is where the peptide binds down here showing these black dots and this is where the caspase-9 interfaces the caspase-9 interface is much larger so first we did the same thing we did previously with our monomeric things we looked at the protein folds by circular dichroism here's your wavelength down here here's your mean residue ellipticity here and all three of the proteins have strong negative features these proteases though are very fold space is very very unique is very very strong here and i don't know how to analyze this other than to say that they do have some secondary structure elements in them that's very very unique we then took these proteins and put them in an NMR tube and collected the protein spectra and this is the full spectrum now that i'm showing you and we did see very very solid chemical shifts for each of routines for the my protons as well as some of the methyl groups that show up kind of down in this range right here so that was good we then looked at the free energies unfolding so we went back to the circular dichroism spectra but this time we added in a denaturant this is the denaturing composition using urea and molarity and this is the mean residue lip tissa t for a given wavelength I think we use like 2 22 23 years pretty high and what you can see is that the mean resolute isset e at 0 molar concentration is very low it gets sound very negative numbers and then as you add in the urea it starts to become very much more positive much like you have a free peptide in solution and from this we can determine a free energy unfolding which for a wild-type xcp was - 2.7 2.7 kcals per mole as well as the DI and then the FI is 2.3 kilo Cal per mole this difference between the DI and the fi is statistically significant there is no difference really between the fi and the di through statistics I don't know why right now the fi domain is not as stable as is the other two so we also in a collaboration with Tomic trapeze group in the Department of Pathology we we subject our protein to two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy here is the amide proton frequency range and we've also added an additional element of nitrogen spectra so we've isotopically labeled our protein this is a heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra or HS QC this unique feature map here is derived from the my nitrogen of my proton pairs and you get this whenever the protein is well folded so in red are the dots that Withers just the xip alone and then we titrate in a smack peptide which is the short end terminus that's a little responsible for driving caspase-9 inhibition and we titrate it in in green and then fully exhaustively to saturation in blue and we do that for the design interface as well as the fixed interface and what you can look at very specifically if we look here over in the for the fixed the the fixed interface you can clearly see that in the smack with no smacking here you get this red peak here then you add in a little bit of the smack basically half basically one to two smack to xip and you get kind of green here and kind of green here and then when you saturate xip with smack you get this blue dot here so this is telling us that the electronic environment around xip is changing because the smack peptide is binding the protein and this is true for both the by design and the fixed interface so then we we subject the protein to isothermal calorimetry with the addition of this Mack peptide and we found out the dissociation constants for the wild type as a control comparison was a Nenana molar the DI xip was one hundred sixty seven animal has large much larger variance and the FI sample was 273 kind of going along with the difference in stability that we saw from the unfolding experiments and this is kind of the best example we had of our di xip binding isotherm that's been derived from isothermal calorimetry so this tells us that the peptide is binding the protein and the affinities between the two are roughly are very close to being next to native so they also looked at all right so you've designed an interface that binds smack well what about you know binding caspase-9 and inhibiting caspase-9 function so shaman Wong's group has a very nice experiment where they can look at the prettiest activity of caspase-9 in the presence of xip and you can add in compounds that inhibit xip for their assay or we can just compare the wild-type versus the fixed interface and design interface if the fixed interface or design interface don't interact with caspase-9 we should expect full activity however if wild-type xip interacts with caspase-9 we should see a definite loss in Proteus activity and what you see in terms of fluorescence scales that indeed the types you add in more of the protein you get less pretty-like activity at caspase-9 whereas the DI and the fi samples are unchanged if you look at this as a percentage of inhibition of caspase-9 activity here's your basic plot there's a very strong difference between tool so we've designed the proteins to bind the SMAC peptide but because of the differentiation between various caspase-9 structures and the large surface area of the caspase-9 xip / 3 domain interaction this doesn't carry over so we were able to get crystals of the fixed interface to xip with collaboration with lee lab with bing bing one and they've now moved back to China but they weren't able to get a structure on this I looked at some of the electron diffraction patterns and we've tried processing the data and we really couldn't work with this too much which is unfortunate and with that I think we can probably because we're running short on time I'm just going to stop right there and say that we're currently I'm currently developing a method to use mass spectroscopy to look at the fold of the protein and there's some several people working out with that so with that I'll just kind of close up and I'd say that these are all the wonderful folks that have helped us out I'd like to thank the DCM be particularly Brian a Theni and Gilman for all the start-up money and the NCR space and financial support from my own stay here at the University of Michigan yang Zhang he's where he has several NIH and NSF fellowships he's been wonderfully supportive and all these people here I've been helping me out in various ways associated with both of these projects and then the Europe program has been very supportive of me I've worked with over 4200 graduate students we received for undergraduate Europe fellowships and then these are a list of our collaborators additionally Loras esse from Jason just wiki's lab Jason's now moved the UCSF but I'm still working with Laura and she's trying to incorporate our design proteins into a breast cancer cell line so that we can look at how the xip domains can be used to perturb the biochemical pathways for for apoptosis relative to compounds that the shaman Wang lab group has for are used for cancer therapies thank you so much I hope that I kept everyone awake and and everything else there's any questions okay okay I will so I did question early online the simulation part of your design when you're introduced mutations I first of all I take it that's a fairly compensation intensive thing to do or is it it is I was just curious you'd mentioned shortly after that that you in various times that you're finding proteins where the fold looks very similar to the wild-type but the sequence conservation is not really all that strong so I'm assuming that means that they're parts of the sequence that matter more to the fold in the sense than the rest you use that to inform which mutations you can do to introduce where or do to sort of do it at random let the method do what it does I think it's important what you can do is you're talking about being smart and the way introduce mutations and I would I think that your idea is right one of things and I think we've actually implemented this now is that you make you can look at the phone to the protein and say this is a buried region this is a song accessible and you know what those amino acids are what they should be statistically so you can incorporate those but if you start doing more than that you start really driving the system in ways that maybe you don't want to go so I think you can do a limited version of smart amino acid selection maybe that can be driven you could use the probabilities from this map to help drive that but you have to be careful that you really don't limit your search too much so you know where we like to go with this kind of big picture we'd like to start designing protein protein interactions and start designing antibodies and then using these to aid in crystallization using them for basically therapeutics you can design proteins with very very high melting temperatures that you can you know take out in the field in Africa and I a say certain things for they get very very high you know very long shelf lives we could even potentially incorporate synthetic amino acids into our design algorithm so right now this is this this whole program is basically designed this basic engine can you make an engine can it more or less work and then over time you will then fill in you know add different features to the design work engine so far it seems to work but not all the time I mean overall so by scoring probably work this out and and he looked at using the feed out is really I Taser so you basically fit this scoring potential and you look at how I Taser thinks about some of these sequences you've really hit upon a really big problem it's just how do you train your algorithm right how do you weight the scoring functions and and this we have very very limited data on this and this is actually since I've been in the design lab one of the things I really want to think I realize is that the most important thing we can get is very very large data sets where we understand the impact of mutations and insertions and deletions on that that protein and then you can use this information in your bio informatics programs to do what to help improve your functional annotation of the human genome right so this basic work and the problem you hit on is one that you can use not only in protein design but in protein structure prediction and thus human genomic you know functional annotation of the human genome [Applause]
