says it's a classic it started so most of you signed in if you do it to do so it just helps justify the people oh he's being counted back here I'll bring the Cheyenne sheet to the backs of anyone did it sign anything from over a point um we do have people watching online during these days so if you asked any questions if you try to speak loudly particularly reporter sitting on the for free I think that room mics in the middle and don't always pick up very well so just remember to speak out that you romeo something out so today's speaker is is a postdoc in d c-- NB and thank you for the introduction today I really introduce our recently developed they are called sanitizer with trifle folding proteins by both contact the information and thus writing completely information here is the outline of my talk first I will introduce some background of protein folding problem then I will introduce the methodology of the settlor pipeline insured or some result here is the protein or structure prediction problem protein primer as structure is the linear sequence of amino acid which normally are shown by alphabet or screen and the local fragment of the primal sequence or the subsidy of this of this sequence perform some special pattern for example this beta strain and alpha helix in the 3d dimension oh this coated or secondary structure of the protein and etre and here shape of the protein in 3d are dimensions based out of the nursery as the doctor of the protein inspector order the protein structure is a very important key to study the protein function actually is very time-consuming or expensive to solve the protein structure by III mental test so many computer software had help in developers to predict that or proteins 3d structure from the frame rails even a primary sequence basing on whether the complete piece are complete used or not the my silicon categories into two groups mine is called template based measures is called a free modeling method is feel or show this let's show the key idea of trading taste measure new diet complete based method of protein primer sequence primer sequence are also called query sequence first deduction Fewster teachers will be pre picked by the machine learning method artist as the doctor periods included a second release the doctor and so on then the query sequence together with this predicts that the doctor futures will be a search against all the PDB library which include or all the third are instrumental structure then it will open to the best match which also called complete for this query cracking then each amino acid in all residue Alfred residue in this query our sequence will align to the residue in complex the doctrine then according to co-author coordinate of the residue in pamphlet will be copied to the query amino accurate also predict called coordinate or for this residue instant are in some reason there were some tab aligned up between pamphlet and the query sequence or incomplete based method if we were using the for loop for this or that reason then in the next or retirement step this two-part will be linked together and remove the clash and so on then you will catch the final model like this - them as they were very popular youth under it tastes nicer for example at hazard low mates and a cheat free or from tease or peplum we can see the complete quality I can't decide through a template based on modeling mobile quality so if you can't pick up through cracks template for your purse equals all the templates put the template not existing in the PDB library or generally you will the complete this method will field for the doctoral modeling to address this problem people develop the free modeling method also called a be nationwide method in aviation method they won't go to the protein France to Brok without any information from the template so they will build the initial confirmation with some random random loop then are floating this protein along with this free energy to face to catch the minimal value then you will get a predict model here the free energy can be either knowledge-based and show all physical piece angel or doto mostly a go there several popular used a V initial Messer for example clock and the Rossiter are developed by David Baker motivation are they developed a baby initial matter method Israel to it we run our boat without any information from pamphlet but till tutorial free energy is not still accurate actually feel free modeling measured all 18-nation method really not good as with the template based method till through the distal problem but since had been changed after four concept that called residue contact has been introduced a coutore teenager modeling method this feature so the definition or the concept of the rescue contact pure protein or proteins release the doctrine into the CP parties to theta autumn distance Buddhist residue I and the rest to T is less than a ton strong then is to rescue from or residual contact and actually if we labored is protein residue from 1 to L parameter and protein and communal to C terminal then we can using or else graph might our matrix who are describe the protein residue contact information t-rex and right post our rescue index and the right flight point means the rescue contact and right point miss 9 rescue contact for example this point means rescue or 55 and the rescue 100 file from or contact then from this our detonation we can see a create or contact information is not useful for the protein folding problem because you must note 3d dimensions the doctor then know the content map so LSU can catch this compare map from protein sequence this feature is not useful for the the doctor prediction in recently research people found this later rescue which films contact have some spatial relationship in the protein evolution this racial evolution called coevolution which means they found the residue we which filmed contact they usually muted together and it is call you Lucien can be observed in the neutral sequence alignment of food is query protein so after people really notice this feature can use predicted or contact list you contact a federal marshal in new measures have been developed for predict the contact information from the protein primer primary sequence after this race to contact become predictable this information has been shown very useful for pretty protein the dr. prediction for example or if we can predict this to raise your front contact from this protein severs entering the proteins stimulation we can port is to rescue closed data to format or compact in this but if this compact wrist wrist print is very directly information to help you put the protein structure and the this figure show the comparison with the a B initial Messer without contact the information we show the puppy our result and the template based modeling measured at hazard and the AP initial measured mates the contactor at additional risk dreams here lies the gemstone which is a measurable quality your model of qualify your model health quality and deter to have the higher chance can score means you have a better model so from this figure we can see with results or additional contact information a B initial measured part actually not good as with the template based measure and but after we introduce the contact the information through crack then the seatback it much tighter it into a complete this measure at hazard to this proof the contact information is actually very useful for the protein-protein problem we think whether we can introduce this contact recipient to the template based method to relieve or improve the performance of a teaser so don't show the key idea of why we want introduced to contact the information for the reporting program director working surface so we can first the using threading for program to pick up the template for the ferry a protein-rich so in this figure the temp later showed either a blue color and is Raymond host doctor suing tech of our black color we can see the local for a fragment or the local structure that the template can fit well with the instrument of the culture but we can see the orientation of this Hilux is much deeper from this instrumental culture this week means your tablet is not good enough that's if they can predict the contact the information between this Hilux and it is pips brand from the sequence then during the putting simulation we can pull this helix to form the contact to close through this basis the brain to bring this create contact then you will get a final model which showing the red and the yellow color so this is the key idea that why we want introduce the contact with a complete based measure to implement this idea of a pewter a pipeline of to address are we showing this figure starting under query sequence we can first using the my toaster it's reading server colonies to pick up templates for next step in the same time we can using or MSA or multiple sequence alignment generation software at the TPMS a computer or most both sequence alignment for this query for him then this most whole sequence alignment will feed to a set of contact predictors to predate the door contact max then the information from this template and content maps can be used ok the folding simulation to catch through simple intercept a group confirmation or decrease our from the assimilation that requires all the confirmation from these simulations that and be used a sniper cluster based on under the cultural similarity then the cluster center of this largest class cluster will be selected as the initial de Christ initial model further refinements that a unity step a software called at VMP will implement through the initial model will be Moodle clash and editor selfie then you will get the final model international slides are you are some details of the status of pipeline in each content of each content of the third header the deep MSA is the google deepmind and free or is nothing else something are left oh there's no Google this is a fool grad versus this this is the competition there are no there's no no Google chunking no but like so just just for so dizzy is this the same cast competition that Google one who is upcoming well this is Google one one entry for the machine learning last year these guys want it for I know how seven air yes so then they won they won the other competition with a Taser and then quark last year keen learning birches they were second okay gotta get it out there I'll tell you why we got to get it out there because the press picks up on Google and they don't put the pick up from these guys okay and you know if we had 15,000 processors you know it might be a different story with Google that's part of the problem it's asymmetric warfare I will introduce some detail of the TPMS a pipeline or in the next slide this slide shooters are striving my sir the Union climate gene or set as a pipeline so this we noticed the singles ratings or singles rating measured will have some autumn on T and I saw this all for the Monte oh wait employment or might has writing measured which include include 11 tingles rating measured to 10 to the templates for sale a sir starting from the query sequence this sequence will pass to 11 individuals writing programs to stand the template from the library then you will get a set off or set off template from each individual's writing we were using low mists of Arirang this template and that is will block the template will be as the initial confirmation or photo next step stimulation step very couple questions here um have you been able to kind of feed there several this is fascinating good have you been able to figure out like when you run one protein versus another to the the success of the different programs think I mean you know is there one program of these eleven that's better than another all the time I mean at work uh I create a when they thank you mock the results in some protein this program may be better at least some other target this program may be better so that's why we are using the night um on make a measure to to combine third advantage of different singles rating my third it's like the one that's the adapt search is there a certain kind of protein where that works better you know like say a alpha barrel or you know some some template where that works better and you know then you have a beta sheet versus something where you have some flexible I mean is there been able to figure out which program works with what kind of structure better hmm it'd be interesting this that was one kind of questions another one is how do you manage that computationally so are there different processes that are going how does how does the workflow computationally mean is there does it take different amounts of computational power to run these different algorithms and then you collect the results run them independently and then you collect the results and then cool them I mean how's that work Araki magnoliids yeah so each one of these training programs if don't job on the supercomputer obviously they're going to be very different in terms of how much time that was wonder but all of them are going to take maybe a couple hours of the most writing is every good that's the the time scale the B allele hours yeah for a template identification that's about what your well you now many processors have not which memories bar for each one of them memory is dependent on how long your sequence is processors are you only ethic sips they go further chubs so these are all single parotid throw their independent jobs which is where the parallelization comes in yeah so it's embarrassingly parallel and you 911 yeah so look is it more parallel than that so did these take the entire sequence is an input or do you chop it off on fragments and then feed fragment II I don't know you're going to talk about domain division or is that something oh actually a total finger on my protein did this or could a problem put a single of my protein we didn't cut the protein to the segment we just are using the entire system as the input but further north automate four teams actually using some software to cut this protein to a different part or different to me then the two main level sequence will be put to his luminous rating method to keep at the template and further to the modeling step and after we get the individual moding of each to me we get the model of each to me we using another software can of merge these two domains together and this proof this help how to improve the product or accuracy of the model panel modeling is better than if they put the entire thickness without domains late to this unhealthy black that makes sense is most of these programs then try to make it interesting yeah so I know at some point I apologize it I'm skipping ahead that you taught these different templates up the pieces and you can use some fragments from one template and some fragments from is that what these lower steps here are on this slide or is that going to be downstream later so you might say as I understand how this works you could use the first 80 residues from chef Serge then the next 80 residues from SP 3 as your template going forward you don't have to you don't have to take the entire template is it not true that that's I pray not not to toll the entire sequence will put to each individual striving and which difference rating may have different algorithm Tom may pick up a very long college campus for this error signal and some program may be some short coverage compass for this very secret and artists will be murdered together so there is a this doesn't mean we the first fragment will input in this reading and setting the fragment the input food is ready so we actually put it and her statement who each trading program the dead the different the template oh I think the case that he's talking about is the case in which one program identifies first eighty residues are well aligned the one template and then another set of the residues are well aligned to another template rather then so in that case yes you will then combine those two separate pieces of information and Holdings it's not as if you split apart the fragments and then put one fragment in every reading program all of them are threating the entire see this is this is just essentially jane and someone yeah prediction yeah it's just consensus prediction see what the most likely domain is I think it based off of those specific all the output of all those different algorithms thank based off this section the most likely prediction is based on this section that was like we do is that right yep oh and a question so I guess the question based on what Marcus was thinking it's how much jefra gnarly outputs from these different how much different are they Africa Madrid have it if that's a that's a qualitative answer and they say somewhat acceptable but what you'd like to know it's some scoring system and it would be nice to know if there were many information about the target language of you I mean I assume that it's more likely make a good guess in it for whatever reason anything but you know beyond that a high entropy structure that you're trying to prepare to use a eukaryotic versus bacterial make a difference does and to the function of the antics and be spent function is much less yourself in sculpture trying to leave an empty function is it's pretty interesting topic deep in that okay then we will continue oh here they show the bank about the result of the Loom is a result and its content 11 singles writing server so why is the champs bar of the first a template so we can see who might house writing method Loomis it's at least ten percent better than the second based on measured Patriot afraid so disneys or actually be using Metis rating method it's actually improved to complete the identification or bleeding or in singles writing so another very important component of the theater is the contact prediction of programs here we show a headline of the contact predictor which never dies distributors are to play the rest all rich developed by our labor member yoni still starting from the first sequence we were first there can read the MSA multiple sequence alignment and thus we handle our eco evolution teachers which will be calculate directly from this multiple sequence alignment then our past hood beep rescue networks blocks then 1083 or feature maps the illness type will merge is a feature map or in one or feature map didn't pass through this or if rescue net work flocks okay then get the final three take the content map similar with this idea of using methods rating server or identify public we're also using a sorting individual contact or protectors instead of applying and this people are show the penetrometer result of this or contact predictors instead a desert the red bar means the contact Protectorate developed by our lab and the star map is taught our predictor are using a flinging of technology advice is not used to achieve learning so from this twenty mattress out we can see the measured using deep learning or training or deep linking technology oh it's much better than thought measured not using killing you messy mess is good as gremlin voices is that an area under the curve for successfully predicting a true contact what is that number probably precision yeah so this is of Tibet by access procedure and when we actually introduced some lower accuracy or proceed method to say it has people I need will fund for some special package that screaming or system treat still can generate some right can't a match for this special target so test why we try to using the meta Mather similar with the writing a crack are all of these methods running on the same database yep all training and when you train all of these you were training upon the same thing our shooters thanks I create those trees to treat the training pipeline or actually they may training by a different experiment of the culture and different I might say because some measure are developed by other groups but in our using we are free using the same MSA input this all individual contact predictors train the end of the deeper since we may notice this MSA is very important for the contacts of predictors to really build a new multiple sequence alignment generation software to our lab of the dependency which still combine a set of tingle as homology sequence detecting tools include the HTTP list or the camera there are single homology signals between code we using this combination of combination of the tours searching based or regular genome or different state space and made heart genome secret tape it here are compared with the regular genome sequence they face might hardly known our secret state space may contain more sequence which provide a multiple provide more tasks for your courtesy and detect them more formal achievements for your panel multiple sequence alignment and reusing the contact of predictors ooh benchmark printer the quality of MSA tenors from different headlines here the red bar means MSA generate from from our deep MSA and we show some control measures that ionized a generous from the sequence single promoter sequence detecting flows we can see for this Tao contact protectors if we using MSA generate from this if I mess a flag or performance is marked by certain other MSA generating software this means our Public Works paper the other software for this both compact it occurs after we taking the tablet information and untied operated content map reusing or simulation to sampling the cigar a combination of acquired or caught the price for this pirate protein so this pipeline is a Parrothead called Monte Carlo simulation or pack line here we using the initial confirmation from the low-mids trading so we'll copy it is aligned complete who as the initial confirmation of this pipeline and using the movement implied in the status of pipeline which show here to change this conformation to a new conformation the video pacing the metro policy rules through decide whether away upset this new conformation or rejected this new confirmation the Metro policy rules show here which you need calculate or energy for insert header which I will show the energy in this slide after the enhance our circle in this simulation we collect the accept of confirmation or decrease to this confirmation of poor then this all this confirmation will be used for generating the final model as we mentioned in the last class we need to calculate the energy to carry all Monte Carlo simulation to insert header we have full cans of energy potential or which the highlights I read is the contact of potential which we introduced the newly to those areas of a black this is the equation of this contact face the contact potential and it is crow sure the function of this people show the crow of this of this equation we can check this crop the X is the distance between residue I and the G or in your confirmation or you know decry during the simulation and Y is the energy values for example if you predict rescue I and EPA should be formed contact tax during your simulation you decoy this your a and the key are not formed the contacts so your energy will be your energy of this decry will be very high then push by this energy function of this to less you will be pushed together two forms or mutti mutti choir our new conformation which these tools you can form the contact then these the energy of this decoy to be get lower in this place this our way we design our energy potential like this flow or to get our Monte Carlo simulation actually when we use in single Monte Carlo simulation theory is very easily to pair to a local minima because if you set the temperature temperature in the hallucination follow dentist will be a very easily to trap to some local minima competitor with global minima who actually are we using the rubric I change a low simulation to solve this problem to wait tables and different replica of the color simulation with different initial template which coming from limits writing and with different country teacher dating after an x local women's die said Ezra we will swap the comforter confirmation or in the near the neighbor who replicas then our starting from that pool next total of the Montecarlo simulation at final we will collect all confirmation of the Christ generating from the lowest lowest style or temperature replicas then this first confirmation will be passed through the sky program micro we will try to last through this confirmation basing on the Seductor similarity between each device and the cluster center of the latest cluster will be selector as the type initial final model then since this our model will only contain the platform so we'll be using the IP MD program provided the side chain of this protein and remove some flesh and so on total team we will get the final model to this is the unhealthy flying of the Sahara but includes writing contact critic for Monte Carlo simulation for sampling de Christ and spy purple cluster 30 Christ and REM d for retirement to finals the doctor and here is the pension math we thought of the cetera sir Russell at hazard at history is a pure template-based semester and the state has her are in place post contact information and template information here each point means one protein in our revenge market side and blue point means the target protein that you can easily find the thumb buddha template and the red point means those protein you can't easily spend it or you can't spend it to put the tablet so from this benchmark we thought we can see our new program to help Ezra in mark paper than I'd hazard his threshold for both target that you can't find to the tablet so this new process our indicates are the contact information actually works well well in those that have a pipeline or are these targets is your counting more or less non-redundant yes or no no no no reason our gifts are yeah what is it this is a big enough data set that you could answer some questions no is it working better for bacterial proteins or eukaryotic proteins looking better if they have a larger hydrophobic amino acid content you know in 300 dots is a fair number of dots even in that hard category reading from the care but one very basic well I think of a very basic question it's hard targets where you're getting a lot of improvement when you incorporate these contact math fiction do they have a deeper and si all the way back when you tried to predict those kind not true I mean you could probably answer them better than I could yo constrain both hotpokket Carter has improved a lot yep and so there are our targets that improve a lot and there are hard targets where your predictions are targets where your prediction is still bad is it just that you don't have enough homology model you don't have enough homology sequences in your MSA agent or is it some other problem so I created this real Westendorf easy easy target there are some people in this so why is you confident it is good the template do is complete the information is not good at all this or either another you actually this contact adversity if not good I've made things easy target there's what we call the Torah in the appendix that that's not a surprise because more prevalent something is it's equal space in in fact protein structure initiative but it was running systematically going after targets that had a lot of mobile on first one though anything that's an easy target because there's a PSI over long years all yep it's almost certainly also going to be something that's going to happen I create the contact performance and the template performance are very related is the contact the performance of contact our predictor depending on the MSA generate from the sequence and actually is rating program which also using this MSA to generate some soldier settler is drug competition or Oh profile or is a concept or also generated from the state elements multiple cities around you're there almost a thread in using this profile concept to align or pick up the template from the leverage so no specific limit is a very important things impulse rating and contact that's right for the heart habit or if you can spend good public eye create you can scan very good contact Aida that's why and also it should be stated that the correlation between contact prediction performance and number of homologues is in fact there but a it's not as tight as you would think and be the correlations stops after a certain point meaning you get diminishing returns if you have enough all along huh that's why in our deep MSA pipeline it's possible to stop at either column 1 or column 2 if you have enough all belongs that going deeper into the multiple sequence alignment is not necessarily going to give you better performance and in fact in some cases will give you the worst performance because it'll introduce much more noise yeah that's good okay also this is our solo performance in gospel completion to create critical assessment of protein structure prediction or if the word Wed the experimental experiment for protein structure prediction so the organizer will release some sequence to prediction groups and instrumental groups the in prediction groups without or the guard or predicted of or throughout remodel and instrument hosted our groups we also this protein structure by experimental tests they work in independently or after several month later tour organizer will collect or model from predation who and experimental Sagara from the youth women thought that growth then they will comparator model and is really the structure and the run king the partition groups are the which groups performance well in the predication problem so Endicott verse 13 o our said hey sorcerer wrong height of first Cochran ultimate protein-coding solar fooling by the Seahawks which is or another contact fat or protein folding server or developed by our lab so this is the performance of our Odin throwing has four boys experiment to experiment and is very meaningful over that what kind of working can't both both of our fault both I see a desert here what will we means the fruit of all that it was all set as a motor have a chance twelve or thirteen thousand five then this means is target affordable here are we using this people who enter this pastry here X is the performance of your contact predictor why is the performance of your ad incomplete we can see in this to stability this means you help put a complex and the industry sub reason you'll have a good contact this means our either your output something or other you are all you have good contact the protein is portable but very interesting is in testable reason I never how good contact know you have good conflict but the do is do like 30% protein still comfortable in this sub reason so really using this a kiss to hilarity right there are some proteins still affordable in the subreddit oh so when we check the contact map the green point is the contact from East women to the doctor and blood parts in his stated contact so it is to find all access means right to read it otherwise the user on contact so when we check to a contact in this the reason we can see almost at ease contact our own content which means this content map is not perfect our memory chip check the a template or from this reading which surely in this tigre or the template are led by the read other of yellow color and green color is instrumental structure you can see although this bassist Greg aligned very well through your instrument of the culture the origin of these two Hilux in your template it's still wrong but when we check the continent we find the contact between is Alex and the dissipates today our is correct created from the continent so during the filling solution we can for this highlights close to this pitch strength for from the contact then you will get the blue panel model which is much similar with your instrument of departure then your initial complex so this our case our shorter power that using the first template and contact information to get your protein structure prediction it since home since Oh it's case to computer so we have to rapper or new protein coding program austerity sir which implies post information from striding template and the created contact by deep learning technology to credit the Monte Carlo simulation to photo 214 personal our benchmark that has raised at least or 46% Tettleton our former coding program at Heiser that's all thank you it's like a racial one kids who indicates as our state health of has biologists to Sodor parity problem so we know one of protein complex of ml l complex which is or and them that can regulate the gene is gracious so that means with our protein complex that can find the truth or DNA molecular but although this incompetent of this protein complex are already is thought but the entire complex that means how each individual monomer of OTUs our monomer films the complex to tend it is in a molecular unclear that's fascinating so what have you been able to figure out so now our collaborator they won't know all this protein things the complex so this soda because there is currently no software can talking this huge complex so this order current density map for this and her complex so you can merge this acronym and it like some sheep of the entire complex then title or assault is a crystal structure they want teaching each individual monomers culture to the density map to the ship then you can get or getting paid dispensed in math you can get the correct complex and funded the interface or between protein and DNA molecule but one program is a 1 content of this complex may is h-12 they don't have the crystal structure so we using our cell petrol builded model for this protein and the day using the thoth structure and the our model teaching each company food is current estimate or you can image the audio strip of this context then they detach did this protein complex like this and defend it to funding reasons between these are protein complex with this DNA molecular or is racial or one offending reason is just allocated into as h2 our model with this DNA which showing the speaker and we concrete placing on our complete leaf and takes the residue our clothes through this our DNA molecular so our collaborate with it do some experimental tests they try to mutate this are those six residues to other kind of amino equation then they found after mutation did at this complex will lose the repenting ability to this DNA molecular which those are our six out of the six ratio we plant in this in our predict model actually is the potential pending set for this DNA molecular so this work is published in this journal last year so this is does the indicate our self as a model can up our biologists who saw some biology power an equestrian lead that's very interesting it shows what it does is it would just drop these in fields long it actually would just drop the whole you know for new food actually you know it sits between the nuclear Sun so it's gonna but I've really opened up the chromatin structure way we didn't thought before it's very interesting a very good example I'm glad we had a chance but was there any energy minimization done after the superposition step always this generic model superposed into the infants who you mean you don't even for that Oh like was there any minimization who optimized how the interface was contacting DNA or was it just that we modeled it on American automatically and plugged it into REM density and just use the interface that arose as a result so actually we got the using the role model heating the inter feeding step of his women host doctor will to read forties teaching it from the printed or confirmation puto model we using the flexible VG which means the interface may slightly change compared with the initial role model and we this work is done by built and photo interface rescue because the calculated distance between those are tight between rescue with the auto me in this DNA molecular the other although if I recall your program it's just meant to pick the protein density into crying ham density but fit a protein structure into the crowd University it doesn't actually take into account energy of any sort rate I wonder how how this could change if you tried to use like a more visible course building well we know it's resolution cutoff here about the evening free low res and if you know but those contacts are interesting and could make a difference for your target I guess is just as they did with ribosomes that this is being out of the process there what you're dusting you know if you could refine them very good I guess is that it's just fitting the density right now but it's pretty cool you know you can see where you know there's some room for improvement up at the top near the 8sh Wow patents at but it's really pretty impressive don't you improve its already telling us things I mean it's really important you know certainly more informative than just like blobs from cryo-em believe it questions
