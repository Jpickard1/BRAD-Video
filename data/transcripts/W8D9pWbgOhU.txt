she saw was a student here in grad program mine you know when she graduated my wife Deb Walker and she wanted to know I do two PhDs and it just worked out that way she got her first PhD to by working on something call off the cell lying ontology which is the project we've started with David States and it's now used all over the world gasps it's remarkable it's a way you know what Sarah was really worried about at the time as I can remember is that there were a lot of mistakes with South culture and tissue culture in these cells that people thought maybe where he lives and you know and then later on with Albert there adil and I am powered Marco we did a project that was involving taking very noisy data from adverse event records from the Center for Disease Control in looking at how adverse events from the blue different computer muscular ends effects and looking at the adverse event and then relating them to systems that existing value system or the scientifically you know who is subject to what adverse events and how severe they were saw quite a difference amount of how much so that the bill and how it's going to be quite an impact it was a good after she graduated from here before she graduated compete she obtained a bachelor's degree from Thailand pronounce that my own University I'm glad you said you know where she got a bachelor's of science and computer science and she did we learned last night at dinner that she's spent in years scat as a visiting student while she was an undergrad and so after you laughter Sarah laughs know one thing I should say was she was a Fulbright Scholar you know that she came here is a Fulbright Scholar and entered the math program and you know at that point the rumor was that there were no bioinformaticians in all of Thailand she did she did sell our masters and then caught the attention to the food and draaga you know I joined the Food and Drug Administration in success not Hulk doc I'm obsessed yeah and she being the presidential trainee award at the American Society for clinical pharmacology there refuted that one paper that we worked out in material Abernathy who was here preceptor and advised him there at the Food and Drug Administration safety after not being a postdoc there for about three years how much they missed three years she laughed and I'm always the intrepid one moved to England and joined the group that is overseeing a lot of the resources that bioinformaticians news every day at the European bioinformatics Institute EBI with his desk near Cambridge England and he's been there I think and she's been working there for now three years he is rising up the ranks and is one of the lead oncologists and it's been involved in several projects that she's going to tell you about so I think one of the projects are going to tell us about a fight and maybe decide a project that you were so we're going to find out for folks like Marcy here card-carrying oncologist I think one of the things I would like for all the students in the room is you know it'll make us happy if you can answer the question one is an anthology and why is it important and so without it's wonderful they have me back Sarah and you know we're really looking forward to what you've been doing since you've left here and we're very proud thank you Brian for the very kind introduction so ten years ago I was in the audience here listening to people like Trey Ideker Peter soccer Peter carp at that time I was in the world how big of a deal that was so today facing the other way being in the same series it's my honor so thank you being a student in those chairs I know that the only thing that would get people to come here outside cookies is a catchy title and I do mean every word of it that having relationship is a complicated thing everyone can relate to that and so I'm going to give you a five-minute version of what took me ten years to learn of what ontology is and ontology 101 here so before you came into this dream I believe that most of the people if you probably have heard of the only ontology is very very famous and probably the oldest ontology the gene ontology everyone has do you know how oncology actually uploads some of you naughty um so yeah on holiday 101 subclass all is the most primitive most direct simple relationship that you can see as the parent type relationship insight on polity that was my first lesson learned about ontology so how is that different from other classification system that's point-to-point redundant information in the negative light in this screenshot everything is contained that is a protégé ontology editor developed at Stanford part of the NCBI Initiative many many years ago everything is the thing and the parent-child relationship comes in as you have a charge stemming out of a parent and it gets more and more specific so you can have having a relationship it's a complicated thing a complicated thing is a thing so I do mean every word of it when I when I put out that slide that title in the in the title slide so that listen one lesson to this is what a neurologist gets interesting you can have further information of parent-child relationship one one pair of relationship can also be in the different on on quality relationship with another term what do I mean by that so this is a cell line example it's not very easy to understand oncology so I put a lot of example on here a cell line can be defined as an entity that derives from another cell type and the cell type being part of an anatomy part that anatomy part is part of an organism and that organism can be the bearer of some specific disease we see a lot of the cancer cell lines and the cell line can also be classified as Mouse cell line or it can be classified as a specific cell type cell lines right so by having cell line derives from B cell and part of some organism part in a human or some other organism that's the example that I give in bjbj three sir why is it important that we have based information about cell line in ontology when you run a race in ER we try to teach the data that it can reason within itself making the logical thinking connecting one cell line to certain parts of organism or cell type we can help a parent another parent because in right now a cell line is just a side of the class outline but what if you want to find a cell line that is a class of some B cell cell line clipping it can be done because in that b-cell derive cell line grouping but you don't see having any children in the normal view of it suddenly becomes a parent of a lot of cell lines that has an attribute of B cell being part of some development co-state and part of important ISM this is the secondary classification that you don't see in other system of classification other classification that you see you see the one dimensional bit you see parent-child now you can have one term having multiple parents without having the duplicates definition of it you just define it once and then depending on the different views that you flip between the asserted classification or the recent classification of it so that's lesson two of ontology that probably took me seven years lesson three it is a lot easier to define concrete concepts not so much an abstract concept so when you when you help anatomy it's very easy to define that a finger is part of your hand your hand is part of your arm your left arm is an iron and you can also have the right arm that's very straightforward when you start coming into the Bell medical field you start seeing things like phenotypes diseases and to most clinicians it doesn't matter the whole the same and that's been my challenge to to tell them that no it's not the same you cannot have phenotype having the same definitions of disease so another example here to show this example that it's not very straightforward to define abstract concept it's how many wait can you can you define cardiomyocyte cardinality inside so this is a view from disease ontology so an example from two deceased on County is very specific to disease and they define cardiomyopathy as a subclass of myopathy which turns out to be a muscular system disease why isn't it a cardiovascular disease it's a cardio motor right you might ask that and they have the they have another another sub parent called the heart disease so you can actually have two parents defining cardiomyopathy in disease oncology the reason I'm asking you how many ways can you define cardiomyopathy is now that when you look at another disease in efo experience of that current quality cardiomyopathy we described it as cardiovascular disease but with the different attribute which is okay the way you build oncologists you build on how it is based on what you need so the same term can look different in different oncologists because it's used in different contexts I'm told you that resident also have cardiomyopathy but the context is different here yeah you can only have adverse event triggered by some medical intervention so in oncology definitions the cardiomyopathy inside oncology that first events look a bit different because now it becomes a process that is triggered by another process in the previous two examples cardiomyopathy was just a disposition it's just some cooporation oncology language that just tells you that it doesn't go on over the time but when you define something as a process it goes on and it has to be input and you have to output so that's the process so these are the three example of cardiomyopathy that look totally different in different oncology so that's probably what you know everyone here deserves the credit for that it took so many years I never published a paper that took so long to pop like that because it got grilled because of the adverse event of some some controversial discussion on the side effects of the flu vaccine and yeah I was I was I was the lead on anyway another cardiomyopathy is in human phenotype ontology and this is interesting because in this ontology cardiomyopathy is not a disease it's actually an abnormality in your body as a phenotype it's not going to details because I have a lot more so I've shown you examples of specific non polities I've mentioned gene ontology of mention disease oncology phenotype ontology cell line oncology in real world you probably ask the simple question like tell me everything you need to know about tp53 that's probably back in baozi ap where you ask that simple of a question in real world you ask these questions what by all biomed biological mechanism gets triggered when you when you when you receive person kinase inhibitors that lead to cardio toxicity side effects and when you think about these kind of questions it goes into so many domains of knowledge that you have to draw in and and and try to analyze for what the answer is and the other questions is what generating molecular Stila evidence do we have completely cease to target so you go and you go across the spectrum again and in this kind of question so the two examples I'm giving him going to tell two details in a little bit but before I go there I just told you that because you you you're trying to connect so many different things together and that's the reality the reality is you have a universe here a box containing a cat a dog a rat Noreen's a mango a finger and I'm tiny no I certainly no thing if you know how these things relate to each other congratulations you'd probably have a cat this is what happens here you can put relationships between the unrelated things but that's how reality work I don't know about other people's cat but in my reality in my universe my cat likes to see me fingers it likes mango it hates arranges it fights the dog not always lose and it was just this rats will always sniff finger that's I guarantee you hundred-person all the time you see a stranger cat would stick out your finger there will come sniffing your finger and I said I mean open look kill the cat so this is how the seemingly unrelated reality tends to really how do we represent that with anthologies so you see there are thing and if you remember that they must think everything in ontology is the thing you have animal you have plans you have chemical compound and then in the system of animal you have red cat and a dog and human while you know because a finger is part of human so that's how you put the relationship back into the link then you have planet which is defined by plants on again the NCBI taxonomy also has plans then you have relationship that Mouse is an animal dark is a animal cat is a animal human is an animal finger is part of human or you have CAPTCHAs Mouse cat fights dog cat will sniff finger after the mini open kill the cat cat like mango cap dislikes oranges so that's the ontology of cats and things and this is another layer of oncology's called the application on power oh by the way that is what it looks like in the real ontology of the NCBI taxonomy are the Willing different types of data together i mentioned the specific domain anthologies the example that you just seen this now is an example of how different oncology's are put together to create another layer of ontology called the application ontology and i do that with the air for the experimental fact an ontology what happens here is we borrow determines form each domain specific anthologies via the cell type oncology Anatomy uber on oncology team oncology disease oncology phenotype ontology we just take those terms borrow them from different anthologies Wow okay so the web ontology language is the blue 3c standard that is used to to and to generate an ontology so historically started all the biomedical ontologies historically started being a text file what take my call oboe open the medical oncologist then then we started to get more computational and they realize that a text file soon enough we need something like a complex xml to to capture all the the different logics inside the ontologies so with all you you have more explicit et with with your data and thus at the military standard so it's open source and then you get you get lightly support by the community as well so coming back to earth or this is just a summarized page that I can take chemical compounds in Cady ontology human phenotype on film in phenotype ontology they'll cut until oncologist cell lines which also interoperate with the cell type oncology over on anatomy in Finland ecology merge them together link them together but the linkages of these different authorities into one application oncologist is the value added to this and this is also the list of things that I used mostly in ESO and it's called domain-specific on automation it's called the application on politics there's a summary of what I'm saying this is the heart of it the text the black text that you see on either side of this can be represented by the different domain ontology with the cell oncology gene ontology still wine oncology Anatomy oncology but then we can link the cell line ontology to still type oncology through the relationship in the in the blue text here the blue texture is the value added that the upper level application on quality adds to the borrowed term from the different domain specific qualities and I'm gonna show you why this is important if I give you an example you probably get a little lost if I said that cell line is the barrel you see the device and cell type part of animal part and part of organism here until I do this and that the picture starts to get clear that by putting all that arrows here you're putting the relationship between the different ontologies so each of the images that you see here can be represented with the domain-specific oncology's building the bridge between different oncologists there is the common tasks in the application on holiday so I'd like to make sure that now everyone is clear on what domain-specific oncology is and what application on policy okay with the question like what genetic molecular evidence do we have that link species to target now we're stepping into their the motivation of why one would need application on poverty this is data that we work with in answering that kind of question we're working with animal more they're all stocked ecology chemical compounds encode we do use encode project at the open targets this is the hiss the use case of our open targets at open targets or open circuits use these information all the resources available at the EDI Sanger Institute GSK and bio 10 um with the with with the drive that drugs our MV is very expensive and we it fails and if it fails late it costs even more so we have to try to answer and find out the evidence of a drug um this is target Association to to scan and and screen through all the information but we have of what curcuit should we invest in and that's why they get funded like this so answering that question we draw in all the information of all the possible resources to develop emetics students may have heard of maybe encode reactant he was catalogue cosmic cancer mutations ensemble teams in the session at last and a lot more who occurred and all of that how do we use this data before I go there I'm just a quick summarized page of the kind of question that can be answered with this open target platform it looks clean and simple you can get the information about this example of PDE for the target you can filter it by the different biological pathways you can have the classification of different clusters of diseases based on their anatomical system or there or the Dean Proffitt theme in oncology dog culture and everything here um it looks clean but - and no voice you probably think this is easy it's not it integrates so much data in it so that if I dig deeper this is a run-through of if I cut in PDF worthy in that bigger picture if i zoom in on one of the one of the bubbles here you can actually see the different types of evidence that goes in there being I think this one is the chemical compound from Kindles I encourage you to just go to open target organ and play with it and if you search by a disease name what we get is a list of targets so if you search by Tech etiquette list of disease if you get if you search by this is to get a list of targets and at the top here you see that each column goes by the different data types that we used at open targets report so tonight accessor stations that G was catalog and clinvar in the European variation archives somatic mutations come in from cosmic cancer mutation drugs come in from Kindle and KB affected pathways come in from reactant fix my name comes from Europe EMC and mo-more they'll come from the wet lab in data that we have from Sandrine um piece of the boxes here the light blue and the deeper blue indicates the stronger scoring in the deeper blue and weaker scoring in the lighter blue and each type of data when it gets scored I'd like to credit the dough statistician in our group that a lot of thoughts has gone into this because when you think about it steep traits unless it's not as its new and one when you look at expression data its p value when you look at text mining for example it's tf-idf scoring and and normalizing all this court either to two carat or the overall story was a very difficult task and i cannot go into details about that but like that no we we are very fortunate that um EBI NHGRI and NIH we work pretty closely together so consortium like the gene ontology or she was catalog we do have the the meeting between the two sides of the Atlantic quickly often on the regular basis um and I forgot to mention but I am part of between how their sample you know type and oncology team a spot led by Helen Parkinson and in spot gene ontology experimental factor ontology any ontology thing at the EBI go throughout group and yep we have an office thirteen oncology as well um so so so this is another good example to gene ontology is it's the best known example of the domain-specific ontology that surrounds genes and EF or is the application oncology's that mandates are the data integration in the back end of all the EDI databases resources um you'll see so this is just an example of how when you click on the link it goes straight to the original source and this one is coming in 20 was kept a lot if you click on View s catalog link it goes up the orginal record from that it was kind of lock database and all these different kinds of data gets integrated and it's made possible only because all the data is mapped to efo so before we started open targets in the in the far right right left of this life here you see that at the beginning of Scylla databases were annotated to different on policies for example reaction was annotated to disease ontology European variation archive clinvar was annotated to omean Orphanage sno-med standard a glance and you know typology kin Vale was a notated to ATC classification which is a drug classification cosmic cancer mutation was mapped to NCI T and their own control vocabulary in no time at Sanger Institute was mapped to memo and phenotype ontology and human phenotype ontology so you cannot really integrate and build any connections between all these different data because there are different apologies from different domain-specific anthologies and that's why we need ontology like ear for the tools in consume subsumes in all these specific terms from different compatible oncologists because there are things that weren't compatible in entomology were like sno-med or I ncip servers these are the capillaries but they're not oncology so we've had to work to consolidate those differences in PDF oh and right at this moment after open targets was launched everything is annotated to earful and thanks I have to acknowledge the curators at the EDI EDI highly valued in human curated data set so all the data here are map to to depending on the team I'm aware that there are six in at last there are another five or six in Unicode so altogether each specific data providers they have their own experts in house so um KB they have four as I said and they hired more the the biochemist the bye okay bye Kim informatics people to curate and generate the new terms or tabi for this project and EF or borrow difference in KB and put the relationship and this is certain example of how how the G was catalog curator who sits to desk away from me that's all be authoring curation that us catalogs just kinda walk meet straight means and trade names unnecessarily DC streams so we have the workflow that go through the adding turns modifying terms and then listening all terms so that when you go to gos catalog website you can see that the beautiful visualization of the colorful dots that is good by the different traits and snakes and this is um the open target data release cycle were looking at the next release of open targets in October the next month um so at the top you see that it all starts with behavior release and that's how important the controlled vocabularies and holiday plays are in big a large-scale data integration then it goes through little sauce curation and mining the step that I've just mentioned here it goes through the pipeline and our life it before it gets mapped between the the two components that drugs know the deceased target Association through the different kinds of evidence here now I've just given you an example of how a really really really big data integration happens another kind of information that we need to mind to answer question like what about the CRO mechanism explained our current of credit public side effect in Paris in kind of an editor's cancer patient again we go was hired to do that at the SBA it turned out to be an awesome project so what what they learned is that it does cure cancer in a way but they notice that after all why it's so the patients start having heart failure and what causes that under the signal that comes up is it's too high to be coincident and it and it has so many factor into it the cardiologist said this is a serious heart phenotype and then the oncologist said it doesn't matter if we don't treat the patients the patient's going to die anyway so so that's not a does a very fun part of it yep so they want to understand they don't really know how how how cheeky eyes as the cancer treatment can cause their cardiotoxicity side effects but if they understand that then maybe they can start treating the patient with the cardio cardio toxic treatment at the same time or when we know that this is where it kicks in so that's the whole drive um behind this diagram - so motivation is that we know that T key is the N monoclonal antibodies molecules sort of cure cancer we don't know how it causes adverse events so on your left here is them it's the kind of domains where I mean this is the cardio Genesis pathway for chronic myeloid leukemia studied by Shane and all in and forth and Thomas forth and it turns out to be a very respectable paper in in a reference paper in the whole cancer tax cardiotoxicity study so when a bell bc earth domain gets activated it trickles these three pathways that five draft pi3 kinase that down brakeless apoptosis and doctor that is the the pro survival pathways and that leads to cancer here I had put in the example of anatomy which is considered a terrorism kinase inhibitor that that actually triggers also at the same time it ended it's able and an art complex which leads to ear trace and it goes down the it fails to restore the equilibrium inside yourselves and then depending on which party tube it can restore the equilibrium and apoptosis and cell death can can begin again or when too many cells have died because of the eon stress and causing their protein misfolding then the cell survival gets triggered but what they don't nobody really understand at this point is how how imagine it bluffing PDT are PDGF are going where and the food we know that blocked the earth stress what what does that work nobody really understands that and in this project we're hoping that understanding some kind of mechanism in there will help answer the cardiotoxicity side effects of the drugs and this is the per thing kind of inhibitors and what monoclonal antibodies the neural mechanism not how it blocks tyrosine kinase so maps interfere with like in binding so but it cannot get activated the chick eyes the lip the inhibitors block the binding of ATP so again the pathways get reactivated but when you treat cancer this is another dimension of complexity when you treat cancer the patients also receive cocktails of drugs right so now we're adding a very complex disease cancer is a very complex disease with complex Linotype and then cocktails of drugs how do you know for sure which drug causes what in your system so in this example we know that um there's a proposed mechanism that's in Italy also interact with the retina because they are taken as a cocktail in the cancer patient as well and it hits both end up in yourself and cardio myocyte both um both cells when it goes down to the pathway spheres we thought and compensated hypertrophy of the heart and again another source of of cardiotoxic after a student because when your heart gets enlarged and then it's not very functional and then you get heart failure so it just was taken this is why I was hired at the FDA the federa abernethie came up with this vision of systems from ecology the understanding that the the connection between each layers from the very bottom of all the way to the populations they only give you an insight to cancer cardio toxicity and he believed that oncology's can link all these different data together so thinking that could open target is along the same thinking where you're using multiple oncologist for different data to generate an integration pipeline to answer a specific question complication so we came up with this diagram that when you look at it in module what modular models you can have signal dictation detection model you can have preclinical clinical data analysis module you can have chemical structure analysis you can have non clinical toxicology coming in from the experimental part of the pictures but at the end of the day everything in their informatics is their hypothesis simulator you also you still need the knowledge expert to analyze and verify your your result this is an example of how bioinformatics can can expand your network knowledge we did so the in forced Thomas forests and change studies we came up with the thin network of the proposed cardiotoxicity in in CIT he carries recipients but then we did the text mining with on policy that I'm not going to go into details with another colleague we came up with that that pianist interleukin-1 oh that's that interleukin-1 CNF was the was what the human curated part that we added in all the green boxes in his new year's had the teams that we could mind from this oncology enhanced text mining the yellow boxes that you see here with the pathway proposed by Thomas forth from that previous picture comes this diagram the different colors they represent the different oncologist and again we're building the bridge between different oncologists through and through a relationship how do we do that so that was we had the trans Mart in the instance of the FDA and we store our data in different orders like that but they're not very oncology compatible so here's what happened with serious train of thought I try to break it down to grouping of related terms and each grouping here I I know that I can represent them with the different domain oncology listed in the table and then I can generate a subset of here for terms that can represent the data in pretty tough project so again same line thinking of integrating all the data in the earful there is no adverse event component in it when you look at the year the original year both but we can assert in you can insert a chunk of ontology of adverse event inside this year ovations of predict talks because it follows the same parent guideline that we have in the oval boundary of how you share their components if you follow the the traitor with of the tree you see that adverse event is categorized as a pathological bodily process which is a process when you look at year for predict Tufts on the right-hand side you also have a process and if you look into the ontology by both pathways in the two sides here they refer to the same common thing in the oboe boundary and that's how you can clock in the adverse event model into this newly generated ear or predict talks in summary the benefit of application ontologies that I can summarize for you here you can use the application on holodeck efo to do the smart searching that's taken from at last and McClure express cream shop data analysis here that's taken from the gene ontology analysis tool data integrations that open target example and data visualization like I mentioned that you can have the beautiful colorful groupings here every patient every dot of the colorful dots here the classified by EF attorney this is the slide that from everything that I've mentioned post-fire it is it does not me doing all the manual work with developer tools to help you annotate your terms into an ontology attorneys we have the oncology lookup service OLS at the EBI we have donor which try it takes your text try to map your text into the compatible ontology terms and when you don't find the ontology terms to be man to your data we also accept like an Excel spreadsheet file that the expert filled in with their expert domain knowledge like disease or cell line or whatever and then I take that spreadsheets and run it through a little bit below here and we're blessed we'll just crank up the on policy classes for me and my job is to make sure that the newly generated classes fall into the right place in the classification with the right logic reasoning inside the on poverty so before and here these are the people that I'd like to thank other than everyone here in this room it's a very big project and dr. Luther handle another big name in bio ontology Society said on two separate occasions that I have prayed at the bio curation meeting in Geneva this year and the bio creative leading in Oregon just a few months ago that if the oncologists do our job right the users may never know that we exist but they will notice when we don't exist and you don't get when you don't get the result we do the query I never comment on that to the students here I'd like to leave a few word for you find your role model listen to him follow him because I did and it went fine because with that he came dr. brand AV always coming to 527 mentioning that we should be reading this book and one of the book that he said was that I should read well as the age of the spiritual machines turned out to be amazing came to visit him again two weeks ago he's to give me aa a homework car Detroit is my own hometown it's a very interesting book because um now I want to see the brunette Venus I'm not going to tell you who she is you just have to read this book or it tells me the story of this Detroit businessman who wants to reduce the price of the of the car Bob the auto body that we did because I was making too much profit by the way he was the first man who ever built the word or Auto body or diem no that wasn't why I went into this book at all this book was first published in 1946 and this is the reprint of it and on the on the first very first page it actually tells you how it's published how it's reprinted you might think I'm crazy it actually was from a very rare book and that's very rare old book written by mr. Malcolm Wallace being how they were printed this book they use the optical scanning which turns out to give you a lot of false positives because the book was old and rare it tries to use some program from computer algorithm to correct those mistakes and titles scanned by the optimist and at the end of the day human has to read it and still fix one of those little mist pipe that that that the the computers are incinerated lesson learned same thing with the bioinformatics doesn't matter how awesome your program is you will still need the human to do all the final validation thank you I have to give this back to you I guess I you know so you're gonna walk out of here and tell us what an anthology is at this point I did tell you I did the first five ten minutes you know yeah yeah it's it's it's how you taught me to you don't directly give me what it is you actually made me think a lot of what it is and I hope I did so you know at this point like the book I mean you know things have done digitally now so is there some kind of check what you know whether it's the life of a curator well so again I have to replace that that if the oncologist and the curators do our job right people will never know that we exist but you are actually missed greatly if we don't exist because you're suddenly when you go to a large database trying to query for something it will take you three years before you get any results back because we cannot do the query the the old way anymore it cannot do the cross joints between different oracle sequel databases and tables and and now everything is in the cloud so it's not very convenient to do all the spark ah to do all the SQL query over Oracle servers in multiple locations not everything isn't a sparkle query and that is a sql-like queries that is done because everything is on the different sites in the cloud gets annotated to reference URI at the identifier is for oncology so let's see if I can figure but you know the idea of a data Lake could be that you put all your data in there and it's unformatted and then the schema or the data mark would be where the schemas are made up ahead of time kind of like you're running the knowledgebase uphill it's my guess that you're creating you know you're using you're building the ontology but then you know moving the data into elements of the ontology in a similar fashion that you might do in a day you know in a data warehouse scheme so that when you query the query against the knowledge base but it's much different than you would with Google where you get a statistical classifier that weights the terms up into this query it seems to me that what you're trying to do is encode the knowledge into a knowledge and actually survive the elements of the information in data which would be more about one of a data warehouse been a data like the you know I think the thing that you talked about was normalizing all of these different data sources to a referential ontology and I think that's the key that's needed when you're doing a warehouse or a data Lake or you know a lot of the Big Data folks don't believe in either approach what some of it is right but I think that's you know I think some people think that's going to hit a wall as well without ontology so in my recent experience and everything that's where I'm moving towards more of the clean of all data if this is the task that is only realized when you sit at the data and you really there's no way you can use this data and that comes in late very late and and so when you when you try to plan when you write a grant you try to find on a proposal you don't see that it doesn't get into the proposal and do the problem so gets up yet gets approved and then you get the money and suddenly you have to to do it and now you have to submit your supplements that's not one to say the three of us I know it's times almost up Nick's on the 19th Monday the 19th three of us are involved in a UO one that's kicking off another investigator coming it's looking at a metadata ontology for informed consent for biorepositories specifically and I'll send you the notice it might be Pinterest two people in this space because it's not the real stuff it's the abstract concepts yeah so there are many examples in that realm and the bad news is it didn't get realized and - it's very late in the process the good news is they actually realize it when they have to realize it I actually would encourage the students throughout there's no battle stupid question - stupid answer I suppose all thing ontology are created when someone - well have experiments to buy a new function and there is no explaining previous ontology so I I don't know how you geo terms are created I guess it will only be created if when you previously uncharacterized function is part of an experiment however in fact when I look at the unique Moche of Geo a database there are some trio there are only annotated or IEA evidence there's no world of experiments - so what there are two parts in this so gene ontology and scene ontology and notation there are two separate offices they're related I'm for the gene ontology part of it if I may say there are knowledge driven part of the on holiday CoA in an ontology and notation is another team where um you can you can get submission there's a portal to do that online where you make the request that I have this experiment and it should be annotated and it should be added in in oncology that way so there are two ways to submit information both both actually would take there are curators in both both do and do it and make up the the gene ontology consortium which has the collaborators both in America and I can't tell you in details how to do that but I can redirect you to the right person to ask the question if that helped and your second question my second question is on average how soon we were happy we were published let up experimental paper become a new geo annotation because sometimes I found the wet lab experiments that little annotation is how many years after I okay I would try to in a sense in a sensible way because people don't notice the curators exist sometimes we don't get funded and that's probably where we get the delayed in annotations some other kind they have to have their own system of distributing tasks it's not one and it goes different places it's like you get to get this portion it is for syndicators portion of the quest so I cannot answer which team is going to put in their notations faster than the other team they're also the case where team D do it in a new gene ontology annotations started working on a few years ago on the annotation of the team functions but gene ontology exists a lot longer than that so they started working on that this antio at this point and sometimes they have to go back with a little stick cheaply and annotate the data for many years ago so that could also be the case console in your scenario of your question there can be of these cases but I will be stupid answer so I'm wondering if you could talk a little about the some of the challenges you might have encountered between the nonmetals and based on colleges and ones that were essentially built along Lobo foundry principles so there are people who called their own policies on colleges and I don't believe that they're good on colleges and there are the over 100 people who would believe strongly in a shared common elements of building on qualities there's also the hybrid between the two parties called yet only where it's not about boundary because we don't define our domain we just borrowed terms over country essentially in the bio oncology world on a good oncology follow certain rules and we tend to disregard the rest of anthologies of naanum policies of their vocabularies until the cover it's just a lot like i-39 18:10 sno-med there's also framework like CDs finish l7 who in my experience they help try to build a shelter and on call it is and then they can only cry but there is there's a common ground because on the one way on the one hand these are the vocabularies that it is heavily in the other part the important part like EHR sno-med ICD say this SL 7 mid returns these are heavily used in the clinical doom which very there was a big disconnection in the middle between that side of the world and the on policy side of the world and the stuff where I come in that's where I started building cross-referencing between vocabularies like nature out of adverse events or when I look at the issue 7 and see this framework and try to identify which which element inside the hl7 framework or see this framework that can be replaced with specific domain oncology there's still work to do and as a matter of thought when I go back next month there will be another C disc adjusting and meeting with the oncology group that maybe I can resolve this so there's just emerging it's no longer very disconnected anymore because now ask us we after work get smaller and smaller and now that the the clinic the clinical part got to realize that data our community this that listening to us and at the same time we start learning that actually there's some biological and clinical relevance that that we need to listen to how they use the data and then we can start building that data because I'm very good at talking to people that's why I'm put here to do the job I hate going back to gene ontology because I know use a big one everybody knows but is there any way at these symposia and social levels that you guys protect against terminal ontology terms or terms that are informative but Singleton's applying to only one specific I don't believe there's such restriction on that um so it took me 10 years to do oncology and I try to give you the five minute versions of it so in oncology um I briefly mentioned that it's context specific so it's very important that when you see in terms I cut in your site you might grab the first thing that you see but before you do that you actually need to investigate the context of the definition of it cardiologists and oncologists might not have the same definitions of cardiomyopathy or NCI people have their own vocabularies that goes into the details of great state one greatly greater you get four of cardiomyopathy different grades have different definitions too so so sometimes if you see that the terms you know that exist somewhere but how come it doesn't get used it's probably because the expert when they investigate that term they actually look deep into the definition and become part of it and it's you know and that's that's when the call is made because in year four that I maintain I know that there are so many disease terms that I create myself even though it exists in the face oncology because the definitions inside the deceased oncology doesn't fit though that the use case that I use that open targets and that I think might be most of the times why it doesn't get this and again another reason might be people aren't aware that it exists thank you very much it feels really good to be young let me thank all of you for coming especially the students we have a very good turnout today and I'm proud to see you all here I hope you'll be back on a regular basis I'm gonna learn about new things each week not just things you already know a lot about Syria we're very proud of you then only you are wonderful ambassador for our program and a sterling graduate but you've shown you can go off on a path of your own choosing any place where you know so often people say well where's the role model to do this or that or the next day I was inspired about 40 years ago by a prominent professor chief of Medicine University of Washington when I was a young fella he had a plaque on the wall it's that do not ask what path to follow go instead where there is no path and leave a trail hope I'm doing that we need more oncologist students so please if you have any question you can talk to me and we do take internship at the EBI so if you have the slight interest in oncologist email me oh yes I have visited there several times it's a wonderful education beautiful environment it's worth taking her up on this opportunity thank you I forgot to put that up so thank you all
