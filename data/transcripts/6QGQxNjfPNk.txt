guys M's GNA M's going to do the intro but this is my old friend from way way back and I just glad you're here because this talk is going to be fantastic I know that yeah so it is my great pleasure to introduce Dr Jing wung um she was originally trained as an engineer first in electric engineering I you're doing some circuits like fpg yes yes and then in biomedical engineering um with this training she now leads a group at the University of Massachusetts to study Gene regulation protein protein interactions um and to annotate regulatory elements in the Maman genomes as part of the incode and igf um consortia in addition to research Dr wung has been quite influential educator and supportive of um Next Generation researchers for example she taught a computational genomics course at Boston University which was taken by our colleague Steve Parker who says it was one of the most rigorous yet rewarding courses for him and she shared her academic Journey with um high school students yesterday at girls who code um Dr W has been one of my role models as well so it's my um honor and pleasure to host her in Michigan today please join me in welcoming Dr wung thank you so much good okay thank you so much Mii for inviting me and K five also even though he cannot be here today um yeah I was going to say something about Steve Parker before he walked in too late he he's on time so um so when Steve was a PhD student um I was a new assistant professor I struggled with the teaching mightily so I am very appreciative he was very supportive as a brilliant student and still has good things to say about my teachings and I met uh Brian your chair when he visited our program I remember I got a chance and squeezed myself into the conversation with Charles my PhD mentor and that was pretty fun so yeah one my best friends ment too yeah exactly so we are all connected in a big academic family tree and uh still like each other and I tried to recruit Steve as an assistant professor he's not very well here so no mistake made made and I try to recruit Mii as a post and she's done very well here too you see I have very good um eyes for good people too it's just you know Brian somehow want them so kudos to you so I'm going to talk a bit about my research today and I am very happy you can make time to come and listen to me so um yes I'm honored to be speaking at the first named Department of basic science in the nation so I read it in the news so congratulations to you all um it really means a lot a previous founding leader of a department it's IND Dow the department which such a huge gift from personal um income and I I find it to be very hard for me so um I think it's it's rather Exemplar also speaks very highly of the high quality science of the department so um I want to start very basically with um three overarching questions we're interested in and I'm sure you also are interested in these very basic questions the first one is even though our genomes are very similar 99.9% identic between any two of us we obviously have some differences in physical traits Behavior and the sus susceptibility to diseases and the second one is um even though all the cells in our body uh except for like maybe plasma cells for making antibodies um all the cells have um the same genome except for somatic mosaicism or somatic mutation they have any qualifying phrases here um so the cells have the same genome and they have very different function and uh appearances So What mechanisms lead to their diverse phenotypes and functions and also we are very interested in using Evolution to study the changes um Divergence conservation of these regulatory elements in the human genome um because um regulatory elements they evolve quite quick and by looking at the correct evolutionary distance namely the meleon lineage in the past 100 million years we will have the best chance of um figuring out which ones have changed which ones are conserved which we think are more likely to be functional so how do we study regulatory elements in the human genome um so we call these regulatory elements candidates Sy regulatory element because we Define them using epigenetic data um not yet validated them using functional data the reason for studying them is um even though um so if you look at the human genome um only 1.5% of our bases in the genome encode for proteins these are protein coding exons the rest of the genome is noncoding um even though the vast majority of our bases are non-coding um we believe regulatory elements really deserve um a lot of focus because if you look at the genomewide association studies um they find that 90% of the disease Associated genetic variants lie in the non-coding portion of our genome however they are highly highly enriched in regulatory elements so if we study regulatory elements we will get the most B for the buck so to speak so um how do we study these regulatory elements so our mode of action is to join a lot of consorti um so we use epigenetic data with laric consortia um my lab does not do any wet lab experiments um we're not able to and we try to focus on doing large scale computation using Consortium data so I was part of the encod project for the entire two decades and for the second half of the decade I was leading their um data analysis Center so I likely have been um leading the data analysis and coordination center for the psych en code project which is a project focused on psychiatric diseases and we we were part of tunia which is a consortion for evolution and in mammals and then most recently um we um joined this um multiomic for health and disease Consortium last year and I will talk a bit about it I don't have any data on it but it's might be a fun consortion for you to pay attention to so um our effort really started in early 2000 um a lot of you might not be born or or still in your I don't know grade school or something I don't know lose track of time um so um en code um at the end had like 500 members and it was generating a lot of data that has um been used widely for the community so we focused on um data including um uh the different kind of epigenetic data that could be used for defining regulatory elements including um transcription Factor chipseek data um and code I sto updating this slide after we had like 5,000 data sets I'm just like okay forget it it's more more than 5,000 and tens of thousands of data sets um so uh transcription factors so um uh 8% of our protein coating genes are transcription factors so when we have 20,000 protein coating genes it's like 1600 of them are transcription factors that's a big number and for each one of them you have to make an antibody uh or knock in some kind of tag to pull them out for chipstick experiments and encoded a lot of that and also hist marks um are very telling about the Comon environment in the cell so you can also perform chipseek on them and of course um open Comon I remember Steve was working on that when he was a post do with Francis Collins and the um for um liberating the region of the genome that's accessible U to the nucleus so en Cod has a lot of DNA data and later on a taxic data so um here is um encode phase three consortion paper um people in my lab um Joe Moore Michael pararo and Henry prep were the students in my lab and really did a lot of data analysis using encode data and uh um we um from this paper we defined a registry of CCI which has been the foundation of a lot of our sub quent analysis so I want to give you an like very quick overview of how we do it using a specific Locus so sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription Factor almost every cell has it so you can see DNA data showing open Comon regions of the sp1 locus and you see hisst Mark data two of them specifically here H3 K4 me3 is a mark for um active promoters h3k27 AC is a mark for active enhancers and they coincide very well with the open chatin regions and ctcf is a protein that binds to insulators so if you look at this Locus sp1 you can see that we use a combination of these epigenetic data to Define regulatory elements such as promoters enhancers and insulators so that's kind of the gist of what we did and here is more like the whole thing on a large scale so here is um a bunch of um DNA's hypers sensitive sites here um we use that as a foundation of defining um our CC and you can see that um each row is a different bio sample and these open compon regions all kind of line up even though some of them are ubiquitous others are cell type specific so we use an algorithm to detect them at the bottom as these boxes and then um in total um we have millions of these kind of open Quon regions and then we layer on these other signals I was talking about earlier H3 K4 M3 h3k27 AC and ctcf all of them in combination we Define them as CC that's basically what we did so in total if we focus on humans there are 2.35 5 million ccres these are mononuclear SoMo sided regions around 250 base pirs each in the genome and the idea is it's really a repository of um candidate this regulatory Elements which represents the regulatory repertoire of our genome and it's like not specific to any cell type however in a particular cell type for example here herpet toite which are liver cells um you see that um there are um different regions here like these are the ccres these are the boxes and uh um the sorry I clicked something so um the um the colored ones are the ones we believe are uh active and regulating htide function and they correspond to open Quon regions and uh um active his marks for example or insulator binding however um I want to also mention this is a Locus corresponds to a liver specific transcription Factor called hnf4a very important for the liver so obviously um it's the whole site is light up lighting up very beautifully however if you go to a different cell type for example in neurons at the bottom and the neurons doesn't need this h&f for a Locus so this whole Locus is completely silent even though the insulators are still functional at the other side so the idea is um every different cell type will pick and choose a subset of roughly 150,000 of CC to use and regulate the cell type specific function so that's kind of the work we did for encode at that time and one thing that um a bit surprised us was um we obviously have data for human and mouth and uh um we could look at the conservation of these CCI between the two Maman genomes and uh um we can look at them um using um The evolutionary conservation data right now right at that time available which was um for example phop scores across 100 vertebrate genomes and you see that the CC are on average much more conserved then the random genomic regions which would be in this um uh gray color the bottom um however um these are different types of CC um and I don't show any error bars in this figure because the arrow bars are huge right so some of the elements are highly conserved but some of them are as unconserved as the random control so we have always been wondering since our encod paper um are these low phop PCC is truly unconserved throughout vertebrates or would a show conservation if we had more genomes in more recent evolutionary time so that brings in our zomia project so uh as part of the zomia project we had access to 240 Mamon genomes which are um in a more evolutionary time far more recent evolutionary time than vertebrates so the same curves you saw earlier for vertebrate uh phal P are now in dashed line and if we make the corresponding uh phal P score using um melan phal you see they are much more conserved indicating that when we are looking at the closer evolutionary distance we can see a stronger conservation so it's also shown in this um uh triangle plot which has the y axis indicating um out of the 240 genomes how many of them have more than 90% sorry I'm getting used to this um more than 90% of a cc being conserved and uh um the um x-axis is the complement um how many of the genomes have less than 10% of the CC being conserved being aligned remember ccres are like on average 250 base pairs law so we can do this calculation as a fraction of length so um these X and Y coordinates they are complementary to each other by Design so every cc is a dot in this triangle and you see this corner that corner is the most conserved Corner um CCR is so instead of um like a third of them being conserved between human and mouse if we look at 240 Maman genomes we have more power and we can detect um 47% of them that's more than a third being conserved across this collection of Maman genomes in this corner here group three are the primary specific ones and in contrast if you were to take corresponding regions in the human genome randomly chosen you will see this conserved corner is much less red meaning much less populated and the human specific corner is very red even though here for ccres very few of them are human specific so we can um also be more quantitative we can take um the entire set of say a million ccres like 2.35 million for example in this paper it was the earlier version so it's 1 million and then the other dimension would be the 240 genomes so we have a big Matrix of A Million by 240 each element is the fraction of the CCI being alignable in each of the genome and then after some Dimension reduction fed into umap and you can see a entire spectrum of landscape from the most conserved cc to the least conserved CC so each dot is a CCI in this map and then they basically validate you can color this U map with all kinds of things like fraction of conserved um bet positions um any other things um in the paper if you look at our paper you'll see we color it every each way and they all correspond with each other so there is a consistent um progression from the most conserved ccres to the least ones we can also do this for individual binding sites of transcription factors remember I mentioned that there are 1600 transcription factors in our genome and and code has performed chipseek experiments for hundreds of them so here is um my uh uh hent 4 a favorite transcription factor for the liver um you can take their sites these sites are around 10 base pairs and do the same analysis you basically see qualitatively the same thing so um you might be asking me um why are these clusters right um as it turns out the Clusters correspond to um CC that have been or what transcription Factor binding s the same thing they have been brought around our genome and also the other mamian genomes by transposable elements so I know that there are a few of the labs here interested in tees transversal elements so I want to point this piece of result out to you um for example like cluster a here um are only in gr eight cluster B here uh you have to find it here um here and they are only in great apes and oldw World monkeys so on and so forth so these are different um waves of transposable elements moving them around in our genome and uh you can you can see that each clusters they correspond to different types of transposes um um here are the trans bosom in our genome like line one and Alo and LTR long terminal repeat transposon tend to be younger and the other families of transor zones are older like line two would be very old um and these arrows indicate these clusters and just many many repeated waves of transo zones moving these regulatory elements around and in total if you look at all the primary specific sites it's quite shocking that 86% of them are due to transposal really it's like a genome mover um in terms of um what they do so um and uh um we can look at the The Other Extreme um now the primary specific but look at the ones that are evolutionary constrained in the Maman lineage so we perform this systematically for each transcription Factor here I show two of them yy2 and hnf4 again and you can see that if you plot them by the phop across the 240 mammals you see this by Modo distribution um there is a bunch of position uh transion Factor binding sites that are um not visibly conserved and there is another mode these we call them constrained ones they obviously they're distinct from that one so um we used a gan mixture model to plot out these sites in the genome for each of the transcription factor and the ones that are in this mode tend to be more conserved um show a stronger um uh enrichment for their transcription Factor binding Motif and so on and so forth so we we focused quite a bit on these constraint sites um so we took chipseek data uh from um a published paper um on um each of the transcription Factor we analyzed hnf4a again um across different mamian species here um human uh monkey one of them um and uh dog mouse and rat and uh each row is a transcription Factor binding site hn4 a binding site and the ones that are constrained the second mode in my bodal distribution are the ones above the line you see the ones that are constrained tend to be bound across the individual Maman um species also in in liver cells the same cell type um the ones that are not constrained other the ones below the line they tend not to be bound in the other species and the some of them are blank because they are no longer aligned even in their genomic sequence so um the conclusion is the ones that are constrained in the second mode tend to be bound by the respective transcription factor and also um they also tend to be stronger those are the purple ones those are the constru Str the ones um they tend to leave a footprint um that you can detect using open Quon data and they also um the constrained ones versus the unconstrained ones in human if you look at DNA mulation in normal cells and the cancer cells they have very different patterns so um different different sets of regulatory elements so um finally let me loop back to the um hog genome Association studies so um there is one way of calculating the enrichment of the uh the variance associated with different traits um uh uncovered by H genome uh Association studies how much they are enriched in different partitions of the genome so if you start with um encode uh ccres that's what we defined earlier um the enrichment is around five and if you go to zomia constrainted nucleotides it's higher but on top of that um if you use our second mode of um melean conservation for transcription Factor binding sides and you see the even higher enrichment in um annotating G variant so that was one of the goals of our work and then we moved on we have this platform and we can combine um our CC platform and single cell data um as part of the cych en code to study the human brain so um um as part of the ccres now we use um uh new one which is a a nucleus membrane antigen um using cell sorting um to get um new neurons and gleo cells separately um attack seek data um in um adult and Fetal brain tissues so we can Define CC a subset of them to be brain specific um 361 to be more precise 361,000 of them some of them are adult specific some of them are fetal specific some of them are uh shared by adult and Fetal and then furthermore we can use the new and sorted cell in the nuclei I mentioned earlier to um these these were done on adult tissue so we can detect neuron specific glear specific neuron and glear shared in adult brain cells so we can further classify our cc into these possible functional categories and uh um in order to see whether or not um the functional categories make sense U we can use a lot of external data for example the Vista enhancer collection and these are um by um L pacu and colleagues um injecting um possible enhancer regions into Mouse embryo with a reporter Lex Z reporter and then later on um if you look at developmental Mouse embryo to see where the reporter lights up indicating possible function in a tissue specific manner in Mouse embryo so if we look at our tissue specific um fetal specific specific brain specific ccres you see the highest enrichment is for brain region Vista enhancers and uh um also fetal and brain and adult shared it's also enriched in brain and however the other categories of CC or non CC they don't show such enrichment and specifically non CC a lot of them are inactive so indicating that um our annotation is um like to be correct and uh we can use single cell attack data um uh so here are the main cell types in the brain estros sites excitatory neurons inhibitory neurons microa and so on and so forth um and for each one of them we can annotate how many of our brain specific CC are likely to be functional in each cell type and with these we can go back to the Jas Associated variant again um so um we can we have a collection of this kind of variant uh this kind of J studies we can divide them into two groups one group is associated possibly related to the brain function the other group is not brain related and you can see that um for each of the brain cell type the CC that are annotated by us to be likely functional in Nel type is highly in Ed in the variants associated with brain related traits indicated by the red bars except for microc Clea which is a brain resident maccrage it's also enriched in the variants in associated with non-brain traits specifically immune traits and we can um take the um the the cell type specific like these ones the ccres that are unique to each cell type or a group of cell types here and we can feed the sequences of such CCIS into variational Auto encoder which is a deep learning model and unsupervised and if you look into the embedding of the model the variational auto encoder um these cell type specific ccres segregate very easily into groups completely untrained indicating that the sequences themselves already contain the regulatory syntax um without any uh supervised learning you you can separate them into groups um in collaboration with Uno kogi um we can use um a taxic signal in specific neurons or glear cells to train convolutional neuron networks such as his model qu bpnet to predict the basically the input of qu bpet is CCI sequence DNA sequence and we want to train the model to predict this nucleotide uh resolution a taxic signal and then we go back to the model and ask where in the sequences are the nucleotides that are important for the model's performance and here the tall letters are the nucleotides important for the convolutional neuron Nets prediction and they look very similar to transcription Factor binding motifs and for example like crab one here and there are multiple copies of them in a train even by ey it's very difficult to see even though the model knows nothing about transcription factors but it can pick out positions that are important for the model's performance and they correspond to transtion factor finding sites and here is nfy it's quite remarkable and then um we can combine um this kind of motive analysis with single sell RNA data and to get at cell type specific regulation and here um is a neuro binding sites and only in excited wi neurons it has a very high um important score for this deep neuronet model in high conservation and not so much in the other cell types that's it's less likely to be functional um similarly um spi1 binding site this is a immune transcription factor it's only important in micro clear and highly conserved and it's it's part of um um spi1 here in our single cell attack uh single cell RNA and attack analysis and these binding sites um TF transcription Factor binding reflects the lineage of the cell types in the brain for example when you see um High um importance score for um can't quite tell from here um all we go D sites thank you Brian um you also see subar but still high scores for other gear cells if you see it for neurons you see the other type of neuron except when you go to microa it's completely flatlining for the other cell types because microa is not part of the brain cell lineage is a immune cell type that invades the brain so you don't see these other ones sharing the regulatory syntax so um um as part of encode we also um want to make sure what we have computed all these are heavy compute how do we make our resources accessible to the community so um we have these um let's see if this works oh yeah so we have a resource called the screen um screen. um enco project.org so here every element is basically um a a um um click and uh browse kind of resource um instead of each data set being a element each element here is a um CC transcription Factor binding site a gene so so we basically um itemize all of our calculations and then put the rest into a database for others to browse and search and look and everything linked and and code data all linked in there and from talking to Jay this morning I think maybe we will work with him to put our data into his knowledge graph yeah exactly I learned so many things just in the past two days here talking to everybody learning new stuff um we have another resource called the fact book and it's basically similar um it's the the the focus is transcription Factor binding sites um similar to screen for ccres and we put all these um um thousands of um encode high quality transtion Factor chipseek experiments we analyze them all and digest them and then display the results in Factor book so finally a bit of teaser about what we have been doing lately so the multi omix project we have no data so I apologize yet but I'm very proud of this project um it started last year yeah um so um it's a project to study um six diseases um uh has uh has um disease DSS disease study sites six disease study sites and then there is one omx production Center um and then I am leading the data analysis and coordination Center so here are the uh three types of centers and disease site um omix production and uh data analysis so here are the charters so here is some justification for why we need this consortion we call it mode so um a lot of um single omeg data um they are limited so a lot of you are going into multiomic so multiomic for people typically refer to single cell attack or single cell plus single cell RNA in the same cell that's what people say they are yeah the mum but here we what we say what we mean mome is the integration of genome epig genome transcriptome proteome metabone U metone and all the vs and um from participants across six diseases each disease has 200 cases 100 control so all these ohms across um 1,00 participants and uh um the participants will be recruited by the six disease study sites and all of the OM data will be produced by one location the OM production Center so for us this is great because um um we'll probably likely to have less batch effects because every everything is produced in one site and also it has disease versus control and across three time points so we can study the progression of these disease diseases so what are the diseases um stud being studied by mode um two diseases are on um metabolic associated liver diseases for adult and uh youth separately two diseases are on chronic kidney diseases one is diabetes related the other one is not and then one disease is on preeclampsia and the last one is on asthma so why were these diseases chosen um they are known to be impacted by both genetics and very various environmental exposure including social determinants of Health um and uh one thing that's unique about mode is um more than 75% of the participants will be recruited from uh genomically under represented uh populations so that's also uh quite lacking in the past of genomic research so in long-term goal um we are going to um um develop scalable and generalizable multiomic research strategies and set a stage possibly for future advances of these kind of disease specific um studies that could benefit uh prevention diagnosis and treatment in all human populations so very grand um goals for the project so um my last slide is um we are going to have a lot of fun because we are going to um get a lot of data we love data and the data will be multi dimensional um it'll be unique in a number of ways we'll be have persons from ancestral diverse populations we without specific diseases will be harmonized and standardized um hopefully we will be able to shine with our ability to do data integration and harmonization and benefit the research community so I um I'm very grateful to my lab and and I have a small number of people listed here um but basically my whole Lab is very much into all these research and obviously um nothing is possible without the consortia we have been part of it's like a huge community that we benefited tremendously um and all these projects have a uh re source and service goal in mind hoping to generate data that will benefit everybody else so thank you so much for your attention thank you for the wonderful talk do you have any questions from students first thank you that was really cool um I'm wondering about the um your neural net models for the different cell types you had um you found that the features that were really important were transcription Factor binding sites or appeared to be um did different binding sites appear important for different cell types yes yeah so um for example like neurod is important for excited three neurons and uh um spi1 which is transcription Factor important for immune system it's only important for microa so each line here is the average for that specific cell type okay yeah that's really cool um and the model didn't really know which transcription factors were actually expressed in those cells the model is a model that input is the ccres that are important in each cell type and then the output you train the model to predict um a tax seek signal at base pair resolution so that's the model doesn't know anything about transcription Factor but the important positions in the input sequence are the ones that Bound by transcription factors very cool thank you yeah right other questions I'm just curious I you know I'm just curious about the metabolic diseases in uh in the liver that you're studying is it non-alcoholic Patty liver disease or you know what what diseases are we talking about um the the na Naf napin yes yeah non-alcoholic Patty litter liver disease yeah these are important you know that disease did not exist before 1980 basically it's a new disease because we eat to much check it basically fructose corn syrup yeah driven by the diet okay it's part of the obes much sugar yeah too much sugar too much diet yeah it's a man-made disease based on the on our diet yeah so it's an important one and you know over in adults over half of them supper from so it's huge so it's G to it's timely given all the interest in those in those kind of diseases and the Obesity crisis so it's a really good one and we could talk more about that yeah definitely yeah should okay I need to become an expert of these diseases okay heying congratulations on all the beautiful work it's really outstanding to see um I I wanted to ask you about the it's such a striking observation that the more kind of evolutionary constraint measures that you incorporate into the regulatory genome the more enrichment you see for gwas variant correct and then to contrast that with um everyone's trying to figure out what are the Target genes of these variants and it turns out out that genes under selection tend to not have eqtl and eqtl are a popular method to connect variants to genes right and so correct when you look to connect a gwos variant to a Target Gene you don't see lots of eqtl at gwos variant and do you think this observation of higher constraint in the regulatory landscape probably means it's not going to be any qtl all the time how do you how are we going to find the eqtls that's my question yeah so the thing is yeah I think qtl house has a really s bias and a lot of these are distal enhancers and you know it's difficult to connect them with um eqtl so I think these methods do have a Advantage if you see a enhancer that's very far away from genes and they're highly conserved is a good reason for them to be highly conserved in the melean lineage right in the most recent evolutionary time so I think they could totally add that are there online questions or Aon wants to ask a question ask um Jeffrey says what is the relationship between constraint binding sites and the selectivity or promiscuity of their cogni transcription factors for binding for example co-evolutionary effects co-evolutionary events you mean the co- Evolution between the transcription factors and their binding sides yes I think that's the question um relationship between constraint binding sides and the selectivity and the transion factor proteins themselves the proteins are hugely conserved yes the proteins are completely conserved like transcription factors if you look at the binding s uh The Binding DNA binding domain is a nearly 100% conserved in the protein it's the site that change quite a bit so I mean in terms of uh promiscuity of The Binding so even if the protein is conserved but how promiscuous or selective is it for its binding site because there are several transcription factors that have a a semi- overlapping transcription sites I guess I don't quite understand the question can you can you rephrase it a little bit yeah sure so basically the idea is that uh because some transcription factors uh they don't bind to you know like a single motive right there's some uh yeah so work like one TF could have two different motives exactly exactly and of course it's like on an affinity Spectrum so you can have like one transcription Factor it binds like in a very noisy way and so even if the site is uh is not is not constrained but maybe another transion Factor can still bind to that same site uh yeah yeah that's that's a really good question I mean we did not were not able to do this kind of detailed analysis we are actually doing it now but we still assume each transcription Factor has one binding mod Motif um it's it's quite rare for transcription factors to have distinct binding motifs like to have multiple we we we right now we we are studying like the competition between transcription factors I mean all of these sites I'm telling you are sites defined using chipseek data not sites purely with computational prediction so I'm not answering your question um on the point sorry um but what I'm saying is you what you are asking requires very detailed analysis and uh our paper did not go into these kind of details yeah thank you very much thank you all right another we have two other questions um on the autoencoder umap plots there seems to be some shared data points across different clusters is that the effects of unsupervised models so it's less precise or is it because they share same f um share functions yeah yeah um these ones um let me go to it so U we can look at the same plot together so for example like um um so if you look at the feto specific adult specific feto and adult shared and there are some some each one is a cc each dot is a cc so some of them are shared so um it's possible that the model are not um precise enough um you see the cell type specific ones they are more separate is because these ones are the colored ones that are specific to each cell type we specifically left out the ones here that are shared by two or more cell types in Gray and shared by all the brain cell types in Black we only took the colored portion to make this plot that's why they are much more separated does that kind of make sense did I answer question yeah did I answer your question yes okay thank you um second question one comment awesome talk I'm curious to know how much the environment such as diet and lifestyle would contribute towards the variation control versus disease how much this would alter due to population structure and do you expect this contribution of population structure to vary among different diseases yes these are the questions we are dying to get a glimpse into um we may not have enough power to answer these wonderful questions um this is like a pilot study and uh we will set up the infrastructure get the Kinks worked out and possibly you know we we will need more participants to answer these questions very um with with with statistical Reliance Reliance reliability so excellent questions I don't know the answers yet be great any other questions from the a audience um I really like the uh work about the uh chome BP net and uh that it's kind of like very uh I think it's very awesome intriguing to find that do important nucleotide selected by it kind of Highly like highlight some of the uh binding sides I wonder like in gener it seems like it's a um unsupervised or or I wouldn't unsupervised method it's like a method that predicting like a nucleotide without knowing what it's actually going on and based on what this prediction you'll find it's it's like indicating some binding sets I wonder like what some others um potentially important sites or known biology that these highlighted nucleotide also corresponding to yeah um that is a really good question I mean this example this is the the number one CC um in brain so obviously the signal is really strong like the number one in terms of open competent signal um we see like bits of things that do not like do not look like known transcription Factor binding motifs in other CCI as well um we we we we're trying to figure that out some of them correspond to like composite motifs between two TFS um there are some other we cannot decipher so so right now we're working with ano and jointly trying to define transcription Factor binding sites collectively using this kind of data using encode en code has like a thousand or so high quality chipseek not chipseek um attack seek and uh DNA seek data that's what we're in the process of working out um that goes first and then we're worried about what's left behind what they can do to to regulations so so these are the positions important for open comant so one conclusion we can make is The Binding of TFS are important for keeping a region open Comon but whether or not they are other signals like poly a stretch DNA shape I'm just thinking there are must be other biophysical signals as well as biological signals that could contribute to open Quon signal that's very interesting I'm looking forward to what you can find thank you Tom okay one final question okay um thanks for the wonderful talk so um my question is um more like kind of CCR usings um I think um first the first part of my question is like I want to ask like uh the lens of the CCR you define whether they are like 100 BP or 1,000 BP around um and another question that I want to ask like um because the CC basically will have a bunch of different transcription Factor inside it correct Bess inside it so U did you have observed that a longer CC tends to have uh are have a higher probability that it's going to regulate the gene expression compared to those shorter ccres that you define yeah that's a very good question so our cc is a bit by by Design um they are between 150 and 350 the bigger ones tend to be promoters promoters are more open competent um and uh um there is like for example like this this example like you can have 10 20 transcription Factor binding sites within one CCI we actually specifically studied them in terms of conservation if you look at our zomia paper has a panel on how they evolve it's it's actually quite interesting there a mixture of quickly evolving Bing sites versus not as quickly once it's like a mix of them in terms of evolutionary history um um but I mean we're still teasing out I mean they we don't see a strict correlation between the length and the regulatory potential if that's what you're asking um but but we do see a distinction between promoters enhancers promoters tend to be longer which makes sense they tend to be more open coent because you have um pre-initiation complex po two like occupying there and they tend to be like 350 loan at the cap yeah thanks thank you all right thank you everyone for wonderful discussions and let's thank um Dr Jing W again for wonderful talk thank you so much for making the talk
