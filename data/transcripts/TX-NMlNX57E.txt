um and then you know like since there I stayed in Boston I started my lab in 2016 and um and you know I've been funded mainly by nagri um so and yeah today like uh I'm running a mid-sized lab and you know we focus on engine regulation so so one thing that you know we like to do in my lab we really like to build computational methods so these are some of the matters that that we built since uh I started the lab and you know I know that you know we will have meetings later so I will not present all these tools you know we don't have the time but just want to give you some pointers so you know to drive discussions so so these are some of the tools that we developed you know one that you know I will briefly pre-sign this a tool to try to find Regions that are important uh in gene regulation integrating epigenomic and gene expression data it's called istock we've been also working with single cell data trying to reconstruct developmental trajectories using gene expression data and chromatin accessibility and you know it's a tool called stream and then you know we've been really active in creating tools for genome editing and try to create tools to design perturbation but as well to quantify perturbation so crisprits and you know crisper me um today is not in this slider to design perturbation chrispresso and is to quantify genome editing activity Crispers everything I would present today is a tool to dissect regulatory elements and Prime design is a tool for a new technology called Prime editing that you know is a really cool technology to precisely insert um in such condition substitution without double strand breaks and we're also excited you know to model transcription factors so we have you know two tools that we recently published one is called Motif Raptor that essentially allows you to understand which factor may be more influenced by genitive variants so integrate G was converting accessibility and RNA expression and a tool called graphimo that is a simple scanning tool like Fimo but instead of scanning linear genomes with scan recent graph genomes and and finally now we also really excited about new visualization techniques so we developed this tool for fun called single cell VR where you know if you buy this Google cardboard for 10 bucks you can see your in a single cell data set you know in visual reality and you can fly you know in your umap and it's just a fun you know website and these are all published so I would not spend too much time and all I would just focus on on few of these tools so today I I want you know I have two segments and in the first segment I was talking about crispr genome editing how can we use this Technologies to dissite functional element in the genome and the second part of the talk I will present some unpublished work where we use single cell data to build um regulatory Maps using graph and bad things so let me start with the first one so we are really excited about you know understanding genome function You know despite we have the full sequence of the genome you know in 2001 we had the full draft but was not until this year that we have the full sequence but yeah there's still a lot of things that we don't know like we you know for example if you're in the coding space you know you you understand you know X on the intron you know you know like all these things are are working much better but if you are in the non-coding space if I like one region that is outside the coding space sometimes you know we don't fully understand what these sequences are are working so so that the the big question is like how can we learn you know to to read and understand this non-coding part of the genome and you know one reason why we want to to do that is that uh first of all 98 of the genome is non-coding and 80 percent depending on which size you use as some biochemical activity we don't know if all of this is functional and there are like debates but still you know there are like some some by chemical activity you measure but one important thing is that many of the diseases associated variants are in this space so it's really important to try to understand what's going on in this part of the genome so one thing that you know is also important to think about if you want to understand the genome and you know to me it was about the Linus a computer signed this this was one of the reason why I wanted to transition to computational biology and you know the question is like Oh Come you know our cell at the same DNA but they do really different things they activate different programs but the program is the same right so so this was really like puzzling to me and you know one thing I learned you know during my post talk is that that actually you know you have the code but this code can be activated organized in different way and you know one of these the key ideas that the way this DNA is organizing the chromatin is really important this chromatin is really Dynamic it's not static so so this is partially explained this and there are like different things that can control the organization the chromatin like you know the nucleosomes you know the DNA medilation and distal modification and many other things that I don't have in this slide but so with these things in mind you know like you know we know like some of the actors right that you know may be important in in controlling this program and the gene expression but the genome is still really large right so how do we follow how do we explore these three billion base pair in the genome so so what do we need so one thing that we need is like we have a way to prioritize you know we need to highlight you know some some region of the genome and if you really want to understand the function the best way super tool so and for this we have like a different Gene editing Technologies and this leads us to understand that we can iterate in this in this Paradigm so Twilight you know as I mentioned there are like multiple ways one really effective way um to to highlight the important part of the genome is to use for example uh chromatin accessibility or some modification so if you have not heard about this this concept you know the DNA is dropped around nucleosome and you know these have you know particular tail and this style can be modified and you know one thing that people have described is that depending on which modification you have in this style you can actually potentially infer the function of that part of the genome for example you know if a Genus transcribed you would see this h36 trimethylation and you know if the gene is repriced maybe there are particular Mark in the promoter and you know there are a lot of marks that people have described one that you know is really nice and important in this exploration is uh is this h327 as a dilation then Mark this region that are called and answers and these are regions that you would not find you know easily if you don't have a white or a light so so these are region that can control gene expression from distance and you know can fine tune the activation and many many of the variants are actually falling in this region so it's really important to you know have a way to map and thanks to roadmap epigenomics and then code they we have like this this um you know tracks for you know several cell types and and then we know we can we can focus our exploration and you know for this you know like um you know my lab has developed this tool that can use this marker also other Mark you know this eye stack that is published so I want to spend a lot of time but really I level you know in our pipeline what we're trying to do is trying to leverage this idea of variability so if if you have this specific programs means that you know maybe you're using this Mark in different ways in each cell type so you know in this in this panel here imagine that the rows are the cell types so what we do is like we we assess you know a way uh that you know without calling Peaks uh what what are the regions that are most valuable for this Mark and then give this give us a way to you know focus in the genome to say like you know these are the regions that are more dynamic in the in the genome and then you can still you know go after you know Supply specific mechanism and the transcription factors and then using RNA to see if this Factor are you know indeed expressed in the cell type that you know where we predict the activity so this was you know just one one way that you know we proposed many other groups of proposed ways to do this but you know this is like a potential tool that you might want to consider to highlight region the the other thing you know like I mentioned before you know I like per tour so now you have you know a candidate that the regions this can be based on you know like chromatin marks can be based on you know Snips from from G was or you know eqtl but you know Gene I did in technology manager being around for a while what made you know crispr so like disruptive is that this system is so easy to to program and you know if you're not familiar with this system there are like two parts so there is this cas9 protein and then there is this RNA that is called guider na where you know one part of the spider and nine essentially can be a synthesized and and can be directed to almost anywhere you know any location in the genome and you know but by simple complementary rules you can essentially program this sequence and deploy and you know go and essentially great double stream break so so one you know small thing is that you know the fact that you can go almost anywhere is that there is something called Palm that you know this short sequence here that you know you should match in order for this system to activate but recently people have proposed actually why to relax this constraint so you can essentially perturb almost any region in the genome and what happened you know after you introduced this double stream break so there are like different repair Pathways in the cell two common one one is called Nano molecules and joining they will create small incessional deletion and the other one is called homologous direct repair where if you provide a small um Donald template so this pathway that is less efficient sometimes can essentially resolve this double stream Break by using this template and then what happens is you can essentially introduce whatever modification you want in that region but this is like way less efficient so this one is more efficient and you know this is a great tool to go there and do this genomic vandalism as you know George Church sometimes refer to this but it's really nice to disrupt you know for example description Factor binding or you know snips and you know there are also that the nice things about this system is that people have evolved you know uh the system in really creative way for example one way is that you can for example remove you know this capability of Cliff the DNA and you know you can modify the cast nine and you know this is called deadcast9 so it cannot cleave anymore and then you fuse other you know modifiers that for example repress or activate you know locally the genome and you know these are called crisprio crisparai and there are like so many variants to you know of this enzyme but the idea is that you know you can reprise for example an answer or you can create an announcer you know wherever you want in the genome and so you know now like you know I introduce you know one way do I light one way to birth so what can we understand you know with these Technologies so one thing that you know like um I did as apostle I was really lucky to collaborate with Daniel Bauer and start talking and they they are they are really like um focusing trying to understand what development diseases and they are really interested in in trying to find ways to core sickle cell disease so in in 2013 we um we published this paper where they were studying this Gene called bc11a and in particular there is an announcer this Gene that is really Supply specific and this this this Gene you know has this function to repress fetal amoglobin so as you know like you know we have different kind of hemoglobin so we have the the one that is expressed as the fetal stage and the one that is expressed at the adult stage so one thing that you know like has been observed some people have variance and you know like they still Express the fetal amoglobin the you know the dull stage and these people are you know like have better prognosis you know if they get sickle cell because they have like a backup you know like uh hemoglobin so in this paper we show that in a few delete this announcer for this Gene that is a strong repressor for fidelamoglobin you can actually reactivate you know fetal among women and this is like you know a potential way to to cure this disease so so this was you know done at that time with with Talon you know crispr was still not so popular so we shop the entire you know an answer and we show that you know this was a key element for for this Gene in 2015 we made you know the you know the realization is like do you really need you know the the full length answer maybe you know there are like specific parts of this and answer that are important so we design one of the first crispr tiling screen and yeah I will present you know the the idea better but the idea is like you can create several perturbation you try to find this the smallest you know bars that you really need and you know indeed we found you know this paper that you really need a single bind inside to shut down there's an answer and this was a binding site for a factor called got a one and also there was another Factor tall one nearby and then in 2019 there was this new technology called um by his editing and you know like actually this was you know another but in this paper we showed that actually if you take a single perturbation you know this element and you modify human hematopoieties and cell you can actually when they differentiate you have a way you know like to essentially um reactivate feed a lamoglobin so the idea is like you you may take style from the passion you modify you check if you're modifying these some other ways and sell right without of targets and then you reinfuse and and the idea is like you know when they repopulate your blood system you know they they should you know they should have this fetal amoga been active right so this idea that you know seems like reasonable you know was like was actually uh really translation so there are like now several clinical trials you know one you know led by Daniel Bauer and also from companies and this was you know one of the first demonstration that you know if you combine genetics functional genomics and these Technologies you can create therapists that you know actually are working so you know it's really exciting in a moment you know like where you know you see the combination of computational methods with you know like experimental strategies and now like you know this this is like one of the first but there are a lot of many more things that we can discover in the genome so so and and this brings me to this uh this idea of this crispr tally screen so you can think you know like we have these new tools that are really like easy to to deploy so you know if you want to discover you know the part that are important that you know you can play you know kind of Battleship right so there are like few things that you want to discover and now you can just deploy this perturbation sometimes you know you eat the rice pot sometimes you don't find anything so and you know like the the cool thing is that you can be smart you know in in this exploration because different technology have different perturbation range some neighbor to be now like larger region one to get B other step or two you know individual nucleotides so one thing I propose on my R35 was what about if we combine these Technologies where we start with this low resolution scanning you know using crispr eye and Chris Pary and then we do like maybe cas9 perturbation that you know introduce you know time by spare you know elements and then you can go find a resolution using um base editing so this is something that you know we are currently like um exploring I mean I want to presign you know some of our work on on this front and you know Chris bertali screen as you know uh have been already used like by not just our lab but many labs are using this study screen these are just three examples of this style screen one is this pc11a you know uh story I told you where we used you know the cast nine perturbation and we were you know using this uh an answer the purpose was this and answer this section and you know that time we proposed Aiden Marco model to do that and then Jesse angry synthetic London not just it will probably present those three or they did the crispr ice cream where the idea was to discover and answers you know for the mick Jean and you know they propose um moving average and t-ties and then the Alex Marson lab you know they use crispr eye with the idea to discover and answer or you know potential can by reactivating them and they use you know this this price system and you know they use a simple strategy so so figure a little bit deeper you know for the general idea of this crispritating screen the way it works in that design stage you have to to think about what what I what I'm trying to pursue right and I'm perturbing like for example this star region for a gene or you know you might want to perturb the coding region of a gene so this essentially will dictate you know what kind of you know perturbation you want to use in the scale the experiment the way it works you after you design your perturbation you will infect yourself you know you can do antiviral Construction in a way that you know um you want to have one perturbation per cell you know like that's the the typical setup you know you can play you know with different way to obtain that and after you do that you know you can have like a phenotype that you might want to study for example can be self viability can be like you know as I mentioned before the reactivation of fetal amoglobin or can be anything that you can imagine with fox or you know with other Technologies but the key idea is that you can essentially create groups you know the simplest setup you create two groups one that have your phenotype you can call the Eye Group and one that doesn't have your phenotype or you call the Law Group so now what you can do is like you you have these cells right the one that responded the one didn't respond you sequence and then you you can essentially try to create a date ball where you you read out which battery base so this sgrna is the particular perturbation that you introduced and then you can essentially count how many times this perturbation was in my eye group you know the one for my phenotype how many times was in the Law Group and given that you design you know this perturbation you know where they map in the genome right so you can you know imagine that you mark back this perturbation maybe this will Mark here this will appear so you can kind of create a signal right and then based on the Richmond of this signal you can discover which part was Associated to your phenotype and you know like just to you know provide a little bit more detail right and you know if if it's not clear feel free to stop me raise your hand and say Luca you know can you explain better um but you know we are here right so we have a region you know we we introduce our crisper perturbation we sort so what do we sequence you know let me provide you a little bit more detail so the way it works you know when you oh yeah let me Chase oh okay oh sorry guys oh yeah I would hold on I'll go yeah yeah maybe yeah maybe you can try to memorize you know like just keep in your mind so what what you think you know you introduce this you know like this this construct that contains the guide you know you see this guy during night I get transcribed and then you know with the customized we're going the side you know in the Target it will modify and then you know there's this plural that you know it's like something to select only the style that said this virtual bash but the nice thing is that whatever you introduce apart from the from the guide is the sign so you can design primers around this so you will read uh you have a simple way to read out which perturbation you know you you have and then you know like you can derive a score and you know the simplest one can be just allowed to uh for change of your account in the eye population the low population right that's you know the simplest thing that you can do so that that's essentially a tiny screen right it's really simple setup however you know like you know things are simple but when you analyze them they're always you know problems so you know really I level you know we are here right so we sequence you know like and these are you know our first Q file where we you know see the abundance of you know the guide in different conditions and then there are a lot of you know challenges what we want is something like this so we want to have kind of a denized version of our signal so each kind of point is like one vector bash and so we want to deny the signal and you know like you know this can be positive and negative things that are positive may increase your phenotype things that are negative are decreasing your phenotype then some kind of you know statistical ties to say well you know if you're around here this is nice you know maybe this is something that you you should focus so you know to do that we developed this tool called crisper Surf and this was developed by a PhD student in my lab Jonathan soon and um so the way we approach this problem was we can think about this Christopher perturbation as a convolution you know and the convolution and you know you you know imagine that there's some underlying you know function of the genome you can Envision that you know if it's red is increasing your phenotype if it's blue it's decreasing so you know you have positive and negative signal so when you like uh try to infer you know this this this functional association with your phenotype you measure this with a tool that can be like a gen editing tool and what you you imagine it's not the way you you know that the truth is like the truth that you know is convolved by you know this this this editor so and we want to to go back and you know I will try to like motivate you know this this intuition a little bit more so the first thing that we need to think about is that what is the actual resolution that we have so the first thing is that if you have a cas9 you know like um so as I mentioned before you do double strand break and then you do like short indole and you resolution here can be around 7 base pair so you can number two a single no good type fuse cars you know crispride with paray based on previous previous literature here you might put 200 or you know 500 or sometime even 1kb so that's the actual resolution that you have with this tool and you don't modify the dn9 okay so so now with this in mind you know like what's going on here so imagine that you have a function right that you want to measure that is like the underlying you know genomic signal right associated with your phenotype so if you will have the perfect tool can be like you know um just a stick you know like a discrete Delta direct you know you know if you want to formalize this and you can imagine you can slide this thing on this function and you will get you know assuming you have no noise no Distortion you will reconstruct this you know like at the right resolution but we don't have this right so we have you know like maybe something like this so when we slide you know like in imagine that you do a tiling screen in all the position what you do is kind of convolving your signal and you know you get a smoothed version of your of your scene and then if you're crisper eye another perturbation is much larger so this operation is called convolution and people have been you know studying this for several years in an image in an audio and many other you know application so if you formalize this you have a convolutional uh operation where you have like the genomic regulatory signal the crispr you know Cardinal you know we can call that some noise because we always have noise and then this is what we observe this is our observed data so now can we like given the observed data and given that you know the average profile what is the most likely signal that you can you know like um Rigo strike so there are like so many ways to solve this so the noise can be multiple things you know one can be like sequencing guiders another thing can be like potential you know batch of fights you know because you you need to do replicates and then you know another source of noise can be different sequence in depth that you know may like um essentially not um essentially allow you to measure all the guides all the time or maybe when you do this transfection you know the inspection is not always the same so some guys are more expressed than others so there are a lot so here I'm just hiding all these things in one term but the noise you know can capture some of this uh so these are the things that we understand but there may be other one that you know I I I I don't know and so so the way we do this you know there is one thing called generalized loss so and uh so essentially that's you know there are like many more details but just want to give you the intuition here so so one thing that we do here is like um why is like your observed signal by the ER this the coefficient you want to learn that are you know this genomic you know like Association you want to discover in X essentially we we uncalled you know this this um perturbation profile plus the location is as I mentioned before so in reality x is like the the product of two matrices because you know you know you cannot perturb every single region so you know we try to essentially account for that and then you know this generalize loss of formulation this D you know like what we do um essentially there is one thing called fuse uh fuse penalty that essentially try to instead of you know like in the normal L1 where you you say you know this beta cannot grow like too much it would penalize with that here what we try to do like we tried to minimize the difference between consecutive data so you don't want these things to jump up and down too much and the intuition behind that is that in an answer often you have blocks of you know regulatory Island regulatory region like imagine a binding site right you have 10 to 20 base pair that are all you know like together so with this fuse penalty we're trying to like when we try to propose solution we're trying to propose solutions that have destruction right we don't want the vanilla died in the middle of nowhere so and you know in in our experience this seems to to work well um so that that's what we do I mean there are like more details here that are described in the Bible but this is the intuition of why we use this framework so we tried this in multiple screen the nice thing about this formalization you can apply a different resolutions that we're using S9 in this crisper eye and crispy so these are the three screen I had you know as light before the nice thing that we we saw is that we recover all the validated elements that they have in the screen but we find also new elements we didn't entice because you know like you know like we didn't have the system but one cool thing that you know we showed in the papers that the new element that we find are decorated with you know chromatin marks or chromatin accessibility that suggests that you know they may be like functional elements and you know they were not essentially discovered with the previous methods because you know they didn't have the the power um and then you know one one cool thing that we did in collaboration with the Bauer lab was to do like uh a screen where we used two technologies to Target the same elements at the same time to compare you know the resolution so this again was you know this bc11 region we target multiple people elements and then you know long story short what we learned in the year is that so these are three elements that are both you know significant based on our tool for crab and this crisp our eyes sorry you have like much lower resolution as despite the business of the perturbation range is much larger and if you compare the top one with the bottom one because nine you know it can really like you know get in a smaller part of you know this an answer so you know it's really nice and also can potentially Target elements that have you know this opposite effect whereas you know with cas9 that you know you have just epigenetic perturbation it's really hard to have in this dual you know uh sign the other thing that you know it's not surprising but it's good to keep in mind if you want to do the screen if you use epigenetic perturbation uh you may not see any effect in coding regions whereas in a few percent with genetic perturbation probably you will mess up you know the protein badly and you will see a strong effect and then around the TSS again we see a similar Trend you know the cost nine is a little bit more um higher resolution so we build you know our interactive website also government line and you know the idea is like we want to make this simple so you know people can design this perturbation and you know they can even fine-tune depending on you know future you know editors and then you have this kind of Step by Step you know process where you can de-convolve the signal and you know below you see that raw signal and then on top you know what we reconstruct with this with this framework and then there is like a statistical test that tells you like which region you should focus and you know it's all interactive but we also have a common line for people that do really large screen where maybe a website is not the appropriate tool thank you and then you know like where we go from here right so so far you know like I show you like screen based on cost nine and Chris Craig's parade but you know that genome I didn't feel this coin so fast so they are you know like creating new tools like every you know few months so presenting you know these new places but now we have these base editors that you know they use uh Nick case with you know some the Army knives for example domain and you know this can introduce precise substitution and more recent Tool uh from the David Lu lab um it's called Prime editing it's a really complex system where they use revives transcriptase you know to like introduce a you know essentially whatever you want in that region is also based on a Nick case cost nine so with this editor you know it can be a little bit more ambitious and you know just really precisely try to understand small region right and you know you can try to is a really small part and really try to to you know um recover a more detailed version that you know if you delete element like with customize so I presented this approach one thing that we are exploring now is like you know one thing that you know like code name you know crispr clear is not publish so here you know the idea is that instead of you know measuring the guide abundance right as I showed you before what about we mentioning like the their leads that we create and then we try to essentially correlate their list to the phenotype because you know like all the things I presented before they imagine just the guide presence right so you don't actually know what is happening at that region but if you actually design primers to Vision you know to to quantify what are their lists you might understand much better you know like what what is up so you know it's not anymore trying to resolve what each guide is doing but you can actually measure for this we created this this tool you know and see I'm running out of time so I will go a little bit faster but this tool called crispresso Doom is a tool to actually quantify um genomedic activity so and you know you can use for any editors so the key idea you know here is that image you're modifying this region you design primers you amplify this region and then you sequence and you know this is called usually amplicon sequencing and then you know this tool allows you it's also a website you know you can just drag and drop your first Q file so create a really long plot uh and you know report and there are like many outputs the the two one that are important for this expression one tells you like on average how many IDs do you have like how much are you you know how efficient is your system the other one is a table like this but you know it's probably the the best way to really see what what is happening you know what what are you doing to your region and this essentially shows you that reference and then all their lists that you create with their promotion right so now that you have these tables what can you do so you can start to compare you know like population right so as I mentioned before you know maybe about population of cells respond to your phenom by population that didn't respond to your phenotype so by comparing the proportion of their leaves you can try to reason about which part which particular insertion deletion substitution are functional and then try to think about oh maybe you know there is a binding site for a photo but here you have this direct observation of that list so it's not like guessing that you know maybe this is the region so so this is like we are building now like computational tools to take these tables and try to like have a nucleotide resolve in our signal where you know we can say you know this particular nucleotide this this effect in a similar to what you know you do now with MP array but you know like nbra is like much easier to do this or this you know you have to like build all these tools and you know like and create all the products so and yeah this tool is available online and now like you know I'm really excited as um Allah mentioned to be part of this New Consortium where we don't go after any more two elements we're trying to reason about individual variants and I'm directing a center you know called characterization center with several other um bi Daniel bow again let's try and reach a sharpwood and some guy Benjamin Steinberg Bernard Lee where we're using base editing to essentially pursue individual variants that people have uh um essentially highlighted by G was or summary statistics sorry jiwas or qtl or other studies and really try to understand you know by perturbing them like if they're really like in a functional right so you know we do like instead of doing fine mapping with statistical matters we just go there you just go to all these variants and we just see which one is important so I see it's like 4 45 so maybe I can try to wrap up in five minutes okay I would be a little bit more um quick in five minutes I just wanted to tell you like my lab is also really excited about single seller size any these are all unpublished work but you know we have preprint for three of them so one you know I would briefly present this called Simba we have a tool called Megatron that you can use to model lineage um data single cell expression data where you have also lineage barcode and we also work in velocity proposing a probabilistic framework with uncertainty and then also we we are developing this method called dictis to reconstruction developmental Network and so if you are curious you know we will have time later so in the last five minutes I want to just give you like some ideas about this work called Simba this is like a a work led by dongshan uh postdoc in my lab in collaboration with Adam Laredo angry and Michael Vineyard Adam is from meta AI like um Facebook so here you know like as you know think of phenomics you know it's really an exciting area and we have a size that you know allows you to imagine in single cell expression of thousands of genes commonly accessibility methylation protein level so many other things this is also fast evolving so it's a really exciting area and the goal of this regulatory maps that you know I mention of Simba is like you take all this measurement and you know we want to build these Maps where you know they they look like you know where you have now in many single cell paper but that the key difference here is that the dots are the cells as you know normally you map but you have also dots for the features so you may have like in a DOT for genes motifs and Peaks so you can essentially reason about you know the function or the relationship between different features depending on where they are in these Maps so for example you can say if you're in this such State this Factor are important and you know this Factor close to this Peaks and these Peaks are close to this Gene so maybe they form you know regulatory circuits so that's the idea of this regulatory Maps even though I don't have time I will just skip some slide so the the way we are building this regulatory map is using some technique from borrow from natural language processing where you know you have language you have text and you want to teach like a machine to understand text and the idea there is that you can take word or sentences and you associate vectors and you create spaces where you know the relationship you know the distance between words may you know like represent some some semantic or some for example you know one you know classic things is like if you use this word to buy technique you know to create a queen it's like the king vector and then you just add woman minus mine you just get the queen so so this you know techniques are really powerful and you know this embedding spaces are really like you know you can learn a lot about the context of the so the idea is like can we do the same with you know like um sequences and you know like a measurement from single side so so the idea is like can we do this kind of maybe chromatin tweets for you know pick can tweet and say Hey you know I'm present in this cells and these are the amount if so so the way you know we do this we use a technique called graph embedding so I will skip some slide so so and maybe I will just show you this and maybe one vignette and then we can end so the idea is like you take all the Single Cell measurement that you have and then you try instead of doing The Classy things where you do clustering or you know try to align these matrices you just build a graph of all the measurement that you have so in this graph you have the cells that you measure and now you can say you know if you have a gene Express you get an edge if you have a peak you create an edge if a beakers are a particular TF or camera you get an edge so this graph as it is is not really helpful so what you do like you you embed this graph so so what you do is like you create um a vector for each for each you know of your node and then you create this space and this spaces the property that you know you have the size but you have also all the other features that you know are they are credit and then by reasoning on the the proximity of this you know we show like and these are pre-print but I'll say happy to talk with you we show that you can essentially find without doing any clustering important marker for the population you can find relevant description factors and as well you know regulums and you know all of this is based on the proximity of the bonds in the space so there is no clustering there is no other you know other procedures and you know just show you this maybe vignette here a single one where you know this is like um a data set where we have you know multi-modal data so you have gene expression and grounding accessibility measuring the sign cell so the graph looks like this where you have decile connected to genes cell connected to Peaks Peaks connected to chimers or TF so we apply this procedure and now you can build these Maps where you can embed just the cells and you can just do the clustering if you want you know like using standard tools you can have cells and genes or you can have cell genes for different Peaks all in the same month and then we have you know a way using this technique to find the important features that Define the space without the clustering and then based on this procedure then we can reason about you know like for example you find the most important you have then you can ask what other relevant such States for this TF what are the Peaks where this TF you know may be important and you know just to and you know just to show one important in our boy and Powerful you know um approach that you can use in a few of these maps for example in these Maps you have embedding for genes and Motif transcription Factor Motif so you can for example sort all the description Factor based on the distance between the embedding of one factor and um and The Motif a few rank all of them you will find all the master Regulators for the system and you know like this is just a simple proximity operation and then you know you can reason about pigs engines nearby you can find a regular so we show that this can be a supply for you know batch correction or in other tasks I think it's a new way to think about single cell modeling and I'm excited you know to see where this will go but I'm happy to chat about this so I will skip the conclusion so I just wanted to acknowledge my lab and you know um Adam from meta AI that you know really helped us with this graph and binding and Michael and jayang that help in this project all the LA member and my funding sources and I will stop here with that Quest thank you thank you so any questions yeah really really nice talk curious about for some of the tiling I guess the the nucleus kind of conventional crisper tiling screens I think different groups of found an issue where guides that are you know a little bit proximal to the start of an Exon can make these larger deletions yes and and then those have usually much stronger effects than you know on the perturbing enhancer or something so is there a way to correct for that in this kind of model or can you get it from the sequencing the was it the clear yeah you know like in in the model that we propose we don't go right for that because we've been focusing more on an answer element so this is something I didn't explore but yeah maybe like by reading that leaves I think would be much easier to go right for that you know the common base you don't see right so you have to then use predictive models and you know assume that you have longer delicious so I I don't think it's easy but for that little bison thing you know there are potential ways to to provide for that but you know it's not included in in this current framework and how good are the predictive models in a different groups of developed models that will predict the the natj or the you know the mmej outcomes of individual guides based on the the Pam minus four are those predictive enough to be useful in this game yeah yeah I mean it depends you know we applied a little bit with that and one thing is that this model was trained in particular cell types so if you have a cell type that you know is similar probably they are more effective and also we we're observing us sometimes you know you know for the top allele you know like actually they they seems to work well the order may be off right but you know if you if you just ignore the actual frequency you know it's like you know the top five usually you find things that you know the model would predict if you want to reason about the actual editing this is something that I don't think you know they are you know yet that right maybe we need a little bit more diet but if you want to reason about potential outcomes I think you know they are effective okay yeah great very cool also if there's any questions online okay any oh any other questions here so I've got a question um in in the convolution d convolution uh part of your talk um did that give you any insights into ways that you can improve the decaths assays a crispr eye crispr a in terms of maybe density of tiling or increased sequence depth what are the parameters that improve your ability to De convolute yeah yeah actually yeah we in the Bible we actually investigated this a little bit before we did like some down sign playing and so if you crisp or eye actually you don't need many guys they are like you know these things are you know so powerful and so I think you know like if I remember correctly that I you know what we were suggesting is like every tactic by Spire probably is good enough and then you know sequencing is important but it's not you know the I think you know if you are like aim to to have like a representation of 300 per guide you know probably it's okay for cas9 for base editing I think you know you need to like tile you know much time answer so the denser you go like the better and then when we did this you know we were using ngg so you know you have like some malls where you know there is not much you can do but now like you know bankless diver that you know is in our Center propose this spry and you know SPG where you can essentially tile monster everywhere but you have less efficience a little bit less so you know just a compromise so yeah what we learned is like sequencing that is not super important for count base for the lead base you know we're invested in this now is really important because you you may want to go after rare at least they can be still really like um associated with your phenotype but for come base you know you know you don't have the resolution to go after those things right you just say yeah there is something here but you don't know which no good time um yeah okay thank you other other questions okay let's thank Luca again
