uh thank you m and Kimi for the invitation and thanks Jun for the kind introduction um yeah so I am now at the company the name of the company is gv20 Therapeutics so some of you might wonder whether this has anything to do with Google Venture um unfortunately it doesn't when we started the company in 2016 the the core technology was crisper screens my lab started using crisper screens for oncology and immune ology studies in 2014 um and we also developed many algorithms for developing more efficient crisper screens and for um analyzing the high surut sequencing data to get hits from crisper screens and so when we started this company um the broad Institute crisper screen technology platform is called Achilles Hill project uh so we were trying to see whether there's another name we can say like cancer vulnerability uh so in the Chinese is acupuncture point there are some uh acupuncture point on the back of the spine like on the spine from the tailbone is GV one and two and three all the way up and on the top of the head is gv20 uh by so we are trying to use genomics and computation to find cancer vulnerabilities um so let me start the talk with a question do you know the to selling cancer drug in 2022 um yeah it's ENT pd1 drug from Merk right Kuda right it's the yeah number one and of course uh BMS also sell a very similar drug of Divo and um Ro sells a related drug anti pdl1 and so together these three drugs sold for over $ 35 billion doar in Revenue so what are the conventional approach to discover a drug like anti- pd1 or anti pdl1 the process usually works like this um it's from the target to the mechanism to the drug so first you have to know there's a gene called a pd1 you need to understand its function or the mechanism so pd1 is a gene that's highly expressed on the te- cells and it interacts with uh pdl1 on the antigen presenting cells and this pair of interaction makes the t- cell in a dysfunctional stage a state therefore you can develop an antibody either against the pd1 or pdr1 to block this interaction and therefore then when the te- cells are activated when the t- cell receptor recognize the cancer cell as nonself then the pd1 antibody can maintain T cell in a constant uh activated stage or maintain the energy the the activity of the te- cells so overall this is a pretty long and expensive process you have to understand the gene know this function before you can develop a drug but do you know that um cancer patient in their tumors already make anti pd1 anti pdr1 antibodies um this is actually the hypothesis when um we um are taking to uh develop in the company and so in recent years there are increasing realization in the tumors there are small lymph nodes and so in there um the tumor has the the dendritic cells are presenting the tumor antigen to our immune system and so this tertiary lymphoid structure these tiny lymph nodes are proliferating t- cells and B cells um to against the tumor antigen um especially we're interested in B cells so these B cells in the patient tumors in these little lymph nodes they can recognize the relevant tumor antigen it can get activated and then gradually evolve to optimize antibodies again against the tumor antigen and then Mount attack against the tumor unfortunately even though some of these patients are making perfectly good anti-tumor antibodies they are insufficient to really defeat the tumors and there are two reasons for this the first is that they don't make enough so you can imagine when you have a war just having a small group of good soldiers are insufficient you really need a whole Army of good soldiers uh so that the amount is one thing the second is that when the antibody is still on the B cells or on the plasma cells the the the the B cells themselves can still go through a process to shift the FC and so if you look at the antibody the fa the Fab region recognize the tumor antigen but the FC region they call out a different immune help so when the antibody is uh in a B cell is a naive B cell it makes IGM antibody when it's activated it makes the IGG antibody but then the cyto Kine environment in the tumor can induce the B cell to shift from a IGG antibody to an IG antibody and we believe once the antibody is a IGA antibody it's no longer tumor killing it's actually even tumor protective so our hypothesis was that normally IGA antibody actually appears in the mucosal tissues like your airwave and your GI track because the air you breathe from outside the food you eat from outside clearly contain nonself things and there's no point to get your alarm system to get your immune system alarmed against these food or and attack them and so once the we we hypothesize this IGA antibody that's lining your gut tissue is actually suppressing the nearby immune system and therefore um when the cancer cell in you know in a tumor you know cancer cell never do anything Den Noble they always learn something from stem cells from other cells and so cancer cell realize that if it's actually producing the cyto kind the B cells can shift the antibody from IGG to an IGA and then this piece of tumor will look like a piece of food to the immune system and then your immune system wouldn't attack it right you become protumor so the way we came up with the H hypothesis was to look at the tcga data so in the uh the amount of B cells in the T usually if you have more B cells is good but the percentage of IgA antibody is actually bad when you have more IGA the patient actually do worse we we then also checked the literature um there was some earlier work from Michael karim's SL to show this and later on there was a special transcriptomic work um to um from uh um death Mar Wolf's group they also show that basically the B cells are matured in this tertiary lympho structure and then through the fiberblast tract it will migrate to the tumor Niche and if the the B cells going to that location is producing IGG antibody like this one then the adjacent cancer cells are more apoptotic whereas if it's producing IGA antibodies then the nearby uh cancer cells are no longer being killed by the B cells and antibodies and so then we thought oh okay so the patient are trying they're making antibody but they're not making enough and then very quickly the the tumor also is forcing the B cell to shift the uh FC to the wrong FC then it stops uh killing the tumor therefore what if we just directly give patient antibodies because if you give antibody as a protein it cannot actually shift FC it only happens on the B cells so if we give the patient enough of the antibody with the right those with the right format then this could be very powerful Therapeutics and that's kind of the approach GB 20 is taking to uh develop our Therapeutics where do we get these antibodies we are getting them from a tumor profiles rnac profiles so nowadays It Only Takes Two like two $300 to do the RNA seek of a tumor and when you sequence the RNA you don't just sequence the cancerous cells you also sequence the infiltrating B cells in there and um the B cells are also making the RNA that eventually produce the anti or translate into the antibody the only thing is that um in order you know like B cells have only two copies of the DNA but it can produce you know billions of different type of antibodies because it goes through a vdj recombination process but once it creates this hypervariable sequence to recognize potential antigens then it's no longer mappable to the reference genome and so when people do RNA seek the very first step of data analysis is to look at the RNA seek reads and try to map them to the reference genome and all the antibody sequences get thrown out as unmappable garbage as a computational biologist you know we take pride in collecting or in picking out gold from garbage and so um we were thinking you know this V digit Rec combination when it's translated into protein the V sequence and J sequence they have some amino acid sequence patterns and so we try to look at all those unmappable reads and try to translate them into different frames and ask which one of them contains some patterns that they are coming from a B cell from the V or J sequence and if so especially for Paradigm sequence you might have one end that mapped to either V or J the other end is like unmappable then we try to kind of assemble them together by overlapping the reads and so we can then assemble out the sequence uh into antibodies on average from each tumor RNA SE say in tcga we can get a few thousand antibodies from the the tumors so we did a comparison to say well what if we just do tumor BCR sequencing this is actually pretty expensive essay to do BCR sequencing is probably like a$ thousand doll but you can also do RNA sequencing then run this trust algorithm that we developed um and so we saw that we are not able to assemble all the the uh BCR sequence instead we are getting the really abundant ones that are clono expanded therefore are more likely to be recognized in tumor antig and so then in 2019 we published this paper in nature genetics um this was actually dealing with bulk tumor profiles since then uh we have published another study um even if you do single cell RNA seek but without specifically amplifying the vdj region if you're using the five Prime uh 10x genomics kit um just regular 10x study we can still use this trust algorithm to assemble the TCR and the PCR sequence from the single cell data anyhow the first author of The 2019 paper um decided to join the company so we started collecting tumor profiles and then just run this trust algorithm and so we have like tens of thousands of tumors and then we have over a 100 million antibodies that we computationally extracted from the patient tumors and so we were kind of thinking what are we going to do with these antibodies and you know so one day we thought oh maybe we can use AI to predict the targets for these antibodies um also we we we later also realized using this approach we can tell which Target are potentially more disease relevant and in this case cancer relevant and so later on we call this approach simultaneous Target evaluation and antibody Discovery so um let me intuitively explain to you roughly how we use AI to make the predictions um let's think about the IM image analysis you know AIW has really played a very big role uh in recent years um so in order for AI from say Google to differentiate the image from a dog or a cat or tiger or a lion what you need to do is to feed this AI labeled individual pictures of cats and dogs and so on and you have to have sufficient number of pictures right from different angles from you know different uh individual animals and so over time the AI can automatic Ally learn the features that can tell dog apart from a cat or a lion and so this is automatically learned and so for us this is actually a pretty easy question we are dealing with a much much harder question so imagine you have a zoo and before you go to a zoo you go to the website and you can see uh say uh London Zoo have the following animals Tokyo Zoo have different animals San Diego zo have a different animals and so on supposedly on the website they don't tell you what the animals look like you just know okay the zoo has these animals what you can look at are pictures taken by tourists who visits that Zoo um and they don't specifically label what animal each picture belong to um but at least you know that these pictures coming from the London Zoo are are all pictures for the the animals in that Zoo if we only look at a single zoo we have no way of telling what animals look like you know which type how however if you have this unlabeled picture but sufficient number of zoos that are more or less you know very different um then what you can say is uh well let's look at all the zoos that have lions and then look at all their pictures do they have something in common which are absent in the zoos that don't have Lions how about tigers you know look at all the zoos that have tigers what do they have in common that's absent in the zoos that don't have tigers how about zebra you know uh Panda and like every animal and so at the end if you are learning this correctly all the animals need to match on all the zoos you have right then you know that this AI is working but for us to learn you know to to know that we are learning this correctly um at least in machine learning is by cross validation imagine we leave some zoos out say Zimbabwe zoo we have never seen this we finish all the training with all the rest of the zoos and then we finish the training we ask um give me the pictures from tourists coming from Zimbabwe zoo and say if based on the pictures we can say well they seem to have zebra giraffe and hippo but then they don't have Panda and Penguin and if they actually agree with the animal in the in the zoo the list then we know we are learning correctly and so basically the the AI can automatically learn some features to tell animals apart from the other without ahead of time individually labeled pictures right so this is kind of denovo learning you don't really need labeled pictures which is pretty nifty and so in our case every tumor is a zoo and in each tumor you have many antigens it's like every Zoo have many many different animals and in each tumor we also computationally extracted many many antibodies and they are like the pictures in that zoo and so we know that uh within each tumor the antibodies are to only recognize the antigens in that tumor um and so if I have only one tumor I can't tell how to match them but if I have so many different tumors and they are all different I can do the same thing the noo infer the antigen antibody pairs without uh knowing you a database of antigen and antibody in a database so the basic idea is that when you see a Target being present in the tumor do we see some antibody sequence features that repeatedly are associated with this Target and they are absent in the tumor that don't have this target right so um the nice thing there is we are not asking the whole antibody sequence to be identical in all the patients because um when antibody sequence could be pretty long the actual binding sequence is called paratope they could be just six or eight amino acid long and there could even be short patches with a gap in the middle the AI can automatically figure this out you know what are the important features that are repeatedly appearing with that Target in the patient tumors and that's kind of the beauty of this it's it's like a you are not asking the whole tiger to look the same instead you're looking at some you know patch on eye on on the skin and on the nose then you know oh this is a tiger right so we are doing kind of the same thing here um and so another interesting thing is when we see an antigen in the tumor and if many many patients repeat repeatedly make antibody against that Target it would tell us that this target is potentially a good cancer drug Target and antibodies that we already saw in the patient tumors are potential good drugs that we can develop into antibody Therapeutics um so an an analogy of this is like this um you can imagine uh in a zoo when a Zoo have a panda oh tourists love to take photos of this because it's really cool they share it on their social media so um panda is very photogenic whereas if the zoo has a a goat oh it's so boring who wants to take photos and you know gener like a and share it on a social media then it's not as good a Target and So based on the pictures we can tell which Target is or the antibodies we can tell which Target is more interesting um so so actually based on the antibody signals we could already tell pdy is a very good Target interestingly many many patients make a little little bit of pd1 antibody already in their tumor it's a better Target than pdl1 and um it's actually much better than T targets like cd47 and Sig like 15 um these two drugs you know were developed in the clinic um and showed a lot of Promise initially but we almost never see patients making antibodies against them and um unfortunately they're not doing well in the clinic right now and so um I can show you the pd1 result so without looking at any any existing pd1 antibodies we just totally use the tumor profiles to help us build a denal pd1 model and with that model basically after we finish AI if you feed the AI Model A sequence that the AI model can tell us whether this is going to be a pd1 antibody or not and so there was a paper published where they um synthesized 10 pd1 antibodies that are already in the clinic and then in visually measured the Affinity of these antibodies against the pd1 Target and so we run those 10 sequences into this denovo derived AI model against pd1 and not only we can predict that they are pd1 antibodies but also um our predicted Affinity surprising to us even uh correlated with the measured pd1 Affinity so the early pd1 antibodies developed by Merk and burst Myer scrip they actually have pretty low Affinity the later antibodies developed by Novartis and also Beijing um they have higher Affinity which is not surprising you know a lot of times and the later companies just they just do this they say okay there is a pd1 antibody from Merc against the pd1 let's develop another antibody that can kind of squeeze out the Puda antibody then it certainly would have a higher affinity and so um we ask can can we use AI to generate another antibody this is by the way it's not really a generative model um we are just pulling out antibod that are already present in the patient tumors and so then we tested them indeed they bind but interestingly um it it binds with very high Affinity but it's a different epitope with Kuda They Don't Really compete with Kuda but we know it can fully block a pd1 PD interaction and so when we tested this in in Mouse tumors so Mouse and human have different pd1 sequence and the functional domain is different so we have to get a mouse that Express a human pd1 to test our antibody and the Kuda antibody um and you can see that um our antibody actually even worked better than the Kuda antibody in terms of tumor control of course we're not developing this antibody because Kuda antibody will be out of patent in two to three years and so this just serve as a proof of concept and so with this we we kind of gain more confidence we ask okay can we get other antibod you know we tried can we get EG antibodies yes patient make egfr can we get her to antibodies Yes actually there is a both load of her two antibodies and patient tumors we also tried other um either um like pretty hot Targets in immune oncology or um oncology like ADC targets and in each of them um we we were able to use AI to pull out antibodies from patient tumors that we then validated indeed bind to the Target of interest and some of them have very very interesting property um so for example you know the B7 H3 Target is actually very conserved between human and mouse and if you were to use this target as a antigen to immunize the Mouse um at the end most of the antibodies generated are only against the region that's different between human mouthe whereas you know when we get this antibody it actually crossreact to both human and mouse which is great and there are also other antib like this one against netive four the initial AI predicted antibody we found can preferentially bind to NE four in acidic environment we hypothesize that in the tumors it's actually already very acidic because of hypoxia so the tumor is actually more acidic and so the antibodies that are generated under the natural environment just bind to the acidic form in a higher Affinity than the neutral form so we feel like because we're deriving this antibody directly from patient tumors they they kind of have all these tumor properties as well um and so here is the way we kind of use the platform for our drug Discovery effort um again we call this platform simultaneous Target evaluation and antibody Discovery because most AI drug Discovery companies they need to um use either published literature or farmer partnership to nominate a Target and the function of the target needs to be fully understood before they can use AI to develop drugs but in our case we kind of don't do it this way we are using 40,000 cancer patients as our ex experimental system and we know that they're all trying right to cure the tumor they just failed but we at least we can see what kind of battle do they fight and if there are some local battles that are repeatedly fought by many many patients maybe that's a good battle and So based on the tumor profile and the AI antibody matching to the Target we can already kind of rank you know which is Panda which is goat in in terms of cancer Target and each of them we can we use AI to predict which are the corresponding antibodies against the target of Interest so that's kind of our initial ranking of which thing are interesting and the second step is really prioritization remember we started the company as a crisper screen company so in the first three years we did like all like many many immune Rel crisper Queens we just knock out each gene in turn in a Cell population and then see which Gene knockout give us the phenotype say tumor growth or uh cell surface protein expression and so on we also collected a lot of public uh crisper screens and we really ask you know which Gene knockout give us an interesting um phenotype um the rest is just more public data mining we look at the normal tissues cancer cell lines mouth tumors and uh human tumor and to look at DNA RNA epigenetics proteomics data some single cell data and also very limited immunotherapy trial samples to help us generate hypothesis is this Gene expressed on cancer cells or immune cells is it associated with some immune signal is it uh influencing patient survival or immunotherapy response right so with these um crisper Queen and public data to help us prioritize we then go to the experimental validation ask um you know if the AI predicted antibody indeed buying to the Target of interest and then invidual or invivo characterize the the antibody and uh that's how we came to the lead program and so in terms of you know other AI especially AI antibody Discovery companies there are many companies recently um some of them um they they don't come up with novel Target also many of them will require a know antibody against a Target already so if you already know this antibody binds to this Target and then you can experimentally generate a lot of slightly different sequences and you can test whether that makes the antibody bind stronger or weaker and with enough data you can build AI models to get a even better antibody for us that's kind of a pretty simple easy question right um there are also two companies they are getting antibodies from patient tumors but they are sequencing the tumors themselves and so from like a dozen patients here and there and they're asking the full antibody to repeatedly appear in two patients or three patients it's much much harder and then once they have an antibody they test it on a protein array with all like 10,000 different antigens to see where this antibody might bind which is pretty cumbersome especially say if you get one herle antibody and it has some issues you you say oh give me another her to antibody it will take the many many experimental testing to get you a second because every time they try a random antibody they hope it's a hurt tool right it's not easy but in our case we start from many many patient samples um and we use AI to already say okay this target is potentially interesting and every time when we make prediction we predict many antibody against that Target at the same time another thing we found is that if this paratope is really repeatedly appearing in so many patients um it seem to be enriched in functional binding you know the say on the PD one there are many many different locations you combine but the function of antibody can really block pd1 pdy interaction if this thing is functional then that antibodies production will stimulate some local cyto kindes allowing this little b cell to expand even more or also repeatedly in different patients and therefore using this approach we seem to be enriching for functional antibodies um another thing is um when you generate like purely generate a antibodies um it's not natural to human therefore when you give it to the patient the patient can actually generate antibody against your drug and then the the the anti your drug antibody will no longer be um active um because the antibody we get are from patient already they are 100% natural like it's fully human therefore we believe that um it will unlikely to be rejected by humans and we also already have a clinic already already a molecule in the clinic compared to other companies who are just providing service to other Pharma so um this kind of ends the platform part of the talk and I will now explain the lead program that we are developing um so this is a uh novel Target that we discovered at a company um called igsf8 and so the the way we discovered this is we were asking oh if pd1 is good and it's better than pdl1 and other targets are there are some similar things like a pd1 there are like a pandas in in the tumors um many many patients make a little bit of this antibody and yet it has very little pattern coverage so for each Target we check how many antibodies have people filed pattern against this Target and this one is like empty nothing available so it was kind of interesting and um igsf stands for immunoglobin super family it's a big family of proteins on the cell surface and all the current immune checkpoint uh molecules are targeting igsf like pd1 pdl1 ctl4 they all belong to igsf family so we ask um are there other molecules like this um because igsf family are known to mediate cell cell interactions and so we saw this Gene you know having pretty good antibody signals then we ask how about crisper screens right we have some in-house crisper screens and there's public crisper screen at the time the broad Institute has just generated crisper screens on hundreds of cancer cell lines and we saw that normally knocking out this Gene does not regulate cell growth cells are fine unless the cancer cell is under immune pressure so we have some in-house data to show that even though it doesn't normally regulate cell growth you know outside the body once you implant this cancer cell into the mouth uh this is a fully immune competent Mouse um then knocking out this Gene will make the tumor grow slower um another experiment is a co-culture experiment we knock out different genes in in cancer cells and co-culture the cancer cell with enk cells natural killer cells again we saw that knocking out this Gene makes the enk cells kill the cancer cell much much better so we saw oh this might be a immune related molecule um and then we look at some public data on this and this is tcga uh blue is normal orange is tumor and so you can see um this Gene is highly expressed in many many solid tumors compared to the normal um on the right in the middle panel here are cancer types where tcj has less than 10 uh normal samples so you can't really calculate a good differential expression so we only look at the tumor it's also pretty highly expressed especially highest expressed in melanoma on the right side there are two cancer types where igsf8 is expressed the lower in the tumor compared to the normal and both of them are kidney cancers so if you work on cancer Immunology or immunotherapy you would know kidney cancers are somehow always different from other solid tumors in fact the pd1 response biomarker is also opposite in kidney cancer compared to the other cancer types which is really strange but this kind of give us also more confidence that this igsf8 might be immune related uh we also look at what other signals are correlated with igsf8 and so we see that when igsf8 is high the tumors overall have lower cd8 T Cell infiltration so it's a immune cold tumor it has lower grenzy and profence so the overall tumor immunity is lower it has lower pdl1 expression meaning that this tumor is unlikely to respond to current pd1 pdr1 antibodies it also have very low b2m expression uh which is kind of low antigen presentation this is actually quite interesting and the last four factors are autophagy factors known to degrade MHC MHC class one at the protein level so um you know in order for for our our immune system or tea cells to recognize the cancer cell as non self the MHC needs to present the mutation onto the surface but if the protein that Express this gets deleted or that get degraded then the the mutations are invisible to your te- cells and so we can see basic in whenever the tumors are not efficiently presenting the antigens that's when the tumors have high IGS of8 um in terms of survival um we we separated every Cancer type patient have have by their MHC class one High versus low expression and in six cancer types we saw that when the MHC class one is low high igsf8 is associated with worse survival so when the patient have high HS of8 they don't do as well um in other immunotherapy trials we saw also kind of interesting phenomenon uh this is a study by team chance group where they treated melanoma patients with pd1 and they are they have both pre-treatment and untreatment data and you can see the the benefit patients which include complete responders partial responders and stable disease patient um when they respond the tumor have lower IGS of8 whereas the nonresponders the the progressive disease patients um their igsf8 levels kind of are are kind of going everywhere we also saw another study by Tony rias's group also melanoma patient treated with anti pd1 even from the pre-treatment sample we could tell if the patient have lower igsf8 they are more likely to be uh having better response to pd1 and better outcome so this also give us some you know evidence of survival benefits um and so we decided to test this antibody predicted from Ai and we got a very good antibody this Gene is highly conserved between human and mouse 90% evolutionary conservation and we are able to uh use AI to get an antibody that can crossreact to um mouse rat monkey and human IGS of8 with similar Affinity so we can use the same antibody for animal experiments as well um so we tested this antibody um against in this case is a mouse cancer cell co-cultured with mouse enk cells and if we add the different doses of this antibody we can see adding this antibody makes the enk cells kill the cancer cells better so in vitro we also see something then we tested the animals inv Vivo this is um um you implants the cancer cell into the mouse to grow a tumor this mouse has full immune system and it's receiving this tumor tumor as if this is a organ transplant and so when the tumor grow out we add this antibody and then um some tumor would kind of actually disappear other tumor will still be there then we can collect the tumor and we do fact sorting on the tumor to look at the immune cells and we saw that with the antibody treatment the tumor has significantly increased the dendritic cells and the natural koler cells and also some increase of CD4 T cells and cd8 T cells and in this tumor um even if we start the treatment after the tumor grow out after four doses some of the tumors would completely go away and even if we stop the treatment and wait for another 30 days the tumors don't really grow back they are still tumor free and this is quite exciting our adviser Gordon Freeman who discovered pd1 pd1 interaction said they were not aware of any other monoclonal antibody against this B16 model that can generate a complete response because B16 has a non antigen presentation defects and so other checkpoint antibodies don't has marginal effect but actually our antibod can curely like totally cure the tumor and so we decided to test more uh models and also try uh compare with anti pd1 and so here I'm only showing you data on melanoma and non small cell lung cancer but we have also tested the cd26 colon cancer emt6 and 41 triple negative press cancer we and we saw very similar result and in each case you can see the blue is control antibody red is anti- pd1 green is anti- igsf8 and purple is if we have the dose of each drug and and combine the two like a combination treatment together and you can see um in each case actually our antibody has monotherapy efficacy in controlling tumor growth and the antibody works the best when we combine them together so we did RNA sequence SE quencing of the tumor and then just uh look at the RNA expression uh signature we always see the antibody increase enk killing increase antigen presentation increase cell adhesion and increase t- cell signaling and so actually when we saw the animal data we didn't have any idea what this drug is doing or what this target was doing the mechanism was kind of figured out over time and this is the current understanding of this target in order for pd1 pdr1 antibodies to work the cancer cell needs to present its mutation through MHC onto the cell surface then t- cell receptor will say well there's a mutation this is nonself it will kill the cancer cell um pd1 pdl1 normal interaction is to make the te cell is kind of a tired or dysfunctional and so when we have an antibody to block this then the te- cell can maintain a very active killing State however a major mechanism of anti pd1 PDR resistance is loss of antigen presentation and this could happen at the DNA mutation level RNA lower expression epigenetic silencing or protein degradation level and every possibility there actually over two3 of the tumors have some kind of antigen presentation defect and so the mutations are no longer visible to the te- cells then te- cells don't have a chance to recognize the mutation infiltrate the tumor or get activated um even in the tumors that initially respond to pd1 when they later develop resistance when people sequence the tumor again 50% of them have mutations on on this this mhd class one so it's a major mechanism of uh immunotherapy resistance however our our body has a mechanism against this natural CER cells are specifically uh supposed to recognize any cell with anti antigen presentation defects and kill them especially if the cell also is under they release some stress signals and if they don't express MHC it's a very good indication the cell is under viral infection and so normally enk cell would just kill them and so then we wonder while in the tumors the cancer cells are under stress they lose MHC class one why don't um enk cells kill them and we found that oh cancer cell is highly expressing this igsf8 um and it was only later we found that it has a natural cooler receptor and a dendritic cell receptor and the antibody that we derived from the patient tumors really block this this interactions both interactions and therefore what happens when we dose the patient or like the mouse tumors at least in this case is um when you use this antibody to block the igsf8 interaction with enk cells enk cells get activated they will kill the cancer cells that lost mhd class one and if the the loss is kind of a soft lot like epigenetic silencing or gene expression lower expression the cancer cell will now have to try a little harder to present their antigen so we will see the cancer cell kind of increase their antigen presentation a little bit in addition the antibody also have a different receptor under dritic cells and this antibody can activate the DC um and so uh dritic cells role is to do antigen presentation both class one and class two and also dendritic cell and enk cells they really help each other active keep each other active and once you have increased antigen presentation both from the cancer cell and the cell then the te- cells get activated and some of the tumors when they don't grow big enough the te- cells when it's activated is enough to cure the tumor but then if the tumor is too big eventually the te- cells will get tired then you add the pd1 antibody they will really help the te- cell maintain the killing as well that's why the two really have Synergy right also for the tumors that initially responds to anti pd1 if we add this antibody to block the uh igsf8 then the cancer cell cannot afford to lose MHT to develop resistance so we also think that the drug will make the pd1 the cancer respond to pd1 a little longer time um so um we we have additional data on genetic evidence of IGS of8 as an IO Target I won't have time to discuss this and so um this antibody because derived from Human um in the CMC development process this is you go to a bioreaction to make a lot of this antibody make it really clean purify it and put it in a bottle that you can give to the patient um we actually had a very smooth manufacturing process and we got excellent yield and excellent developability without any optimization at the um cdmo company which is quite unusual this antibod is like really good um we also did safety uh study in Rat monkeys and the pharmacology uh dyn like um metabolism and safety of the drug in animals also are excellent and so we started the phase one study uh in patients with solid tumors um uh in March of this year and last Friday we had the safety review meeting of the highest planned dose cohort so the drug so far you know it seem seems there's no safety issues um so we we have a lot of um confidence you know going into the next stage of the clinical trial where we'll focus on specific cancer patients and also as soon as they finish what's in the guideline they will be treated with our drug and we're hoping to see some efficacy at that time and so far all the checkpoint Inhibitors are developed against te- cells nothing has been developed in enk cells dendritic cells uh and microage or at least get approved there are there are drugs in the clinical trial there is some difficulty in developing drugs in the innate immunity because many genes on enk cells maccrage or dritic cell are different between human and mouse and so when you develop a drug it's hard to really do this invivo testing um also in human they could also be polymorphic you know the Cure you they're very polymorphic um whereas you know we have this one target it's evolutionarily conserved and yet it can interact with both the enk receptor and theic cell receptor to suppress both cell types we think it really has a lot of potential it could be that in the future all the other immun oncology drugs are going to be combined with either anti pd1 and our drug you know as the combo so we think it could be the next big checkpoint um and so with our technology platform we're not just developing this one drug we're also doing discovery of other Target all having potential to be first in class um unfortunately we don't have enough funding to pursue all of them so we are now in also discussion with pharmaceutical companies to see whether they are interested in giving us money to um do the discovery together and so I hope this can convince you the companies really at the intersection of High super genomics uh you know crisper scens Big Data you know genomics and antibody sequence and cancer Immunology immunotherapy we're actually getting a checkpoint um we're combining the power of genomics and AI to unlock the hidden antibody signals already in the patient tumors to develop therapeutic the first drug is a monocolonal antibody but recently um antibody drug conjugate radio Lian therapy um byp specific antibody or cell therapy they all require a tumor specific Target an antibody to bring this drug to the tumor and so that's area we think we have some special expertise to identify novel targets and antibodies what we envision could be a long-term thing maybe 20 years from now is some cancer patient come in we do their tumor sequencing and based on the analysis we design a antibody cocktail multiple antibodies and we encode them in RNA and then put them in liquid Nano particle like Monna like you inject that into the patient and the patient only cells take up the RNA and produce the antibody cocktail to cure their tumor I think that would be quite exciting so in summary I hope this convinc you that tumor either bulk or single cell RNA seek profiles are rich sources of therapeutic antibodies and we are using AI to really decode a large cohorts of cancer patients tumors uh B cell response to unlock the novel targets and antibodies at the same time you know we got this antibody to even work in animals without understanding a thing about this Gene um and so this is a really novel innate immune checkpoint um in the MHC deficient tumors and this target has receptors on both dendritic cells and enk cells to suppress DC and enk cell function and so we develop this antibody to activate the tumor dendritic cell and enk cells turn the immune Cod tumors hard you know in many animal models we see single agent efficacy and also this drug is synergistic with anti pd1 and we also so far has you know run this safety clinical trial without any safety issues so I want to thank the people in the company um this is definitely a a teamwork um we have a big research site in Shanghai the headquarter is in us um we also have a number of advisors um and also since the trial is in the clinic I want to thank the clinical pi and the patients for giving us the chance um and so I think this is it uh also at the end um I closed my lab last year but fortunately because many former post dos are in faculty positions they are still maintaining the software in the lab um I'm hoping that these tools will still continue to benefit your research thank you very much there oh thanks that was really interesting talk I have a a couple related questions so the first one is when you get the sort of unmappable antibody mrnas is there you know I mean there can be errors in sequencing and I just wonder if like do you have to do you essentially rely on the sequence to be perfect or do you need to sort of do some sort of error correction on your own ah we don't have to do error correction because when even in the same patient um when the B cells are expanded they go through a a somatic hypermutation process to have mutations on antibody to gradually evolve better antibody so even from the same patient you will see different sequences as well they are kind of different from the The Germ line um but then if we are seeing this antibody repeatedly from patient we can kind of know what's the right sequence to use and also after we get the antibody tested we do a little bit optimization as well oh yeah okay so yeah that was the other thing I was wondering so when you have to modify this so that it has this cross species response um do you like what how intensive is it to test different candidates of the cross species antibody ah so H it depends on the target there are some targets that we're only getting the cross human but not Mouse but for igfa we were very lucky the initial molecule already binds to human Mouse with call Affinity then we didn't have to do the Affinity maturation just to do the species cross reactivity no it was very lucky thanks any questions on this side before I give it to attention okay thank you so much for the talk was very interesting um so I was wondering you mentioned that single self sequencing is also employed in conjunction with bulk sequencing so in single cell you able to identify the V cells so do you for example get the reads from single cell sequencing make pseudo bulks and then um assess what antigen are present in the B cells or just all of the sequencing together uh so usually if you sequence a tumor the cancer cells versus immune cells are separate in two separate runs we can get the antigen data as well from the cancer cells but then the uh immune cells we will be able to run this trust algorithm to assemble the antibody sequences they are still I don't think they are really kind of helping to train the model the data for single cell is way too few compared to what we get from bulk so most of the training power comes from the bulk tumors um single cell it's just nice that the heavy chain and light chain are already paired so it's easy for us to synthesize that antibody for testing thank you let me read a question that came in okay chat r r Ryan is asking for Bic data how do you match heavy chain sequences with a corresponding light chain sequence from the same B cell yeah that's a very good question right now if you look at the current AI field for matching heavy chain light chain they have some power in naive B cells in the blood but they have no power once the antibody started a colonal expansion for us um we are getting the bulk tumor so right initially the the heavy chain and light chain are not matched um we do you know for a lot of heavy chain we do kind of think maybe multiple light chains are possible but if this antibody is repeatedly expanded in many patient um you would see the same heavy chain light chain in many patient we do see a significant enrichment of that which can help us narrow down the the choice to test but it's certainly not perfect yet that's why single cell data is very helpful for us yeah so in your AI model uh you don't have you don't use any specific antigen antibody gr truth labels but there's actually a small number of antigen antibod pair that we do know the exact label so do you uh think spiking in those uh antibody um sequence antibody data with uh explicit antigen labels could potentially improve the accuracy of your AI model U we yeah that's a good question it depends on how that antibod is generated because some of these are generated in moue or camel and then they humanized I don't think they will follow the same rule as a human antibody but if it's uh like a from Penning like a fasia Penning but it has to be a synthetic library from well no no not from from natural human be cells for a painting Library maybe you will help but again it's a very small subset compared to the 100 million anbody that we're are getting from tumors um we we can use it to kind of help us validate but we haven't you know I don't think it's going to sway the training as much um surely I have two more questions coming in online um has two let me read her second question first uh you mention mentioned High Affinity yet no safety issues in in face one trials uh is asking for popular pd1 like uh Target such as Kuda and Tiel adverse effects especially Ada always affect a large fraction of patients is it not SE in your case um so right now we have not treated our patient enough time in order for Ada you need a longer time treatment so for our SA 50 it's a 21 cycle and then if it's safe you know at this stage what we care about is patient don't develop cyto storm and die or have very severe side effect and we don't see that uh at least in the first 21 days in order to see whether there's Ada is going to be much longer time but so far if you look at the AI companies or a Pharma trying to develop antibodies without immunogenicity or the likelihood to generate Ada their main goal is to make this antibody look as human as possible which naturally our antibody is human already yeah any other question okay while I'm walking over let me say J has a technical question one of your survival plots and if they are 10 m or fewer how did you get P value of maybe so you mean this one 18 um so each arm for this we have eight mice but we have done many many different models many many different conditions and also CD4 depletion CDA depletion and Casa depletion uh different combos so we are fairly confident about the animal data we we I think overall the different animals we're talking about I'm only showing you a subset we have like probably close to 300 animals for data um have look at the maybe pd1 or in your case like igsf8 antibody resistant chome or something like that and then do you see like the kind of evolution with the antigens that existing in the tumor the tumor cell acquire additional mutations in the anine so that the antibody you design actually also like escaped from the Cuma cells uh so far we haven't seen much specific like point mutation IGS of8 but this Gene is frequently Amplified in the tumors we think that's also a potential evasion mechanism so this Gene normally is expressed in brain and neuronal tissues because our brain you know the they the neuronal cells don't regenerate and so no matter what mutation happens you don't want your immune system to attack this and so neurons don't express mhd class one and that essentially suppress the adaptive immunity and it also highly Express igsf8 and that will suppress innate immunity and we hypothesize the cancer cell just kind of learn it from the brain as well when they lose mhd class why thank you so much uh thank you very nice talk I have a one question so uh you can deduce the uh antibody uh sequence from the public data so how do you find all the all the um antigen in from public data uh the antigen is in the tumor profile as well well oh this is the a protein sequence or uh there are you know RNA sequence and also other like mutations and other immune signals that we are considering in that as well we we also do our additional annotation on the tumor as well okay thank you but it's it's all there all right um maybe I'll take the honor of asking your last question shley could you comment more about the um tu type specificity like which types will stands to benefit in the near future um so you know pv1 has been approved in 18 different uh indications but in each indication only a minority of patients benefit and so now we are doing this trial we are kind of planning for the next stage when we have to settle on a specific cancer type um what we are looking for is um some cancer types right now we cannot use igfa to select a patient because FDA need retrospective study to show that patient with higher igsf8 will benefit more from the drug before we can use it as a biomarker for patient selection what we can do is to ask which cancer types en reach for higher IGS of8 in general like melanoma uh en reach for MHT class one loss which is like lung cancer and colon cancer uh and also which cancer types uh have a met clinical need we we ask the clinics you know do you see patients you know what line of treat treatment can we get so normally for each additional line of treatment uh the patient gets sicker and they have waited even longer time there there's usually a 10% drop in their response to a immunal therapy so we want to go to as early line of treatment as possible so we are asking is this disease very crowded too many other investigational drugs being tested then we don't go to those so it's a kind of complicated decision uh also fairly frequently in the US we can get enough patients that's a kind of holistic consideration good good complicated decision at end note please join me in thanking Dr
