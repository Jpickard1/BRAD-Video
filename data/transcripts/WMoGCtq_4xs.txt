so um we're now going to continue on our theme of cancer and our next speaker is dr scarlet lynn gomez from the university of california san francisco dr gomez received her mph in epidemiology from the university of michigan also and then her phd in epidemiology from stanford university in 2002 she's had an extremely productive research career with over 250 peer-reviewed manuscripts thus far and also has an extremely productive current research portfolio um i counted that she's principal investigator of currently five ro1s all of them being cancer related she's also co-leader of the cancer control program for the helen diller family comprehensive cancer center at ucsf and director of the greater bay area cancer registry she's contributed surveillance data of cancer incidents and outcomes for distinct asian american native hawaiian pacific islander and hispanic ethnic groups as well as cancer patterns by nativity status and neighborhood characteristics today she will be presenting on integrative data approaches for addressing multi-level contributors to cancer health disparities um so dr gomez you can go ahead and share your screen if you're ready all right are you guys able to see that and hear me okay yeah we can hear you great um if you could just go into slideshow mode okay how's that looks great thank you okay so i thank you so much to the organizers for having me here today and um you know every time i listen to dr nguyen talk i just even though here it's seven o'clock in the morning and i've been listening to him since six o'clock in the morning here it's just um as one of the commenters said really mind blown every time just so inspiring um and i hope to be able to follow up on some of the themes that dr winn presented um with regards to sharing um one s one particular research um program that my group is focusing on and using that as an illustr applied illustration of how we're using data integration as an approach to better understand a particular health disparity this here the schematic which is comes from the benton franklin health district really is the driving force and the motivation behind the work that my lab does what this graphic shows is as dr nguyen um so nicely has been talking about a continuum of influences on health outcomes and focusing really particularly on the upstream factors here particularly the social inequities as an institutional inequities as a result of the historical and current institutions that exist within our society these impact upon the living conditions um uh the the our social and the built in physical environments um which subsequently impact upon the behaviors and help out the upstream and downstream directionality of this graphic is particularly important and i want to really highlight this because the as we know the vast vast majority of research biomedical research focuses on these downstream factors but as you see from the background pictorial here and again as dr one illustrated we can't begin to fully un impact upon these downstream factors until we also start to address these upstream factors because the influences flow from the upstream to the downstream and um this is kind of the beauty of of doing these presentations from home as dr wynne was answering the question about polit actionable uh small area level analyses i wanted to share quickly one example in which we've been able to use our data this is now wearing my hat as the director of our regional cancer registry to be able to generate and put out their um information to stakeholders in the general public and decision makers data that are are meaningful and actionable so this is actually um this is a little bit of a flora an aside from the main topic of my presentation um this is our mapping portal that our registry produced in collaboration with nci and weststacks called californiahealthmaps.org following this project nci has actually taken this back this this format and partnered with additional state cancer cereal cancer registries to generate a similar kind of mapping portal one particular aspect i wanted to illustrate is that we have been hearing for again because of our own operating a cancer registry we've been hearing from stakeholders particularly community members that the traditional way in which we examine the traditional geography by which we examine cancer incidents which is at the county level is the smallest aerial level is really not meaningful for being able to influence upon um actionable reductions and policies for reducing cancer this was the primary motivation in our partnership with nci and westat was to see if we could if it's feasible to report cancer incidence rates at a sub-county level so this is what these zones are zones are aggregations of census tracts based on attribute similarity for california we have 58 counties and we were able to through this project develop 580 zones and so you could see here the the the geography of some of the zones and some of our really urban areas like the bay area and la there are very very um the zones are much smaller in geography than the counties but what i wanted to particularly point out here is that in addition to the zones we provide with this pull down menu several additional area types that um users of this website are able to use to pull up to query cancer incidence rates and this was um also following on feedback we heard from stakeholders that yes sub-county area levels are great um mssas which is a particular geographic unit also sub-county within california that's great census doesn't need a place that's great but what we really want to would be really actionable would be able to is to be able to produce data that our congress people our legislators can really use um and so we have also within this mapping tool provided the ability to query cancer incidence rights by additional political districts voting districts um so i will move on thinking about that schematic the upstream downstream schematic and talk a bit about now a project that we're using in which we're applying that concept to a multi-level approach for addressing cancer health disparities this is probably hopefully well known to many of you this is the salsa society model um that came about from the centers for population health and health disparities a program of multiple projects within the um i was funded by the nih um this graphic is adapted from a publication in american journal public health in 2008 from de gornike and what it illustrates is the interaction of factors from cells biological factors to society upstream to fundamental causes and the idea that we must begin to study the interactions among these factors in order to better understand underlying causes to cancer health disparities so i'm going to talk about how we've applied that framework and this model to looking at lung cancer and never smoking asian american native hawaiian and pacific islander females this is um perhaps a disparity that's less well-known but in fact as as you'll see from some of the data that i i'm going to present um definitely a persistent and striking disparity um why lung cancer among asian american females as you could see here these are mortality rates and the proportion these are the rank based on the age-adjusted mortality rate in the percent of all cancer deaths for um for different asian american ethnic groups on the top panel are the data for males and the bottom panel or the data for females you can see here or that i've highlighted among females for all of these six largest asian american ethnic groups that lung cancer ranks in the top um one two or third most common contributor largest contributor to lung to cancer overall cancer mortality of all cancer sites why is this striking this is striking because among asian american females very low percentages of them in fact smoke or active smokers when we look at data from the behavioral risk factor survey or the national health interview survey for example generally fewer than five percent of asian american females are smokers yet we see here that lung cancer is a major contributor to cancer mortality in these populations we also know that asian at this population that we call asian american native hawaiian pacific islander or sometimes we we see them referred to as api asian pacific islander is an incredibly diverse population they represent people from 30 different countries speaking more than 100 different languages and we also know from our descriptive cancer surveillance data that lung cancer incidence varies widely across these groups what's particularly notable is that in select case series we have noted that more than 50 percent of lung cancer cases in asian american native hawaiian pacific islander females are among never smokers this is incredibly high and when we contrast this to the number of 15 percent of lung cancer long liver smokers are among nervous smokers when we look among all u.s females yet until now until our work here that i'm going to be sharing with you we've had no sufficiently large data source to be able to document what the actual incidence rates are by detail race ethnicity and smoking status and this is because smoking information and cancer registry data have only recently begun to be collected and we see lots of missing data so it's really currently not usable information as of yet and of course because we also have no population estimates by smoking status to be able to estimate incidence rates um this is uh that was the motivation for our project we put together a team comprising of multiple my colleagues at ucsf um stanford sutter health northern california kaiser permanente hawaii and foreign partnership with two state cancer registries this this was funded by an r01 um with myself and my colleague dr iama chain is a pitas dpis the objective of this study was to firstly assemble a multi-level integrated data set then to conduct incidence analyses by smoking status and by groups defined by detailed race and ethnicity apologize for my dogs and then focusing in particular on asian american native hawaiian pacific islander females to compare the distributions of social demographic and tumor characteristics and to conduct risk analyses we published in cebp last year the approach to this integrative data analysis and briefly the our methods were to compile the code words a longitudinal cohorts covert comprises all individuals including all sexes and all race ethnicities who had had an in-person visit at two healthcare systems sutter health northern california or kaiser permanente kaiser permanente in hawaii um as recorded in their ehrs we chose these two particular health care systems for their high representation of indian american native hawaiian pacific islander groups um southern northern california is covers a third of the northern california population kaiser hawaii obviously is a much smaller health care system but is very robust due to it being in hawaii robust with regards to its representation of asian american native hawaiian pacific islanders we also were interested in partnering with healthcare systems that had data um that could check two boxes with regards to the data that they had in their ehrs one is that they have complete uh and detailed information on race ethnicity and at the time that we did this study that one box um cannot be checked by a lot by the vast majority of the healthcare systems that we approached to partner with the second criteria the second box that we that the healthcare systems have to be able to check was to have complete information on smoking status and again this is something that even today is not being consistently and completely reported across all health care systems um the members must be the inclusion criteria are that the covert members must be 18 years of age at the baseline visit have a california or hawaii address at the time of the baseline visits this facilitates follow-up for lung cancer diagnosis by linking to the relevant statewide cancer registries to enable collection of smoking status individuals must have had collection of social history at some point during the study period to be able to be included in the cohorts the exclusion criteria with that was that they had if they had a history or prior lung cancer diagnosis either recorded within their medical record or registry case record um this resulted in a covert that included over 2.2 million individuals 1.87 from sutter health and 340 000 from kaiser hawaii um the overall cohort included 1.275 million females and a little over 1 million males and for all cohort members we extract extracted data from the ehrs on sex race ethnicity smoking status and preferred language and whether translator was requested and just a little bit of further detail on how we looked at smoking status this was actually probably a several month long process because this was a key variable of interest in our analysis smoking status was specified by using we developed a simple algorithm that used smoking status values from two different time points the first smoking status collected after the baseline visits in the last smoking status collected for um during uh the course of our study and dates or the date of their lung cancer diagnosis we ended up classifying smoking status as ever comprising former nervous smokers and never smokers comprising those with values only for never or her passive smoking then among asian american females who've never smoked and this was a little under 200 000 covert members we extracted additional data elements um specifically known and putative risk factors from their ehrs we then conducted a linkage to two statewide us cancer registries california and hawaii um linking based on names states of birth and social security numbers um at the time we did this analysis we were able to link through follow-up data through 2013 and then from the cancer registry data we included lung cancer cases that were microscopically confirmed and were carcinomas we ended up identifying over 7000 lung cancer cases and we extracted from the cancer registry select information including dates of diagnosis tumor stage and histology we then also geocoded um all of the data from the from the cohorts um over two million uh address individuals were able to have their addresses geocoded and we did geocoded to a block group level so that gave us the most flexibility in terms of being able to integrate in geospatial data for this study we were specifically interested in neighborhood factors including neighborhood socioeconomic status ethnic composition and traffic density as well as regional air pollution and this here we were able to ascertain this only for the northern california sutter sites so specifically we looked at a measure of particulate matter 2.5 pm 2.5 there's a very detailed schematic here which don't worry i'm not going to be walking through in detail but the idea really is to show you how much granular information we were able to glean from these two healthcare systems and the degree of um critical thinking that our group collectively went through to think about how to how to code race ethnicity um within this study our approach at a very high level was to prioritize coding of asian american native hawaiian pacific islander groups oh i should mention that in both healthcare systems um the patients were allowed to identify with multiple race ethnicities so we really took a lot of time this was probably just a six-month process alone among our large group just to decide um how to code race ethnicity including how do we code in multiple race groups we also were really interested in prioritizing smaller populations as well as being able to distinguish between single and multiple races and ethnicities um this graphic shows the representation of the asian american native hawaiian pacific islander populations within our cohorts the integrated approach and selection of the two particular healthcare systems with high representation of these populations as you can see allows for us to be able to study these groups to have sufficient numbers of these ethnic groups um to allow for subgroup analyses um and so as you can see while 5.5 or 5.6 of the overall u.s population is asian american nearly 16 of our cohorts is asian american and while 0.1 percent of the u.s population is native hawaiian 2 percent of our cohort is native hawaiian okay so results um these are this graphic shows the distribution of smoking status among female lung cancer cases from our cohorts so they're to read that a little a little under 4 000 cases by detailed asian american native hawaiian pacific islander race ethnicity so let's start first with looking at the proportion of never smokers or lcims so that's represented here by the teal on part of the stacked bar graph in this cohort we see that among the females diagnosed with lung cancer 21 of the non-hispanic whites were never smokers 14 among black were african-american women and 38 among hispanics for native hawaiian pacific islanders 15 were never smokers and for asian americans combined 50 were never smokers but we also know tremendous heterogeneity in number smoker status across the aa and hpi groups ranging from 14 to 10 20 among native hawaiians and other pacific islanders to 79 among chinese females i just want to pause here um the first time we ever saw these results um the first time that these results have ever really been eliminated among these asian american ethnic group populations are are in these results here the striking number among chinese american females so this is to say among females with lung cancer these are people diagnosed with lung cancer 80 of chinese have never smoked um this was recently published uh just last late last fall in the journal jmci um so we also looked at incident rates of lung cancer because we designed this ehr integrated cohort as a longitudinal study we were able to calculate incidence rates and what you can see here is that compared to the incidence rate among non-hispanic white female number smokers the age adjusted in symmetry was 10.1 nearly all asian american native hawaiian pacific islander groups had incident rates that were one and a half to two times higher compared to the non-hispanic white group the striking exception was among japanese-american women although you could see that the confidence intervals even with our large large data set confidence intervals were still somewhat wide um and so this observation among japanese american women we actually see for a several other cancer sites where their patterns tend to look more similar to that among non-hispanic whites we have we see this for breast cancer as well for example and this likely is due to in part to the fact that japanese americans as a group um they're one of the first groups that haven't immigrated here to the u.s and we do tend to see higher proportions of later generations of japanese americans in the us uh we are wrapping up our analysis on this r01 um by looking for by our book this is the aim two that focuses specifically on asian american native hawaiian pacific islander female member smokers um using data from the ehr on smoking previous lung diseases infectious diseases and reproductive body size were analyzing their associations on and calculating attributable risks associated with lung cancer risk and the through the geocoding and linking in the geospatial data is focusing in particular on air pollution and neighborhood social environments looking at their associations as well and my colleague mindy darylan has an administrative supplement in which she's merging in additional neighborhood social built and physical environmental datas um in the data data elements and applying a random forest machine learning approach to an exposomic approach to analyze identify additional neighborhood factors associated with one cancer risk um we've been able to apply this model this approach to a second study looking at liver cancer disparities um this study is looking at disparities in hcc hepatocellular carcinoma incidence it as well as surveillance of high-risk individuals in addition to the two health care systems that we that we included in the lung cancer study we in this study are um uh have been able to add an additional health care system the san francisco health network which comprises public hospitals and safety net hospitals within the county and city of san francisco in this study we're looking at neighborhood level factors including neighborhood scs ethnic enclaves as well as patient and provider level factors derived from the ehrs so some lessons learned there are many many lessons learned from this experience here are just sort of some running thoughts that our group have put together some considerations when using this data integration approach the approach obviously is highly efficient we saw the numbers that we were able to get compared to the noble development of an active cancer cohorts however we also learned that data integration is very very time consuming and requires a lot of efforts in ways that may not be obvious certainly to us in the planning phase the approach especially if you're using data across multiple institutions involves extensive extensive and cannot underscore this enough extensive data sharing and data use agreements baas etc including mutually agreed upon data transfer protocols in addition it's vital to specify data extraction with knowledge of data structures at each site and to spend the time needed on procedures that will harmonize the data across the sites creating merged variable categories while trying to preserve as much granularity as possible we took a lot of work um to a care to describe the representativeness of our cohort right recognizing that these healthcare systems although they do represent a fairly substantial chunk of the underlying population i'm certainly not population-based so we recognize that this effort was needed to aid the interpretation of the generalizability of our results further extensive and informed data cleaning and attention to missingness and bias is a must so we really spent a lot of time probably a good year just doing different sensitivity analyses to understand we know that these data were not collected for the purposes for which we're using them for so we really wanted to understand and make roll out any sources of bias in our results we know that communication and documentation were key the project had data stewards at each of the healthcare systems we used detailed variable dictionaries and provided data sites with coding dictionaries even with that effort though data cleaning and preparation typically warranted correcting coding dictionaries and repeated data extraction so that's something now going in that we we definitely need to factor in and with that i want to thank you for your time and hopefully we have time for a few questions if there are any thank you so much dr gomez and um let's see we're a bit behind but if anyone has a question um please feel free to unmute yourself and ask it dr gomez uh thank you for your presentation one of the things that's really interesting to me is when you say the chinese woman has a higher sort of lung cancer rate though they are actually less likely to be a smoker uh what what is your hypothesis on explaining this have you considered this uh sort of a second three hund smoking oh yeah thank you for that question um we unfortunately did not have good secondhand smoke data within the ehr data to be able to look at that factor specifically unfortunately the way that health care systems code smoking status is really one one variable that has a code for secondhand smoke so it's not coated mutually exclusively and the proportion that had a secondhand smoke exposure coated within our cohorts was just really negligibly small so we estimate there might be some under ascertainment of secondhand smoke within these populations we are actually doing i forgot to mention that we following on the results from what i just presented we um receive funding to do um actually a population-based case control study in which we're collecting denoble data to be able to identify what some of these risk factors are so exactly answering the question that you're asking we don't know exactly what's contributing to the high burden of lung cancer among asian american female nervous smokers because there's never been a study done here in the us actually the case control study that we're doing is the first effort to really start to disentangle this however there have been many studies done in asia and those studies have identified risk factors including exposure to secondhand smoke air pollution and factors like exposure to cooking oil fumes using coal as a heating element indoors especially in the presence of poor ventilation and previous lung diseases but we also note that the prevalence of these particular exposures are much much higher in asia than they are here in the u.s so we don't know the extent to which these particular factors may be relevant here in the u.s um and i want to note that in our case control study we're really focusing on some of these exposures as a social justice issue as a health equity issue to the extent that we know there are particular occupations and occupational exposures that may be um more common among asian american populations here in the u.s as well as neighborhood level exposures yeah thank you so much and one other thing i'm just curious about do you have data on the immigration status data like the people who have early exposures versus later on the air pollution site right yeah that's another great question um it's the health care systems did not collect that information but that was why we extracted information on language and translator use which is really collective for clinical care purposes but that was really the extent to which we were sort of sort of able to get at that factor but we're certainly collecting very detailed immigration history and residential history data in our current case control study and of course you know i think it's important to know for any one of us who are doing small area level analysis is the residential history and especially here the outcome we're looking at lung cancer incidents one cancer risk potentially has a very long latency period and the way that we're looking at neighborhood level and physical environmental exposures is you know just that one snapshot in time so there's a lot of assumptions that go into that exposure the way that we're measuring it [Music] thank you okay thank you very much and thank you dr gomez for being willing to join us uh so early in the morning in your time so at this point we have a break planned um i think we'll shorten that's to just five minutes and we'll start back at 10 40. um if people online want to continue you know ask a couple more questions that's fine i want to give a break to everyone in person at least right there wherever you are i'm muted
