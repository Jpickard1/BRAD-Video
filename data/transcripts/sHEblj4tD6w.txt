okay get started my pleasure to introduce professor Aaron paradise - Frank comes to us from postdoctoral studies a prestigious presidential post doctoral fellow and both Michigan where he worked on developing a framework of actual non-coding RNA molecules are carried out undergraduate studies at University of new New York entering in chemistry completely from UC Irvine and worked at the research fellow for two years prior to a scholar at member jamierand what pharmaceutical company directed towards RNA target for the Frank's research throws an important market but cellular controi function which will employ both technique and computational biophysics combining key approaches with characterized in the structure and motion of technical molecules welcome thank you okay so first of all thank you for taking the time out to come listen to me talk about some of the work that we're doing in my group and so today I want to talk about is to ensure at the point of the moment of our solutions do the different solutions the challenges that we face in biophysics so to start off out this first do something like Tiffany forget to do which is acknowledge the people who do a lot of the work or who I collaborate but I should say so you have my group members here are so relevant with it I'm going to talk about as Ben Qaeda by question who is a graduating she's a graduate student will be leaving the group soon if I have time I'll talk about some of the work that indeed has done as well to dizzily this is the group the graduate students and also some of our collaborators my collaborators are the ones that motivate a lot of things that we do right so I'll try to bring that to the fore as I go through this presentation so a pretty intimate group so if you have questions about something that I said there wasn't Claire feel free to stop me and ask questions along the way okay so a good starting point for the research that we do is the central dogma of molecular biology you've probably seen as many times but I'll quickly go through this right so the idea is that you know all the information needed to sustain life is stored enough you know in own DNA that DNA is transcribed to form RNA which is then translated to produce proteins today the focus in terms of biophysics and in general has been on focusing on cookies right but a question is a what fraction of all the RNA transcripts that are translated actually or transid into cookies and the answer it's a very small fraction if you actually look at the numbers right manaphy percent of the genome encodes for some RNA transcript yet only approximately 2 percent of the genome codes for proteins so when I took about biochemistry and undergrad yeah there was that all the 98% of the the information stored in the teens it's just right but now we know that's not the case right and it turns out that allowed the RMA that do not necessarily code for proteins actually have functional relevance so it brings this point which is a drug discovery heads in focus Museum on proteins but what about RNA right if indeed RNA is able to regulate the processes biological processes it might actually want to also focus on RNA as a search party so there's a lot of excitement right now but of targeting RNA and treating them with a drug target and some of that motivates tor the research that we do ten-minute so if I had to break down the research in my group it's a focus and three to four main areas right so we do a lot of work centered around structure prediction that that is predicting the structure of of an RNA so typically what we find ourselves in the situation where we can use a variety of computational tools to generate a lot of structures for a given RNA the problem becomes the selection problem how do you select from all of these are their first set of structures the one that we would use as our prediction right and so we've actually employed a technique where we use chemical shifts that you can get access to from NMR experiments to be able to help us do this selection don't we have structure RNA target the next thing we're interested in is try to find small molecules that might be able to bind to that structure and stabilize a particular conformation and so here what we're trying to do is define all molecules that fit neatly into some binding pocket and so here you're seeing an example or we've got a series of small markers into this RNA and yeah it is that based on the docking score we get which is a to give us some sense of whether or not this small molecule can favority interact with the RNA then we could probably a prior to characterize those molecules and test them experimentally some today we started to do a lot of knowledge molecular design and so right now we're developing techniques where we can design small molecules that bind to a particular RNA at a particular location or by molecule in general and the way we do that is by leveraging generative models right so I know most of you are probably well aware of the excitement around generative models and so there are lots of interest in using generative models to design small molecules now what we're doing is actually interfacing these generative models with molecular dockings simulations so that we can actually sample structures from these they can space described by these designers dock them figure that they buy neatly if they they do send them back to the space change tomography is slightly and do this in a curative process and a lot of sort of design novel Maltese there are challenges you'll pay attention you realized only challenges in this field is the fact that some of the molecules you design are not chemically feasible right so you see some of these lost more people quite strange right today lot of work being done around generating or building generative models that can output realistic molecules but that's not a focus of what we're doing where our work is mostly taking these this these generative models and then using them you know in a design process the last area that we're interested in is El or to call activate simulation methods and these methods allow us to simulate very complex processes so this was supposed to be a movie but it's not working but essentially what we're interested in is processes like the unwinding of the ligand from a project or the dissociation of a complex to use a conventional molecular dynamics relations these processes take a very long time to observe so only things we're doing is coming up with clever ways to accelerate these processes so that we can observe them in a given amount of simulation time well do today is very talk mostly about structure prediction work and if we have some time out or we talk about tomorrow or accelerated our summation methods terrific facial biophysics or biophysical chemistry group and so the work we do tenten's around or are the interface of physics biology and chemistry now there's an additional domain and that domain is the domain of data science right and so we set it right at this interface where we try to leverage developments and data science the help of answer questions that lie on this interface here the first thing I'll talk about is tools to predict RNA secondary structure and also 3d structure or the tertiary structure and all that is motivated by this problem right so for a given RNA you may know the sequence and so you want to feel what the structure of that RNA is and so it is to be broken up into two separate processes the first is predicting what the secondary structure is because you will see this a number of times in the top I just want to orient you so this is the sequence and this is the the five prime end in the three prime end and every where you see a your line connecting to two nucleotides corresponds to the base pair right so in this case this G's is a threat to the seat there and this youth basic spear to this a here don't you have the secondary structure you can build models that are consistent with the secondary structure thank you so the workbook for going from sequence instructor will be the first predict the secondary structure once you have secondary structure use that to generate models at a fixed distance and so there lots of tools that already exist to the carrier of this process and so we're going to focus mostly on this just the first step which is to predict secondary structure from sequence but where we go to do this is using an integrative approach where we leverage information from NMR spectroscopy right and and the reason we want to do this is kind of illustrated here so imagine we have this RNA this is the sequence and it turns out that RNA can RNA molecules can adopt multiple confirmations and so it's not a one-to-one problem so it's a single sequence could map to the many the stable are the company and so here is a hypothetical example where this are the sequence and folded to these key structures and so on you have what we will call the ground state that's the state that has the highest probability of being observed and it is this transient state here so conventional methods for determining this structure if you applied it to this hypothetical scenario right would only be able to access or would have only get signal from this dominant state essentially what it means is that its transient state would kind of remain invisible to these techniques and that's because the fact it's so lowly populated something right so there's a problem here but that's fine also the the point now is that there are these techniques NMR techniques that actually allow you to detect the chemical shifts signature for this transient state right and it and what that in principle allows us to do if methods that we have the right methods they probably take this chemical shift information for the transients they actually try to model the structure right so what we're going to try to answer here is can we used with chemical shift to conditionally predict the secondary structure of an RNA and say condition conditionally because we're conditioning the prediction that we want to attempt the condition of prediction of structure based on chemical shifts but we have chemical shifts for these two states we want to actually be able to make two distinct predictions about the secondary structure and that is going to be driven by the chemical shift so we're fortunate using a machine learning approach and so what we did is to collect data when you are structures so we know what the structures of the RNA is or the armies are and we have chemical shift data so we do some data of some quality control cells to then produce a set of high quality NMR structures and chemical shifts where we try to mitigate any error that is in the data once we have this structure chemical shift database we train these machine learning models that attempt to predict the base pairing status of every residue in the RNA based on the chemical shift right now when I say base prank status I'm just saying for a given residue we ask the question is this residue base paired or not we're not asking if this what this residue is based richer I said that's the another question I will get to that in a bit so this would be the workflow you get the data then training these models and this model will then you use the predicted based grading status and then we have some model assessment steps so the technique we use to actually train our or the kind of classifiers we use where these machine your own network classifies this audience I think I don't think I have to spend a lot of time describing how your networks work but the rest you know we feed in in the input layer chemical shifts and again these are this is the chemical shift for all the atoms in a given residue that have an Amara assigned to them right and I would feed us into this network and at the end it predicts whether or not that residues a spared the chemicals just for residue goes in the output is a probability that that residue stays greater so they'll approach we are regenerated six independent what we call cs2 BPS classifiers meaning chemical shift the base pair status classifiers and we train this on a hundred and eight RNA structures or which we also had the chemical shift data and so pair is some of the results so reported fear we're showing that true positively that the probability that if we predict a residue a residue to be base pair that is is in fact a spirit and you can see our mean true positive rate is about point nine five which is acceptable and the true negative rate is about point seven two right so you can see those there's the clear difference between the true positive rate into negative rate and the reason for the Miller true negative rate we believe is that we have less examples of residues that are not base paired in our dataset right so there is an imbalance in our dataset and I think it's reflected in you know in the lower performance arm in terms of predicting whether our residue is not based bit question question for hydrogen for every residue right you have multiple writes that are we have temperatures and multiple sites in that recipe so there it is possible to do site-specific labeling right but if you decides to delay only you might essentially get be able to assign the chemical shifts for a given residue so you're able to get access to the set of chemical shifts for those carbons or yeah which is then converted into you know this this measure that gives you a sense of the electronic environment around the in this particular site is not just how fast right so I think there is some in the chemical shift itself you may not have that measure of its relaxation process you're talking about right but if you can you can definitely acquire that information from NMR [Music] yes so it's a good question so the baby acts discussion is that that's not really that's not we're interested in because the challenge here is to take a single sequence and make multiple prediction you feed your sequence into M tool for example you didn't get one answer right and that's the global rillette yes so the difference of accuracy is probably we're better by about point do or you're - right so it's not significant right but that's the point I'm trying to make it we're not concerned with that because what we're after is an ability to condition our prediction on the chemical shift data right so in cases where you have an RNA that can adopt multiple states and I said one of the states the - state right we want to actually be able to change the chemical shifts associated with - State and make a prediction about what it looks like you can't do that using these techniques where you just simply take a sequence and it gives you one prediction as to what the second structure is makes sense that's less effective okay so here I won't be predicting if a spray status but what we're after is really secondary structure right so we're missing that connectivity information right so base pairing status tells us nothing about Bey spirit connectivity well we have to come up with an approach that allows us to now turn this information about the base pairing status of individual residues into an activity incoming it's all we do you know imagine you have the chemical shifts and the sequence of some RNA you don't know what the structure is you would feed it into a classifier for every residue would give you the base drink thatís right and we call this TRS and then what we do is leverage the infrastructure that has already been used to incorporate these kinds of probabilities that would derive some chemical mapping data into secondary structure prediction right so we just feed it all from and then we add this restraint term that allows us to ensure that the structures we generate or in agreement with our predictions and then we're able to produce a final model right and the cool thing about this is is that we can actually use utilize these predictions with any most critics shouldn't mess with falling programs because they love them have been have features that allow you to take chemical mapping information which is just essentially a measure gives you a measure of the probability that the residue stays good right so at this stage from this point on there's really no difference between our approach and a chemical mapping information the difference comes with how we arrive at these probabilities so the question is okay how did how do we perform right so what we did is for all of the our days and our in our training in our dataset which is 108 we folded the structures using our what we called cs4 for chemical shift fold okay what you're seeing you were reporting the true positive rate and it's positive predictive value and they were focused on base pairs now actual base pairs right so this repository gives a measure of whether the probability that a base pair that is that that is known to be a thread that we the probability that a resin base where we predict to be base red is actually basically in the correct structure and then the positive predictive rate has to do with whether or not all of the base pairs we predicted turns out to be actually true base pairs so these numbers what you want em to be as close as possible to one they could see here we have a mean value of 0.9 6 and here we have one of those 195 so we're happy with this result but again this is not this is just a this is not what we're after necessarily they just simply have I to carbon written and and hi I positive rates and I put of the predicted values but really after is being able to conditionally predict the second extractor and so well sure you know is an example of a RNA which adopts this are they adopt two different states right on the two different sets of conditions so this is the Florida ever switch not going to talk much about what the Florida I will switch does but this is the secondary structure of the forever bus which when it's in this magnesium free state and then this is when it's in the equal state and this is when you add magnesium but not the fluoride but the fluoride ligand that it finds right so you can see a dramatic change in structure they received the formation of these two Dornoch base pairs that are absent in this state here so we have chemical shifts for both states right and so what we did is actually try to predict the secondary structure and so the way to read these images is that if you see green lines that corresponds the cases where the base pair is present in both of predicted structure and the actual structure these recent green line in green green connections here correspond to bases we got correct these dotted red line corresponds to base pairs that are extraneous to all predictions so meaning that it's present only enough in our predicted structure absent in actual structure they could see one of them showing up in this in this structure and so with that you can see that we're actually able to conditionally predict the structure of this flora gravel switch and the only difference is the chemical shift that we use to get the base pairing probabilities which we then use the guides the folding algorithm and so in this case that you're positive areas devote more is one and then the positive predictive value is 0.98 this is the magnesium free state and then for the April state the true positive rate is about point nine three and the same value for the positive value so this is really cool ah this is further we were even more excited about this results because of the fact that here we only used data for the DS the guanine right furthermore we only use data for a subset of the repairs the autumn so forth H 1 prime D 1 prime H on Prime and C D 888 right but even with I said sparse restraints essentially were able to conditionally predict the structure any questions so is their typical into a silent critic and so you're asking what about directly predicting the base pair rather than going through this process um I could imagine one could come up with an approach to do this right but for us we were inspired by existing frameworks for utilizing chemical math and data right and so they do the chemical mapping experiments they give you this probabilities and you feed them into the folding algorithms right where we did or what we did here is say okay what about getting those probabilities from random are chemical shifts so we just kind of plugged into an existing framework to be able to predict the secondary structure but one could definitely for example build models where you give it the sequence and train them to predict base pairing directly but that's not something we did here now we have a project where we actually go in the opposite direction where we're doing are in a design where we can we try to predict the sequence that maps onto a given target structure so imagine here if you removed all the identities of every residue here and you asked given this structure can I predict what sequences would map on it we're doing that kind of work and being a pusher doing we were utilizing for that work and actually be used as well for the conventional structure prediction approach which would be what you're talking about going from sequence directly to structure but that's not something that we try to as yet any other questions the thing is that you know we can use TS full definition we predict the secondary structure of the Florida ostrich and this is very careful right we've only tested it with festival to rnase and we've gotten decent result in two rnase but you know you still need to take the test extensively to to ensure that it's something that general and this statement is general so another thing we can do arm there's another approach we can take to actually try to model the secondary structure of RNA right RNA and so we imagine you can take sequence and generate several secondary structure models so here what you're showing our different second restriction models we also included the information that allows you to figure out how accurate the model is so if where you see the green lines again these correspond to base pairs that are present in the actual structure and this little model the red lines are extraneous to the model the black ones are base pairs that are missing from the model that should be there right so you can see you have this model here is the one that will be correct right it's a second nature to model that will be correct and then the others have some errors in them this one here the terminal base pair is missing for example so imagine you have some tool that allows you to sample these right one way you could incorporate chemical shift into this analysis is very building tools to predict chemical shifts directly from these models right so we've actually developed a machine learning model using random forests that allows us to for every residue predict the chemical shifts based on the structural information that you can derive from this this model here and so what you could do then is then take that chemical shifts you predict for a residue and compare them to the actual chemical shift that you have and so one way to incorporate this is using a probabilistic approach where what you do is to essentially assign weights to every structure such that the ensemble average chemical shift matches the chemicals measured chemical shifts and so these weights are you sent to the optimally assigned so that you maximize the agreement and if you use a Bayesian framework to do that to do this so you can see if you apply this to this I would have to go case right you have these one two or three little models that have some appreciable probability attached to them and then you have these that have zero probabilities right what you can do is then construct an ensemble that is based on these sets of structures and you have weights assigned to them and so they take away here is that you we can use the chemical shifts to generate a kind of probabilistic model of the RNA structure rather than having a singer' structure we can actually have a set of structure for every structure we assign a weight and weight here is optimally assigned by comparing the measured and predicted chemical shifts now something I'm glossing over is the fact that to be able to do this you must be able to predict the chemical shifts from these low resolution models and so we've actually go to as well we haven't attempted to do that as well but one thing that I had there was a slide that I took up here is what we what one could imagine doing is actually building a consensus secondary structure model based on all of these where you could essentially for every face where that shows up you can add the probabilities across these and then at the end generate a similar model that composed of only the most probable base pairs right just kind of related to what you're talking about but it's not it's not exactly the same but yeah that's something that's we were actually in the process of doing and I actually took on the slide that kind of highlighted how want to do that as well any questions at the state so one could imagine do this doing this at a 3d level right so you you could have you have this this scenario here where what I'm showing you is a fragment of an RNA that the correct structure is shown in white and the different models are shown in green right and below we show the structural agreement between them right if we give the rmsd so these two models are the closest to the actual structure so and then then you have these models that have Heights that are far away from that lid and solve structure and so this is the kind of result that you typically encounter when you try to use modeling tools well you use additional tools to generate models for in RNA actually you have to select among these and so again what you could do is compute chemical shifts from their structures and compare them to experiments and attach weights to each one of the structures and if you do this in this case you can see that you can actually isolate the two models that actually have the best structure of agreement with a null and iron with the known structure which is an NMR structure and so it suggests that we might also be able to use this kind of probabilistic approach to model the 3d structure of RNA right so let's shift gears just a little bit and we're going to talk about RNA structure prediction but focused on finding ligand complexes right so this is motivated by our interest in doing virtual screening where we have a tartlet structure of the RNA and we want to find small molecules that took meeting their binding pocket and so the setting of the wave would simply use you would back let's say a million compounds into the binding pocket for each one of them you have to predict the poles and based on the predicted poles you estimate the binding affinity and then you rank made in compounds based on the binding affinity and choose the ones that are predicted to be most favorable right then that work flow post prediction is really important because if you post prediction is inaccurate then your estimation of the binding affinity would also be connected as well right do we have an interest in trying to improve the success rate of these post predictive methods so this is the typical setup you have an RNA and you can generate the number of pulses and so the person is just a unique conformation and orientation of the ligand relative to the receptor in this case all right RNA if you have some pulses here you have some folders here you also have poses in the native binding pocket and you have the native structure here so this is another selection problem right we could generate lots of possible solutions but the challenge is collecting which ones right actually this negative structure there so the state-of-the-art methods actually exhibit the LES around 50% success rate meaning that if you knew if you give it a hundred struct 100 fine accomplishes where you knew what the structure of the conference was and 50% of the cases you'll get it right and 50% of the cases you get it wrong right and so we want to be able to actually develop tools to better distinguish these non-native or a correct hoses from the near native poses so to begin this work we had to design a way it's what we call an interaction fingerprint or what's what is an interaction for different that describes the interaction between our target receptor the RNA and the small molecule and this kind of highlighted here you have the RNA and then you have the small the small molecule and so for every autumn in a small molecule in the blue sphere we calculate distance between that blue sphere and all the RNA oftens that surround it and based on those distances because we could actually compute atomic fingerprint so for every option we could compute because we believe that these are ideas which correspond to these yellow lines into this equation here and it gives us this number that gives us Meishan about the contacts it makes with specific ovens that surround it right now we put every autumn in the ligand right we can assign specific autumn types to those ovens and so we we actually separately right determine this atomic fingerprint for each physic autumn type and then we could come up with a molecular fingerprint where we kind of combine all this information for all of the atoms group based on their autumn tights into a fixed length vector that describes the interaction between the RNA and the small molecule this hot retention shape - here we're not so this is not we're not doing docking so what we're doing is saying okay given a particular poles right and we predict whether or not that pose is near native or non-native and so he would do docking first and then this will be a force filtering type of approach and so from the under poses you can even get access to this molecular fingerprint you feed it into some model and it tells you based on the fingerprint whether or not that poses naked like right so we're building classifies to estimate the native nipple deposit so use a random forest technique let's get through it'll be here because I think most of you in this don't probably have a sense of all this work essentially what we have is a CO as an ensemble of decision trees Maestri we feed in our features and we pass it through the tree and at the end were able to put some probability of whether or not that pulls is correct so we have multiple of these and so we average or given set of features we would average the result from each one of each of the trees so we trained our classifiers on the data set based on a tRNA ligand complexes but each system we generated 600 those --is some of them naked like some of them non-native and here we're using the definition of native life is anything less than 2 angstroms away from the known structure so we talked about the army ligand complex structure and so and we did all this in a ska learn um I'm just going to show you a number of comparisons between the actual and predicted polls so on the left you have the actual polls and then on the right you have the predictive code and I'll go through them one by one so this is the case where the classifier failed to recover a pose that was actually in the pocket so the reason why there's nothing here is because the marquee is docked someplace else like then this will be an example of failure yes we know the example of failure the you know the actual of the small molecule in the actual structure is on the surface whereas in our structure is kind of buried inside someplace but for the rich you can see a pretty good agreement between the actual and predicted forces there are cases where there might be some issues related to the orientation of the small molecule but for the most part we get in this structure is correct and so here all you've done is various classifiers and now what we do is feed in features based on a molecular featuring a french and output probabilities that they were native like and then rank that lists and then identify the ones that have the highest core and these are the ones that we call the predicted polls and so you've seen the results here so one of the you know one of the questions you have when you utilize these kinds of machine learning approaches is whether or not you've learnt anything that might be transferable right this is a question that I've always want to struggle to answer but kind of rebelled against because breasts very often we have a very specific goal where we'll be trying a specific question that we're after or task in the task in this case is just to be able to predict the structure accurately alright so one school of thought would be once you're able to accurately predict the structure while care about inside transferability and interpretability and also the doing important analysis right so recently we started to actually think a little bit more about exploring our models a little bit more in trying to challenge them and so one of the things you could imagine doing is the test transferability you could you could you take a related problem and try to use the classifiers to address them right so here's an example where we have this RNA right this is a fragment of an RNA from soft and Ammar structure these are these two residues and we have a set of decoy structures where the residues have alternate positions right and so well if you treat one of these residues as a ligand right you can actually make use of this in the framework that we used to predict rn8 small molecule pulses to actually try to resolve these these because here and so what we did it for these residues we treated each as a ligand passed it through the same classifiers that were trained on only RNA small molecules data and at the end for every structure we get a score and we asked whether or not the structure that had the highest score actually the correct structures and the ones that have lower scores or the indirect charges good CATIA range is the structures that have the highest classification scores so the top the top five and then the bottom the bottom five and we had about a hundred of these structures and so you can see for the structure that have the low pacification schools there are third disagreement between the actual and predicted structure so this is an example where we train this model only exclusively an RNA small molecule they don't write extended to related problems right and to do that we had to simply treat each residues individually as a ligand and then use the same infrastructure we used for classifying our enolate impulsive this is something we're actually now trying for proteins right so we could take every residue in a protein treated as a ligand right and then classify that residue in an RNA going to RNA protein complex the challenge is how exactly do we combine these probabilities for a protein that has multiple multiple multiple residues right one Pro to be to treat them as independent right where the probabilities even or you treat them as independent right so we haven't figure but it's kind of interesting this is so in a sense if you look at but here we have this restraint term that depends both on the term of dynamic energy and the restraint that we're providing right so this is Anita hybrid right a contains information about the general physics of the interactions but also this information that we got from our chemicals yes so tuning the strength of the the this restrain term relative to the trauma the autonomic component of the trend if all the free energy would dictate exactly which one dominates right so that becomes a hyper gravity itself which has to be optimized but indeed this is actually hard to approach so yes so we haven't because whenever we're doing is very problem driven meaning that okay we want to predict like our conditional condition they predict the structure of an RNA we've kind of focused on that a lot right but I think there are opportunities to try to improve the the folding out rate that's based on this kind of approach right where you can probably tweak the parameters such that we are able to reproduce the results when you get when you utilize this hybrid model this is the some some of the tools that we've developed along the way you have this yes to structure tool which is what allows us to go from chemical shifts the secondary structure so this encompasses what we talked about in the beginning we also have a tool lamar d which allows us to get chemical shift from 3d structure and so this allows us to then compute chemical shifts from the 3d on instruction and compare them to experiments and be able to make some guesses as to what the structure might be we've recently developed this tool called pi shifts which is a thermal plugin that allows us to analyze biomolecular ensembles based on chemical shifts so you feed in the structure the computer chemical shift from the structure projects the chemical share error on to the structure and you can analyze exactly where you see disagreement so this is a tool that we think may be useful to help guide and map the analysis of biomolecular frumble also there's some clustering in chemical shift States or essentially cluster based on chemical shifts which has the advantage of not because the chemical shifts we utilize depend on young distances then you don't have to worry about aligning structures to ensure that you remove this component from the earth in the first ring and then RNA poses is the encapsulate the patter prize that I talked about that we used by the RNA ligand puzzle so we're actually also working on this science gate 3 working with the exe program and the answer and so we called structure based machine learning tools for RNA and so the idea is that users will come in and upload structure and then we use a barrier or to be able to make some predictions based on spectra so there's some that is that in the works does not yet live but the reason I'd put it up here because I think for those of you who also do tool development you might also also might also want to consider utilizing this facility from the NSF that allows you to build these science gateways that gives users access to your tools the cool thing about this is that they actually consult with you and they really guide you through this process right and so they do a lot of the heavy lifting so if you if you don't tools I want to consider using a accede to help you defy some of them so we're going to shift gears now we're not going to talk in the time I have remaining we're going to talk about not data driven approaches but I guess physics driven approaches don't them talk about some of the tools or tool we've developed for automatics and lations of complex processes and biological processes I unfortunately big use on plane right you don't get to see all the fun videos that I that we created right but if you could this is what you would see right so we have this out this is an example of this complex here he to keep tube down to this small molecule and here we show the residence time right this is the time that I'm average this small molecule would spend on cdk2 this is an excess of 7,000 seconds so this is a very long time scale process and so we you know wanted to use the modes of dynamics and there are lots of interest in using molecular dynamics techniques to kind of simulate this kind of complex process now so we initiated about 20 simulations the length each of them was about 250 nano seconds he's in mismatch between these timescales the wall time required to these simulations was about just over a hundred hours and we're able to observe zero and binding events all right and this is a typical scenario where you have these long time scale processes and you're trying to simulate them using conventional MV simulations the based on this residence time right it will take 3 5 28 years to actually simulate this process right and I don't have that kind of time so the reason for this mismatch is because of there are these barriers that separate regions in space right so you have here say your kind of simulate the transition between these two states in this region a finish engine you the reason why the simulations healed unbinding advances because essentially we're stuck in this region here and these barriers are very high relative to determinate in your system so what's happening is that most list of all of the submission time is spent in this region here and you never actually see this escape but there's the disk product region to the X and one how would you solve this problem they would say obviously just lower the barrier right this you can actually do that like you could scale the potential and lower this barrier and you can actually increase your probability of seeing these kinds of transitions now that if you were to do this right where you take your system and you do complete scaling of your potential and your potential just this mathematical equation that takes in your structure and outputs forces and energies right which are used to propagate the dynamics using classical mechanics you see unfolding right well you would see I'm pulling in the video plays right um but we don't want that right so one of the solutions is to actually do central scaling where you restrain most of the region around your pocket so in this magenta here but you keep flexible the region where you're interested in seeing where the ligand is actually found and so if you do that you can actually see on binding events and really really rapidly depending on the extent to which you lower this barrier here now the problem is is that there can be instances where in order for this ligand to unbind you have to add some conformational change somewhere else far away from the from the binding pocket right so this kind of approach would actually fail in those kind of scenarios so when we were after we approaches that allow us to simulate these kinds of dissociative processes the way we didn't include we don't have things with any kind of restraints on our system so our approaches who do something simple we decided that if we could make the interactions between Ligon and water stronger right that should actually accelerate the weight of unbinding because what happened is that the water of the Russian to the binding pocket and exchanged the ligand curtain contacts with ligand water contacts and then the couple the ligand from the the protein or the receptor and leave right now you might ask okay well yeah that seems like an indirect approach to to do with why not just reduce the interactions between the ligand and protein right but indeed we try this initially and you can imagine if you have a ligand that's really really deep inside of some very inside a pocket giving the interactions will indeed decouple the protein and the small molecule right the problem is is that the ligand becomes trapped inside of the protein because what has to happen as well is that the protein has to open up to let the leg enough leave as well so by filling up water ligand interactions we actually do two things when we make we replace the protein ligand contact with protein water contacts where we progressively make the ligand bigger and so it kind of well and pushed pushes open the protein that allows the ligand to leave so this is how we do the scaling so we have we scale the lennard-jones potential which is shown here and this via case where we have giving parameter alpha Prime and I J corresponds to the item in the ligand and the j-pop and in the in the in the wallet and this would be a case in the arm scale for ten here and we could scale them such that we increase this web depth which makes the interactions between the water and ligand more favorable you can do this a number you can do this a number of different scale values right when you make this depth this well def keeper so we did again empty it but this is what you would see here is the conventional simulation of the of the of the complex and then what we call a selectively skill simulation where we selectively spill the water ligand interactions and you see this ligand actually leaves in a very short-term relation time whereas the ligand here stays inside of them yeah they were separate and so we publish this work briefly as a way to accelerate the unwinding that we've also along with this introduced to extrapolation techniques by doing the extrapolation techniques well because we're accelerating time right events happen faster than it normally would right so we have to find a way to be able to estimate what the kinetics what the kinetics will observe would be if we didn't scale the potential so we have these extrapolation methods where we run simulations at different scaling values and they extrapolate the results to the case where we don't have any daily kind of attention and that allows us to make some estimates about the kinetics and as well determine dynamics of the process of study again this should be but we have one of the things we wanted you know we're interest an RNAi I've shown you some protein work there right this was just for developing the tools but wanted to fight an RNA and so we had this FMN ribose which which is a ribose which for ribose switches are in general these are any elements that can bind to a specific metabolites or a ligand in in what's called the optimal domain right and lock the iron it is confirmation that prevents it from sequestering a sequence in what's called the expression platform right Luca connects sequester the sequence then it prevents our transcription and translation right and the ABS ALPA small-molecule most requests raishin of that difference happens and so you can have normal transcription and translation of the amount of the mRNA and so again this slide didn't show up as it should but kind of highlight that so one of the things is important when thinking about bio switches in general is that the ability for regulate gene expression is really a complex relationship between the relative rate of folding of the optimal domain then the rate of ligament and Association the association and then also the rate of transcription because what happens is that first you transcribe the Optima it folds and then transcribe the expression platform right there is this time between which you have to make this decision as to whether or not the you're gonna terminate the transcription or translation right which is dictated by the rate at which the expression platform is formed alright so if you have a smell mallet either binds to the ACMA domain and moves very quickly right they're still potential for the arrival search to make an alternate decision the rest my molecules that they are just more on the optimal domain long enough to kind of exit that decision window so we have here I'm showing you at all examples of these by molecules that bind to the F in the ribose which you have the carbonate ligand here so this is the earth Ament and this is the this is an image of the crystal structure with a binding pocket and then you have ribosome which is active meaning that it actually is able to compete for FM n and actually inhibit the regulatory process that FM n controls and has been shown to actually inhibit bacterial replication right so there's a lot of interest in using this as a potential antimicrobial the problem is is that bacteria quickly develop resistance right cuz it can be chained quickly so you can make the residues that contact ligand but it's a good model system to study molecular recognition and in general structure activity relationships in RNA the third small molecule is wg3 which is an inactive now if you look at the kinetics of their their dissociation but the association of the cognate ligand is very slow or there's small molecule which was by the way was discovered by by our mark doing while they were doing a field of the big screen it's faster then the chaos is faster than element and for this an active compound the results that were obtained experimentally are kind of inconclusive right the one suggestion is that we as I kind of made the argument at kinetics plays an important role it could be that what's happening is there's four molecule binds but it has a high payoff right so the rate of the associate is high so we could in principle therefore use our selectively scale and assimilation to study the unbinding of these ligands and so that's what we did on let's go again movie you would see demonstration of the fact that we can use our selective scaling approaches actually similarly on binding of the small molecules at the end you'll see the small molecule leaving now the utility of this is that we can do contact analysis right for a number of replicas so we can run these simulations that say 50 times and at each time we can ask what's the probability of the ligand being unbound right and you could come up with these kinds of probability traces so this is the trace you get for FMN right so it takes about 50 nano seconds at the scale value that we use for the simulation for all our contacts to be lost and so at that stage the probability of mining is one super driver so it's this blue curve here and the wd3 which is that inactive molecule you can see this profile suggests that it is unbind strategy right so the hypothesis that emerges from our and that our simulations to the fact that is that the LG g3 is enacted because of the fact that it undines rapidly from the afternoon right and so the system has enough time to actually make an alternative decision when it's trying to regulate between going termination and termination of transcription and whether or not it's going to go ahead and actually execute transmission so this is where hypothesis and probably is to be tested arm but it kind of highlights how we can potentially use our selectively scale and assimilation right so imagine again we're interested in virtual screening what we would do is being a large ad with compounds apply a bunch of filters and necessarily at the end have I don't know 100 compounds that were interested in advancing to experimental tests before you do that we can actually run them through this type of stimulation pipeline where we predict these profiles and focus on the ones that have the kind of kinetics that were interested in in this case we'll probably focus of the compounds that have a profile that looks in what they're from and where the environment is delayed relative to the other compounds now this sounds fine that the problem is that these simulations still take about for each compound so it takes about two weeks right to actually execute the things we could imagine doing is actually creating machine learning models that can reproduce the kinetics and cummin dynamics you get from the simulation so that you can make these predictions much faster i and so that's one of directions that were take and with that thank you [Applause] thank you
