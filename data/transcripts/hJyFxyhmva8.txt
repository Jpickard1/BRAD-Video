hmm and this is a new seminar series emerging questions and quantitative biology where hopefully twice a semester we'll get together to ask about some of the bigger questions in the field the goal is to think about the topic kind of a yep bigger questions level so the speakers are each going to have 10 or 15 minutes kind of give an introduction tell you a little bit about their work and how it relates so today's topic is emergent properties and biology so for as an example there's our area of a rain forest in Thailand where the fireflies are known for blinking in sync so they all flashing off on and off together and so the kind of questions this field deals with our how does this order emerge from disorder emergence is that refers to the existence or formulate formation of collective behaviors and like what parts of the system can do together that they can't do alone so our three speakers are Jordans mature Beckett's Turner and Carl Simon and I will George take it over thank you very much thank you for the invitation it's a great pleasure to be here I also had the pleasure of participating in the first session of the neuroscience program of these greater questions so thanks very much for having me so I'm gonna be talking about consciousness and general anesthesia and how we literally disintegrate consciousness when we give general anesthetics and as a disclaimer I was on call at the hospital last night doing this very thing so if I seem a little out of it that's why so I'm gonna just I'm gonna give you the main message right up front the first statement is that spatio-temporal integration of neural information is at least necessary for consciousness and I feel pretty comfortable making that claim because of two known facts one is an experiential fact and the experiential fact is that our experience of the world our phenomenal processing of the world is unified so if you're looking at the Sun you're not experiencing its shape and its color and its warmth at different time points it's integrated so we have a unity of consciousness as it's often referred to the other known fact is that the brain has functional specialization different areas of the brain specialize in different processing modalities so there's primary sensory cortices vision the auditory cortex and then there are seven modalities so within vision color it could be motion so the brain has a kind of division of labor so unified experience division of labor in the brain means there's got to be some mechanism of integration that happens in the brain in order to get all these parts together such that we have a unified experience so if this is necessary for consciousness if I need X to get Y then if I take X away I should also take Y away the corollary would be that disruption of this integration is sufficient for unconsciousness and what I'll show you today is that general anesthetics and common clinical use disrupt brain networks and thus reduce the capacity per integration now I'm not going to be talking directly about emergence today and we can maybe talk about it later but it is thought that this integration and unconsciousness itself is an emergent property so let me give you some examples of why consciousness is not just localized to one area of the brain and this is sometimes referred to in the science of consciousness as contrasted analysis so you deliver a sensory stimulus at around threshold where you might or might not perceive it and then you contrast the state of the brain when you do see it or hear it or feel it versus when you don't and this is an auditory task and what you can see here over on this side this is a functional magnetic resonance energy you can see that when the stimulus is delivered in even when it's not detected there's still activation of the posterior half of the superior temporal gyrus and I don't know if we have people in neuroscience in the room but if we do you'll know that that's the site of the primary auditory cortex so that information is still getting into the brain it's still getting processed in that primary area and yet we're not having a conscious experience of it by contrast when you detect the sound you see a much more widespread activation that prominently involved the prefrontal cortex so this is the front of the brain and the posterior parietal cortex and this is where your primary motor cortex and your somatosensory cortex are now that's not just true of the auditory modality it's also true of the visual modality and this is now an electric physiological study basically looking at about potentials and this is v1 or the primary visual cortex and you can see that activation these evoke potentials in v1 and even higher areas of the visual cortex are not sufficient for visual consciousness what you need again is this more extended network and the network the the information doesn't get transferred just in one direction so there's a well known feed-forward pathway in the brain when you're processing something in the visual system but there also a number of recurrent or reentrant processes and it's thought that these recurrent re-entrant processes are very important for integrating information and important for consciousness itself so now I'm going to give you some parallels or rather anti parallels when it comes to anesthetic induced unconsciousness just as consciousness is not correlated with activation at the level of the primary sensory cortex neither is anesthetic induced unconsciousness correlated with deactivation of those areas so this is a experimental paradigm and human volunteers who are getting the intravenous drug propofol which is a fabulous drug that's got a bad rap because of Michael Jackson it's a great drug just make sure your anesthesiologist is getting it to you and not your cardiologist so these subjects they're in a state of wakefulness propofol induced unconsciousness and you don't need to be a neuroradiologist or a cognitive neuroscientist to see that these these areas aren't really changing they're relatively unperturbed and what you're looking at here this is a transfer section of the brain of sagittal section this is primary visual cortex and these are the primary auditory cortices and they're relatively unprepared just as these more extended fronto-parietal networks are associated with conscious processing so too is their deactivation associated with unconsciousness and I've given you examples from slowly sleep again prefrontal area posterior parietal that's the the lateral side and that's in the middle of the brain and you can see that they're deactivated that blue is a deactivation during slow-wave sleep anesthesia and this is also true for certain coma states and vegetative States just as consciousness is not associated with these earlier about potentials from primary sensory areas but rather later about potentials from more integrative activity so - with general anesthesia this is a rodent experiment with visual evoked potentials and this is the inhaled anesthetic death blurring and you can see quite clearly with increasing concentrations of the drug this is probably around where you would start to become unconscious you see these early potentials reflecting primary visual cortex they're relatively unperturbed they're still doing their thing whereas the later more integrative potentials show a robust dose response curve so actually unexpectedly about five people from my lab locked in right people with the talk so I'll give them credit later but they've done some more translating some of the findings and animals looking at the way different parts of the brain and in particular this frontal parietal Network communicates during consciousness and anesthesia and this is tricky business to try to figure out causal influence in terms of one brain region on another but we use a number of techniques related to functional connectivity directed or directional connectivity and effective connectivity and this technique is called symbolic transfer entry and this was done in human surgical patients were getting induced with different anesthetics and this is their baseline state this is when anesthesia is getting induced level of surgical anesthesia or recovery and post recovery in action out of the operating room in the recovery room and what you're looking at here in the stripe varsity back more these integrative processes versus feed-forward the more primary sensory processes and you can see in humans and this is in contrast to rap data which I haven't shown you this this backward connection dominates in the waking State compared to the feed-forward and what you can see is this communication gets suppressed start to getting suppressed when the patient starts receiving the drug and that directionality is is suppressed both going to the prefrontal cortex and coming out of it in the anesthetized state you start to see it recover when the drug is wearing off and then it returns the baseline and post recovery so we've done a number of different studies this has been confirmed with a very meticulous protocol and healthy volunteers and I've just given you a summary cartoon here prefrontal cortex posterior parietal cortex feedback and feed-forward a connectivity measured with EEG and also functional connectivity measured with MRI and what was found to be the best discriminator between consciousness and unconsciousness with a loss of the frontal two parietal feedback connectivity so there seems to be something very important about the way different parts of the brain communicate to generate consciousness this is another commonly used anesthetic actually we've just published this it just came out yesterday called feeble chlorine again we looked at healthy volunteers and you're looking at a number of different functional connections across the cortex the frontal and parietal frontal temporal and frontal occipital areas and you can see a significant reduction in the unconscious state broadly across the cortex these are seven individual subjects going from the baseline contrast state to the state of unconsciousness in the state of recovery this is another method of assessing a connections what is the metric for conscious let me ask you a question I'll ask all of you a question first of all do you think that I'm conscious you sound ambivalent about baguette yes or no it's not a trick question yes you do you think so why do you think so okay good so you've gotten this was not a plant he actually came up with that spontaneously so we are making inferences consciousness by definition I don't want to take up the whole hour and a half just talking about the definition but consciousness by definition is subjectivity right I mean it's it's a subjective first-person perspective so very weirdly in the science of consciousness we really only have an N of one because I'm privy to one and only one experience and that's my own everything else I'm making inferences based on behavior and so as you point out this responsiveness usually works well as a gauge we're always making inferences based on behavior and responsiveness and that's just what we do here so in humans were asking them to follow a command but I'm not going to get into it we could talk about it later but responsiveness and consciousness are definitely dissociable okay so again more evidence that there's a breakdown of network communication and network connectivity now this won't mean that much to you but it means a lot to us and anesthesiology and and maybe even some people in neuroscience and that is that these drugs like propofol and SIBO chlorine and desflurane that are commonly used to induce unconsciousness they depress neuronal activity so you know what it's not all that surprising that they would depress neuronal communication but drugs like ketamine that have you heard of ketamine I mean ketamine something that's known in popular culture as well drugs like had amine actually activate the cortex so it is less obvious that they would necessarily depress communication between different areas of the brain but again we apply this metric of symbolic transfer entropy and I've depicted it in a different way but you're looking at the axis of time here this is the feedback connectivity from frontal deprival cortex this is board comprised old frontal this blue shaded area is when in this case an N of 30 or receiving the drug and you can see that drop a feedback and activity so even though the brain is getting activated the cortex is getting activated and higher frequency activities going up communication is going down so the network is getting fragmented and this is a different measure of directional connectivity directed phase lag index and you can see in the conscious state again any of these backward arrows representing activity that are basically gone after ketamine is in the brain so to summarize consciousness requires integration it's a it's a necessary condition now there are some neuroscience is one in particular Giulio Tononi who thinks that integrated information is consciousness it's not just necessary not even just sufficient it is consciousness there's an identity relationship and the reason why I'm pointing that out is because I think it touches on some of the questions of emergence where for Toni and for others there's something causally irreducible about this integrated information it's giving you something above and beyond what any of these individual areas are processing in terms of information and in that respect it is an emergent phenomenon and then general anesthetics may induce unconsciousness by disrupting disintegration so just quick quickly acknowledge the lab dr. Anjali is here dr. Junior moon these are physicists and network scientists we also have Brian Silverstein and Brenna and MK some undergrads and graduate students who all contributed to this and also just quickly thank NIH McDonald foundation and some other sources for funding thank you very much and oh well I it's it's up it's up to these two you know you're really you're getting right at me here I don't know I don't know if what's that well I'm defining consciousness and simply by talking about integration I'm talking about a necessary condition you know what you're talking about I know exactly what you're talking about yes sir the great question so using this framework no we don't know I mean these these measures of communication and connectivity you know I finished my training in anesthesiology in 2006 there is maybe one or two papers since that point since I've come on faculty here this has really just started to evolve and especially trying to understand where the communication piece of it if you get back to early 20th century and throughout the 20th century at a very molecular mechanistic aspect there are certain ways of trying to predict that but not not in an a priori fashion because in fact one of the foundational questions is why do all of these structurally and pharmacologically and neuro physiologically diverse drugs all seem to do the same thing I think could have stopped talking thank you all right can you all hear me great thank you so much for coming today I'm really excited to be here and thanks to Laura and Shweta so putting together series I am coming from the philosophy department I'm a foster of biology so in fact Fosters have been talking about issues of reduction emergence alongside scientists from several decades and what I'm going to do here is set aside a lot of that debate just to focus on a particular case of how reduction drives research forward in systems biology alright so when a lot of people talk about what reduction or emergence are they tend to think of it as a static relationship either between two theories such as classical mechanics and general relativity or between properties you might think of the behaviors of a cell as a set of properties at a higher level and then the properties of the molecules that make up the cell at a lower level and if there's reduction then that means that whatever the cell is doing at the higher level can be predicted or explained by the molecular constituents at the lower level or if you think they're emergent than you think they're unpredictable or unexplainable and so there are sort of two general types of how reduction is thought to happen one is between the higher and the lower level like the cell and at the parts that's what philosophers called inter level and then there's also successional reduction that would be the example of class in classical mechanics to general relativity where general relativity replaces and modifies but saves a lot of the original insights and results of classical mechanics and what I'm going to be talking about today is primarily interloper duction and to set to take an alternative view instead of just thinking about static relationships between already well-established secure theories or particular properties that we think are out there in nature let's set reduction and emergence in motion so to speak let's think about them as strategies for doing scientific research so what does it mean to take reduction as a kind of methodology for generating new predictions and explanations about cell biology for example and so within reduction as a methodology there are certain heuristics that biologists often take advantage of I think we're coming up in George's talk in terms of thinking about what a cell does in terms of analyzing it into a set of sub functions so for example if you think about a cell trying to move up a chemical gradient to a source of food the cell has to be able to sense the gradient it has to be able to direct its motion and it has to be able to coordinate changes in its location with the motion that it pursues so those are all sub functions for the overall capacity to move up the gradient towards the source of food and then what you might want to do is well say is say well I know this cell has to have these sub functions but where are they in the cell right I want to figure out what part of the cell is carrying out each of these sub functions and so you might look at the membrane to find protein complexes that will help explain how the cell is sensing the chemical gradient and then you might look for regulatory mechanisms inside of it that help explain how it coordinates that integrates the change in gradient over time and then coordinates its response with the flagella and then finally what's typical of a reductive strategy is that you think that all you need to explain how a cell behaves at the higher level is knowledge of its parts and then you can set aside environmental variation that's to say that whatever the baver behavior is that you're trying to predict or explain at the level of the whole can be treated as intrinsic to the properties of the parts and their combination so part of what I want to raise today is a question of what are limitations of taking this strategy for organizing scientific research as a particular method and the the case that I'm going to give to kind of develop this more concretely is to talk about contemporary approaches to finding a theory for systems biology in particular how do you explain the behavior of cells in terms of gene networks and the structures of gene Network all right so there's our goal we want to try and explain and predict things like how chemotaxis how does the cell move up a gradient toward a source of food and here are parts right we have these kinds of molecules which are each node and their causal interactions so we might have genes that are up or down regulating their expression levels and we want to be able to say why the cell does what it does and how it does it by looking at the organization of this network and picking out particular elements that help us make sense of the complex behavior and so what is a reductive Theory amount to here well the hope is that it's not just that you have to take the gene network and then simulate the whole thing and whatever the output is is the best you can do right at the sort of explanation but it's a low-level explanation maybe there are these parts in the middle these higher-level components to the network that have distinctive functions that explain the overall success of the network in solving certain kinds of design problems like how do you move up a chemical gradient and that there to sort of major proposals out here along with others I'm just going to focus on motifs for the rest of the talk okay and so the hope is that we could find these mid-level components of functional organization and network and then use that to generate explanatory principles that tell us why the network is the way it is given the kinds of things that a cell has to do to survive and adapt in a changing environment so what are motifs what we have here are ways of breaking down the overall network into different patterns of causal interactions right and so motifs are usually defined in terms of the number of nodes they have and then the pattern of edges so if we just think about all of the motifs with three nodes then there's a total of three but sorry 13 possible combinations if we don't pay attention to what the causal interactions are actually doing right to get a fully specified motif we have to go down several more layers of specification to really say what the overall like the detailed structure of the interactions are so it's not enough to just have arrows we need to say that the arrows are either increasing or decreasing the expression level of the genes involved and really it's not even enough to say that because what happens when we have two arrows converging in the same gene Z here well we have to know how they fit together right and so a lot of this work that I'm talking about is coming out of urea loans lab and Israel starting from this well-known paper in science from 2002 and the way that alone at all model this is to take an analogy from electrical circuits and say that the expression levels of these two genes combined as an and function so if X is going to change the expression level V then both x and y have to be above some threshold level of expression for their effects to kick in and for the the level of V to increase and then we also need to say how the motif hooks up to the rest of the network so these would be external verb edges coming in from the rest of the network that set or influence the expression levels of X&Y so just to break this down we have the intrinsic causal structure right the pattern of network interaction but then alone at all want motifs to have a robust role function in the network so they have some kind of behavior that happens independently of the conditions that the network puts the motif in I'll give a brief example of that in the next slide and then finally that these patterns should be there because of what they do for the cell right not randomly not because of neutral variation produced by mutations of gene duplication but because they solve some kind of evolutionary design problem and so one example would be of a robust role function would be this sort of motif which has an effect that alone at all call a sign-sensitive delay element and basically what it means is that if there's flux if you hook it up to the the edge of the cell so it's sensing that chemical gradient and there's fluctuations in the chemical gradient over time the motif filters out short fluctuations and only responds only up regulate Z if there's a sustained change in the concentration outside the cell and so in that way if the cell has to start making expensive decisions like where to go or starting to process a new sugar it's advantageous for it an evolutionary term if it only responds when there's indeed a significant and sustained change outside of it so if that's what a mo Keef is right how do we find them how do we test the idea that these sorts of small little calls interactions are actually an adequate vocabulary to decompose a whole cell into a parts and then be able to explain the networks organization the first step that alone at all pursued was to say we want to look for these small bits of causal interactions that are over enriched in the network compared to some sort of background expectation right and so what they did is they take take the G network and then they rearranged each of the edges in the G network preserving the number of incoming and outgoing edges for each node and the idea is that you're basically erasing the functionality of the G network right the cell probably isn't going to survive if you did you know all of the original connectivity is between those different genes have been rearranged to be quite different but hopefully what you will detect if you compare the frequency of these patterns in the actual network to the ones in a set of randomized network is which motifs are in the actual network more often than you expect based on a network that wasn't functional so the idea here is that this is the first step to taking all these possible motifs and filtering out the ones that aren't there because of evolutionary history and just focusing in on the ones like and I at least it's made up data in this case just for simplicity like this pattern right or this pattern which seemed to be over expressed and maybe have some kind of evolutionary history I've been selected for in the past now the question and this takes us back from thinking that we can do everything with these parts of the network to the idea that context and environment matters the question here is whether or not this kind of null model is really adequate right is it going to pick out all and only the motifs that are capturing the organization of G network and a fairly extensive methodological discussion after your alone original work their first work in this matter has brought out several ways in which that randomization procedure that I talked about to generate the null model in fact isn't really precise enough right and could easily lead to incorrect conclusions about what the important motifs are in a network and in order to understand how to get a more accurate null model we have to understand the evolutionary processes that are generating variation the cell as a whole and that are selecting on certain motifs to increase their frequency and so if we have chromosome duplications or gene duplications than the occurrence of motifs or interactions between genes are going to be correlated right they're not statistically independent events I can't count them I see five motifs and they've all been produced from the same genome duplication then I can't count them as five separate events I have to download it somehow but if I don't have that notion of the possibility of a criminal duplication in my null model I just look at the structure of the gene network itself then I'm not going to be able to accurately estimate what extent those motifs are over enriched so to wrap up a couple thoughts on how reduction and emergence might fit together in dynamic terms right as methodological approaches for research in science so for one thing after looking at attempts to reduce one theory or a set of properties to another theory or a set of properties it's really the case that scientists have actually abandoned the historical or alternative approach it's not like we're going to stop doing cell biology because now we have gene networks and part of the issue is that we need to be able to know what the cell is doing and how it behaves in order to understand whether the attempt at reduction the the proposal that motifs are a theory for systems biology is actually successful and so what I've just given is a little example in terms of talking about well here's this idea for the structure of gene networks but how do we discover whether there are motifs what we actually need to know about the larger context for the cell and how it all is it's an example of a back and forth between the higher and lower level approach to cell behavior and it might be that if motifs don't work out in the end they're going to teach us something about how the cell can't be decomposed into certain kind of simple set of units and instead we have to think of them as a more complex structure for example you might say that cellular localization of the gene products of gene networks matters a lot and gene networks tend to just wipe that away right they don't care about spatial localization so it might be that the right sort of gene Network model is going to have to include a higher level of organization in the cell beyond just interactions between genes and then once we understand the cell at that new level in that new way this can actually drive new attempts at explaining and predicting its behavior in terms of part so in that sense treating cells emergent and treating cells with reductive when we think of it in a dynamic way produces a positive feedback and just as something to chew on one way to understand the consequence or implication of this back and forth is to say that good reduction should anticipate its own failure right if you're going to embark on a project like motifs or embark on a claim that to take the Human Genome Project as a straw man we can understand organisms based just on their DNA in order to do that research well you need to think about how it's going to fail and how to make that failure significant rather than just the obvious observation that well actually how we use our genes matters and we knew that environment made an influence so it wasn't ever going to be true that genomes were sufficient to understand everything about organism but what is it teaching us when that particular attempt failed and so in that sense emergence shouldn't be thought of as the energy that's the enemy all right thank you [Applause] so I don't know any specific work that's been done using motifs or modularity to address that question but the kind of point that you would want to raise is for example if you think about modules the the value of modules is that what they do is relatively isolated from the rest of the cell so if you disrupt another part of the cell or if you disrupt another part of the cell then you might hope that that module other modules will continue to function and that might help give you insight in terms of what happens when you cannulate mutations over time that disrupts the structure of the network no not in the sense of completely separated but in the sense of the idea that the network is relative is near decomposable so that there are the clusters of interactions that are relatively more integrated with each other than with the rest of the network and so in that sense whatever is going on inside the module can be studied somewhat independently it can bracket what's going on the network somewhat independently but right it loses its function when the other modules are not connected right of course thank you you know I can't give you an exact citation but I know a couple years back there was a publication of you know a model a computational model of the function of a full cell and it was you know one of these cells that has some 500 genes so it's really parasitic and so it's a very small model but I'm not sure about the inner workings because if those involved these modules then it's possible that even if it doesn't correspond exactly one to one about the biology is you're still useful even if you know in reality you know understanding the limitations for instance you know it's still useful to do these things I don't know still useful to build the model exactly yeah yeah no and and paper do you know that they involved these modules at all I've heard about work trying to simulate whole cells but I don't know the specific paper I mean part yeah part of in order to build a model of the whole cell you have to compartmentalize it and make a whole bunch of partially conflicting idealizations about what on to say that there are limitations to reduction of an research strategy doesn't mean that it's not worth pursuing or hasn't been incredibly valuable rather it's to ask how can we be smart about this given the ways that it's been used in the past and been seen to fail and so the the positive story there is in fact there are good ways to think intelligently about what it means to try and decompose a cell into its functional units in a way that will help you anticipate how it might fail and make those failures scientifically significant rather than just oh well that was too simple we knew that from the start now we have to try something else thank you thank you a pleasure to be here I think thank the organizers and I must say some of the most memorable talks I've heard at the University and been in this room organized by the people in this room so I'm actually have some overlap with Beckett's talk but I'm at a completely different level a more macro level so I'm a math modeler sometimes for hire a little bit like a gunslinger for hire and you know I love guns and I always thought through the world's greatest thing model but I as I'm maturing a little bit I'm beginning to understand that there are some concerns we should think about as we do our our modeling especially the macro level modelling that I mostly think about so the basic thing I think we all agree the reason for modelling is everything's a system okay and ignoring this fact sort of leads to possible unintended consequences look what did I do here I just had an unintended consequence hit the bottom button oh I see okay my thumb is too big for this little thing so failures a system sinking may be the clearest example is a DDP and and or you're bringing the wild rabbits to Australia I'm gonna run through these very quickly because they're all sort of so obvious but from the health point of view you know having a going to your kids ears or kids screaming of their infection and you go to a doctor and say give me the strong as possible medicine or and and again or using antibiotic soaps all these you know have unintended consequences for promoting drug resistance plenty more plenty more example to think about you I sometimes when I give this to a class I couldn't for homework that they should make three examples of unintended consequences from failing to take a systems point of view and so it sort of systems approaches I think that separates college from high school okay completely high school you learn that Columbus discovered America and what 1776 no one of those years and you know and and and and college you understand you know what the goals were what the search was and and you try to you look for the mechanism what why and how not when so in building a model the idea is you start with some key variables you look at the links between them you try and understand them maybe try and quantify them and the result should be a model and there are many different kinds and that's one of the things I want to talk about heuristic models computer models and I'll come back to that so [Music] maybe this is a more this is why I think modeling is crucial and made me each one of us in the room here work with models have their own special niche in this list so I'm gonna spend a few minutes looking at it some of these are I think very straightforward some of these are much more complicated so for example data collection you know when HIV I'm mostly going to talk about HIV but when HIV first hit the news and the in the around 1980 the you know we wanted to find out what was wrong what was happening we'd send people out to ask questions I thought they asked all their questions were rather useless for understanding what was happening it was only after we built a model and try to understand what we needed to know that we began to ask the questions or or solving and understanding the process the fourth one is the one that lets see actually it's the third one that I will talk about most and that parameter estimation there are a lot of things that happen in say the spread of an infection and parameters like contagiousness like duration like network structure and some of these that you just can't especially those you can't see building a model is a crucial step the paper I'm working on all last night because the deadline is yesterday I was trying to understand the role of asymptomatic and infection in the spread of gonorrhea okay you can't really talk about using that using data measured because in general we don't know the whole point of its asymptomatic so building a model comparing the data has enabled us to really understand that maybe gonorrhea is close to 100% contagious when you pull it when you put the asymptomatic pieces in so parts of these are pretty straightforward making forecasts but we know we have to be careful look at all the various forecasts of Ebola how many of them were close - right - anyway so this is the part that turns me on it gets me very excited but it and I want to in the rest of the hour I have I want to talk a little bit about what worked and what doesn't okay so the basic you know when he builds a model di for me working from a macro point of view unlike the micro point of view that that could just describe I want to start with the very simplest parts I had a student who wanted to came in wanted to model the spread of crime which and Beckett became a very seductive process for me and he came in and he showed me you know 50 pages of paper of model of stuff and I said yoga when we finally got it down to three components we began to make progress and then we got it back up to 50 but I think building started from from from small pieces so yeah here's here's the KISS principle keep it simple stupid the KISS principle in action probably not quite true but so what when well in some sense the simplest approach has always been the biostatistical approach when you're correlational based approach focusing on risk factors I'm actually a little nervous about that and that'll be part of what I want to talk about but segue for contagious disease it may be fine for cancer but I'm not sure about influenza I mean my mother used to tell me that if I were I unless I wore a head I'd catch a cold okay well a cold is a contagious disease and and my wearing a hat or not was not exactly why I caught a cold but in fact the the independence that required in in some of these correlational stuff would would work on my mother's side the fact that my catching a cold is it's not independent of Charlie's catching it is an important piece that we need to consider so here's the starting with using the KISS principle here's the simplest model disease spread that many of us teach in our classes okay Cara Lee smiling because they just taught it in his people are either uninfected but infect abaut infected or immune to injection they can get it they can recover they die of either disease or background and so here are the parameters that count you put them together and you get transmission recovery and background birth and death and there is in some sense the simplest model disease spread the SIS model and it's easily studied I could explain this I think to to a high school class you know you get one of these two curves depending on the parameters the one on the left has disease dying out the one on the right is disease stabilizing at this point okay and you know very simple analysis leads to the basic reproduction number how many infective does an infective infect in the course of his ear infection or basically what this is is an input versus output ratio and at that number is less than one the disease will die out if that number bigger than one the disease will will spread good week is an endemic level very much like the basic reproduction number and demography how many daughters does a mother have and of course at her fertility so that's the simple model I wanted to study HIV with Jim Coleman and John Jacquet and a number of people on our team and so we would need it to build what did we need to add we needed to add stages of infection we needed to add different levels of sexual activity we were looking back in the in the early 90s of a a male homosexual transmission because that was basically where it was back in those days and any data that we had came from that in particular San Francisco there are still equations a little bit like the others but notice the same structure the basically production number looks the same and so we began to use you know building up simple more a little more complex to begin to understand transmission and and our real goal was was related to that third bullet on modeling it was to understand how contagious HIV is okay as many of you heard me talk about and so basically it sort of a simple process of a mitt of trying to match the model with the empirical data most of those parameters were known the one unknown parameter was how how contagious HIV is when you just get it I'm calling that beta and for different values of beta you got different curves in the model here's what it looked like in San Francisco we were fortunate in San Francisco and that there was hepatitis C samples in labs from that era so we could really go back and look at the data which we couldn't in later most epidemic so if we had looked like this right by the time we got measuring it was far too late but in San Francisco we could capture the beginning and the beginning did not look like this it looked like that so this is a sort of a heuristic about how to use a model to understand the phenomenon our conclusion was HIV is most effective during primary infection in that first month okay I felt pretty pleased about it it was what we had nice stories in The Washington Post camera people but you know photographers I felt like a celebrity for day the New York Times didn't run it and in fact some of my friends strongly disagreed in fact one of them still wrote an article completely blasting with conclusion and saying reasons that he thought it was not correct so the idea and I realized you know what we've done right yeah this is the asymptomatic part so you couldn't this is before symptoms showed that it's most contagious so and and so the you know the basic idea is that the amount of antigen in and in the blood just sort of Peaks during this primary infection and but that's sort of it was a story we told in order to really understand that and really claim it I realized that one needs to go deeper and that's part of the lesson I wanted to talk about the necessity of going deeper to understand so this was a vague not vague but a generalist population macro model too really understand it I think one needed to say what's happening to the individuals what's happening within each individual and what's happening to the virus then once we put all that together I think then the claim becomes much more believable and substantive okay and I just want to describe that and then draw some conclusions so we know this is a a business what was a business US News and Business Report story that were you know had a said pictures a we would we were celebrities for a while though you can see and if you if I let you read the right-hand column which I won't you can see the sewing with some doubt saying you know they showed us a phenomenon but they didn't explain it and why should we you know so the points were showed a pattern but there are things to worry about population you know maybe the population in San Francisco had a very special structure that doesn't exist everywhere that had a role maybe in fact you know the pattern of insertive and receptive sex the pattern of partner change the show social networks one one needed to go and see our next step was to try and and dig deeper and find out what role these played so we did here by the way is note many of you knew Erica when he was here Eric volts school Public Health here is what HIV really looks like this is an Atlanta example these are men and women somewhat high activity somewhat low activity that much different than that model I showed earlier with the compartments this is what we really have to deal with so models are simplifications of reality is to keep it simple but when before you can base policy on a model I think you need to come closer to this so we try to here is by the way uh more so the next bunch of slides are not my own work but work of others studying HIV that has finally come too so I think make the case we made believable so I showed you this curve there's the real curve and in fact primary infection which it can be broken down into very clear periods with very clear physiological components and very clear ways of testing each of these so we we can now actually go in and look at understand at what stage a person with HIV is we also asked about partner change and and you know no model as far as I know of the of the kind we talked about has brought in the central piece of endogenous partner change behavior change I'm sorry behavior change and we know in fact there was huge amount of behavior change in the san francisco community soon as people began to understand the consequences of what was happening and in fact this is a little complicated so i'm not going to spend a lot of time on it but the the different the the the different curves so what we're assuming i should go back to this one that there are there are two kinds of people people of high activity and people of low activity okay just to go a step beyond the other and that they mix and that they change so people move from one level to the other and depending on how long people are in the high activity relatively low activity you get very different dynamics and in fact if there's no change the primary infection has very little extra role it's only when the changes are pretty the amount of time they spend in the high plays a big role the the amount of intense sexual activity relative the amount of lower sexual activity plays a big role in the spread of the disease that the simple model is masking and yellow and also it plays a big role in how much transmission comes from that first month period okay so it is substantive can be as much as 60 70 percent but it does depend on the behave the network and the patterns of the individuals in the community it's another this is an another example of a lump of me in and this is trying to focus on again the differences between transmission from primary infection which here is called acute infection and transmission from later infectivity which in this case is called chronic infection and where people are you know in this fourth case here look go back these are acute infection it plays a much bigger role and there's much more transmission so again when I'm just trying to say without explaining this is that the the who mixes with whom and and and the the relative levels of sexual activity play a big role and before you can go make claims about policy one needs to understand the effects of these and and now in fact the story is really strong you can actually take the virus from a person with HIV and tell how long that person's been infected by looking at you know different genetic ID clusters okay and in some cases understand who they got it from and when they got it though and you know finally 15 years after our work in in the New England Journal of Medicine the the statement was made primary infection is important and in fact this is our group here we were among the first to realize that and but there are some people saying it's close to 70 to 80 percent of transmission so the the [Music] so I want to say is that the it's good to begin with a model that helped understand patterns but before you can act on them you need to understand mechanisms that's sort of the bottom line I want to say another example I mean I I think economics and it's sort of weird to teach a subject I don't believe in but many of you have taken econ classes and you know here's how it works you've got these phenomena you assume people have preferences they have a budget line the rational consumer chooses the best point on their budget line and you know you you get the textbook model of consumer choice and production okay and on the last chapter you get the ultimate theorem that come from this model markets always work okay and so you know open up any econ book and you'll see there again I think this is over belief in a simple model I mean you could say okay tell me the assumptions that make this work and among them are things like perfect perfectly rational consumers I'm exaggerating a little bit but not a lot some of the work especially in the complex systems group but also in the School of Public Health and biology that really helped I think cases where models really shed light on beyond the usual sort of empirical work Kristin Hass Miller licks thesis that said that showed that if you build a model that of smoking and include smoking in the model of the spread of tuberculosis you find that smoking causes two to three times more tuberculosis related the spread of two or three times more tuberculosis than it then the statistical models would say because here all the indirect effects are playing a role cacciucco leaves now Duke sort of put together the the epidemiology of influenza with the genetics and got much better prediction and an understanding of influenza outbreaks by putting together the macro and the micro pieces of the model so sort of conclude mushiya models I think of beginning with the heuristic one may be doing a statistical one to understand how pieces might fit together but then really building it with the compartments and the arrows and understanding the true links and maybe quantifying another way of classifying models are the one I first started which was a population macro model but I think until we understood how individuals work and the the role of individuals and what was happening to them that was an important component and then finally building in the genetic and and cellular structure what are the mechanisms we see it happening why is it happening so I've really come to feel strongly that understanding mechanisms what one can't believe it phenomenon without having a good understanding of the mechanism very much like Gil's question at the end of the first talk and and some examples that concern me and these are things I haven't thought about deeply but I'd love to have a discussion especially individual but even now I heard a talk I'm a member of the National Academy math board and and the the research head of the FDA came and talked about drug pest and her clear statement was we are we are not we are not allowed to use mechanistic models we are only allowed to use statistical randomized clinical trials and correlation to look at the effectiveness of a drug because quote it's the only method at its Assumption tree whoa it's based medicine who couldn't believe who cranks Temujin sounds great right basically evidence-based medicine is about using randomized clinical trials as the Holy Grail and thinking of this as cause right when I heard her talk again another National Academy talk and I sort of challenged him he said speaker to know this is causal it's not correlational it's causal and about that so I mean some examples to think about our breast cancer the the random critic RCTs say women should not actually women under 50 should not have regular mammograms that's a pretty strong me that there is no decrease in cancer death that's a long stream and yet though a group of ten ten groups of modelers went and looked more carefully built in all the assumptions that about how people act and interact and came up with in conclude the opposite conclusion and and you know the same beginning to for her prostate cancer and the kinds of tests that you know and and finally the big concern we are in the world of big data you know isn't it exciting and yet a lot of big data is just using sort of the holy grail of correlational tests to look for patterns without understanding mechanisms I do think those are both an important piece so the you know I think we start with simple models the the correlational or the macro models but it's crucial to understand first of all list the assumptions behind them and secondly begin to understand the mechanisms or as Indiana Jones said beware of searches for the Holy Grail thank you the seminar normally ends at 4:30 but today we go until 5:00 if you could request our speakers to come up to the seats in front will now open up the room for discussions please raise your hand if you have any questions we'll come to you with mics and we can get started I have the mic I have the mic I have several questions but I have a question for the mod module person is is it how do you deal with context in them and defining modules I'm a geneticist and chromosome is a module and the chromosomes organize each organized in transcription and different modular relationships I didn't about context here I think that's a major concern about using gene networks to study the organization of cells in the sense of what when we typically get a gene Network it's based on studying changes in expression level at these different genes in which these causal interactions are inferred between the genes and then the network is static right it doesn't depend on what kind of input or output is coming into the cell the structure stays the same and then the hope is using that static representation of the causal structure of the cell you can find these decomposable subunits and it may entirely turn out that the structure of the network is highly contact sensitive in which case what's what's the module under one set of conditions may not be a module under a set of others so I think that's one of the primary assumptions of using to trying to discover the organization of gene networks and using modules as an approach I have a question for a kernel that I've asked him before and I'm wondering where we stand on this now Karl is is that if you have the macro micro on the Nano level what are your thoughts about modeling are we going to have commonalities across those levels in the model or are we going to have a series of models with a meta model that's going to bring those models together where we stand on that right now well I mean one one of the beauties of models is I think we've discussed is that there are incredible similarities and cross different levels Denyce Kirchner's work and as ue work at showing at the at the gin at the cellular level and the population level the scaling things scale up very naturally so I actually I think answers both I don't know that there's a general but then the models that I know and love there's a rather beautiful scaling of the phenomena at the different levels Charlie you read okay yeah sort of Bob Laughlin who's a physicist who after his first Nobel Prize he was one of the early proponents of using the word emergence you know and in his example or his definition of emergence was by example he held out a pen and he said you know name some properties of this object well one of which is very easy to see rigidity you know it it holds its shape when it's subject to forces and so on and he said now now tell me how you could predict that from the properties of the interactions of quarks and gluons and so on right and of course the question is answers itself that so so emergence is is this property that doesn't even exist the concept of hardness or stiffness or mechanical properties doesn't exist at the micro level yet it is something that that appears very naturally and obviously at the macro level now to what extent sort of a question for all of you but for Carl in particular to what extent do I need a model in order to recognize recognize that emergent property and maybe you know for George for example what is you know is consciousness as a as the interaction of these pieces something that is emergent in a sense that I could not have or you know nobody could have predicted it based on understanding the physiology of the brain and the neuroscience and the connections of the brain or in a cell could anyone predict that a cell would look like a function like it does based on understanding the motifs and they the systems biology below it so I'm trying to get back to the emergence if I may so I alright I think you've captured your pen sort of captures it may be a little too grossly oh no both mobile so for me emergence is much more quiet client than and maybe depend example its what assumptions at the micro level what behavior what structure at the micro level or the nano level yield particular patterns at the macro level right that's there's nothing wrong with that but but you know understanding if we see a society of you know we see individuals with certain behaviors or cells with certain behaviors what can we expect of the of the macro object I mean I think when it comes to the brain and not even talking about consciousness but I think it's critical to have a systems neurosciences and that would be the equivalent in the neurosciences thinking about an individual neuron neurophysiological II versus a systems level approach and if you think about an example that would apply to consciousness or anesthesia they think about a gabaergic neuron okay so gaba is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain so you might think just thinking from the perspective of that neuron or two neurons that if i potentiated the effect of data you get a depression the school system you put that into a systems neuroscience context that GABAergic potentiate potentiation might actually be inhibiting an inhibitor and now you've got excitation or disinhibition or you've got a certain compartment let's say for example on the pontine reticular formation in the brainstem where when you increase GABA levels you actually have more arousal so I think from that perspective in very concrete terms really do need to take assistance man a science approach to understand behavioral Carl um for HIV in fact if 'ti did the macro-level model give the right answer even without taking into account contact net networks and if so why well it gave the right answer because that's what was there at the macro level right I mean in fact a large amount of transmission was occurring by people who had just would just continuity infection and we found that at the macro level but the question I wanted to ask was what's the mechanism that pushes that and I think until we understood that we were a little just you know sort of phenomenon oriented and not really understanding what we wanted to understand hi I guess this is also a general question to all three of you maybe so I I work with people who do the straightforward correlational stuff so I'm from the bio stats department and we study disease and I was and it's sort of it's nice to think about diseases and emergent thing so we we study diabetes which is really complicated thing lots of different physiological things happening and they all lead to something that's easily identifiable in terms of a diagnosis but it's hard to make a mathematical or a statistical model for it so so we've been talking about merchants and if we talk about diseases as emergent things how do we use all of these concepts that you talked about in order to move ahead from this simple correlational stuff - they're doing something that that makes use of emergency to the city well one thing I would I would say if I can shift your question to talking about the behavior of cells oftentimes when modelers build your mathematical simulations of chemotaxis how the cell moves up the gradient over time they break it down into two simple stages rather the cell is tumbling or it's moving forward and imagine if biologists never went back and actually paid very careful attention to whether that was an accurate description of how the cells moved and it may be that in fact I think there has been some users to this effect that the if you track how the cell is moving over time it's more sophisticated than just random reorientation and then forward motion and I think the point there is to take the emergent phenomenon of the cells overall behavior as a subject for description and phenomenological understanding as a corrective to assumptions that you know too problematic assumptions in the modeling process so in that sense to treat something like diabetes as an emergent phenomenon course study is to say well let's not ignore environment let's actually go out and pay attention to what people are doing in general and come up with a detailed careful understanding of all the factors that might be relevant to that people think might make a difference and that will help us understand whether our more reductive or more idealized models are really capturing the underlying process and I think actually a in slight defensive correlation you brought up an important point which is diagnosis I mean I don't want I don't think we should knock careful correlation because I can tell you in a mestizo ology we've been using these drugs since 1846 we do not know how they work we did not I know how to use them and actually it is the best at this these are the best drugs in medicine I don't know if anybody's ever told you that they work 100% of the time they are infallible they've never been a single case report of somebody not being able to be invested us you don't know how they work at a mechanistic level but if but if I had a very clear correlate a neural correlate something I could that would actually be a major advance for us and so I just mean I know we're talking about emergence but the correlation is not always easy either and can actually be incredibly useful as you pointed out in a diagnostic sense but would be great to understand the mechanism I'm really we're working on it yes yes I have a couple questions the first one is is so you were talking about modeling HIV infection across populations let's say you were able to do this perfectly you had a perfect model for measuring this what would you do with it so that's that's a question about what kind of policy one might so it'd be good to understand first of all we really had a good model we could think about next a vaccination strategy that might help that article I showed you from US News and World Report was about musings about given our results what kind of vaccination strategies might work best a model that a paper just published by colleague carlos castillo chavez was talking about ebola and the importance and and and and showing how early detection can make a big difference in the spread of ebola that tells you you should be focusing on on mechanisms whether they be medicine or engineering for figuring out you know quick tests of early disease so that you know twenty years ago the the only way to you know there were rather course blood tests that that could determine whether or not one had HIV and the blood tests wouldn't kick in until in fact after primary infection so that you didn't know whether or not by the time you knew you were hiv-positive you were beyond a highly infectious period but the results would tell you we need to get and we did get much more accurate early detectors [Music] and i had another heart o this school so this kind of goes along with the consciousness so have you ever used like people in comas as a control you see these kind of saying pathways lighting up with the MRI scans or they completely dark no there's been a lot of work trying to relate these there's unconscious States from physiologic pharmacologic or pathologic ideologies physiologically sleep from the collage of things like general anesthesia and pathologic cases of traumatic brain injury it's it's interesting i mean there are a lot of similarities across these different states and i showed you some for example in terms of frontal parietal deactivation and I think those similarities are building now the question is if they're all these similar neural correlates how come I can wake up from sleep like this and general anesthesia like this in coma maybe never so I think those are some of the emerging challenges could I ask a question actually a voter fellow not of you yes it's I don't know you I don't know easy answer but uh our fellow panelists here so you know we're active in a lab and we're dealing with these questions we don't ever explicitly discuss whether we're functioning or hypothesizing or working in a reductionist mode versus something more along along the lines of you know emergent to this thinking do you think that you know everyday working stiffs scientists like us would actually benefit from having a more thoughtful approach thoughtful meta scientific approach to what we're actually doing in the lab well professionally something McLaughlin yes but I think maybe a level at which that kind of thinking becomes very important is at the level of high level or is that decisions made on whole funding portfolios for the National Science Foundation of the NIH right and you can think of the billions of dollars that were spent on the human genome project and all kinds of claims went along with how having whole genomes would help us explain that new types of development and different organisms and there were a number of criticisms at the time that no just having the DNA isn't going to be enough but those often get overridden in a sense of the technology is driving us forward this has a lot of promise there are reasonable arguments for it and I think a higher higher level of awareness of what these different strategies are and their history and how they've succeeded or failed would for example contribute to the possibility of a more balanced portfolio in a sense of why keep funding research on organismal biology or in developmental biology when we might have this great hope for omics and the study of molecular outcomes for different interventions well because we found that in the past things are much more complicated than any particular set of molecular properties has led us to understand and I think that can work on a lab level too but perhaps most strongly when we consider why it is that each of these different strategies to understanding the same phenomena are worth keeping around my response might be related to the question in the back and and you know I I'm not I understand that the drugs you use have shown to be a hundred percent effective over a long period of time but if I'm looking at the at a new drug and trying to evaluate its effectiveness and if the things I should worry about I actually think that a correlational proof should have a lot of caveats and and you know discussion of what the assumptions and what what errors might occur something I'm may happen but I don't quite see it so I would it's a matter of how cautious I would be about the practical applications of the discovery I think we'll make this our last three to the you and Gail and then there's somebody right over here I think you'd one yeah we hear you at five all the Mike there we are okay so I should have insisted that I ask my question I was going to ask so in science you do see these kinds of different sides of the coins such as you know what what Carl and Beckett have shown us you know the benefits and and problems with both reductionist and more emergent thinking and we see similar things with for instance applied in basic research and we try to strike a balance with some of these things you know where you want to fund both of them because they kind of feed each other do you think that there is some kind of balance that we should be striving or between emergence and reduction and if so do you think it's a nonsensical question to ask what what kinds of qualities that balance might have and that's kind of for everybody but I think that perhaps Beckett thinking about this kind of stuff might have something to say yeah I think that's a great question and I think it's hard to say what that balance would be outside of the context of a particular case I mean I think one one way to look at it would be bring it back to the level of a particular research program in a lab would be to think ahead like let's say that I'm hoping to find consciousness localized in a particular part of the brain right and so that I think they integrated hypothesis is wrong what am I going to need to have around if I turn out to be if that hypothesis turns out to be false right I don't want all the work that I've done based on that precept which is presupposition to then just be thrown out and never cared about again I'd like to have also contributed to our understanding of the anatomy of the physiology of this part of the brain and then maybe I can plan to move forward to study how it interacts with other parts of the brain even if it turns out to not be definitional for consciousness in every possible condition maybe it's really important under some but not under other is that sort of thing so the kind of balance that one could pursue there is to think in that methodological or reflective frame about what the plan is for the next ten years how it can go one way or the other and then what do you need to have around in order to keep pursuing the research under the different scenarios so I hope I don't sound like sour grape but I do think 99% of NIH funding is for the reductionist and and there is not a balance that it's also going to ask or suggest that you know we we can't it probably wouldn't work if every lab is trying to be both reductionist and I mean you know we would need this functional specialization and overall integration of these of these different approaches to be at that I would imagine so the NIH has put a big spotlight on neurosciences brain project latest brain project and the theme is connectivity I think it's a very physical sense of connectivity and the kind of emergent properties you showed with the different kinds of loops and different kinds of underlying pathways that have so far not really revealed complex behaviors will be a challenge to see if there's some way of stimulating that kind of broader deeper understanding from this new kind of approach and I think when I comment on that or not well I think it's great that you bring up the many dimensions of what the term connectivity means and just you know in a nutshell you can think about at least four times one would be structural connectivity so you have certain neurons connecting with other neurons in the brain you could also talk about functional connectivity which was really more a statistical covariation or the correlational aspect that we're talking about you could talk about directed connectivity which introduces a dimension of time and thinking about what is proceeding what is following and then also effective connectivity which tries to elucidate more causal influences so how these all interrelate and how they're measured I think are an important questions but I think understanding the the structural framework or the highways on which the cars are driving so to speak is the bigger focus right now so I know it's late um before I turn the microphone back to Shwetha and to thank our speakers I want to thank them because this was a very interesting idea one of our thoughtful affiliate members of this Center for computational medicine bioinformatics Tomas Verner in Europe his business multiple times send us a idea proposal we should get together our students and our faculty and our staff and our friends and have a week-long deep dive on some compelling topic that would be out of the box from our usual discussions so our faculty and especially our enterprising students decided maybe we should start with now in a hats and see how it goes so I think you've done a wonderful job and very stimulating out of the idea of thinking about things beyond what we do every single day and capturing and sort of coaching information or potentially coaching information for a broader sample of what's going on is part of the purpose of this weekly seminar I hope it stimulates you to come every week and we'll do this periodically so congratulations both of you on a successful experiment as I see it but but Gil you're your challenge I like the second part this this is a good start having 15-20 minutes to the challenge but I love the follow-up and you know people are interested in following up some of this I'm game and I hope with your help to have that whole day of sitting in and there was a question here that almost didn't get asked one possible takeaway of this is that we might need a science of individuality both to explain consciousness and mechanisms of infection transmission statistics as a discipline doesn't seem to be particularly well-suited to understand the science of individuality what sort of a discipline might we need to really understand the science of individuality first before we apply the statistics there's a net what psychology trying to do in some ways I would like to thank the center of complex systems that that I helped start and and and Charlie here is going to run is very much emergences sort of the banner that we love to pull up every day connecting the individuals of the I'd like to thank us because or participating in our experiment and skill called it please join me also thank you for joining us we weren't sure how it would turn out so good to see so many of you n thanks for staying back so late and finally I'd like to thank Margot Brian and Gil for lots of input and for helping us conceptualize this whole project so thanks
