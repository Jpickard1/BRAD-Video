um great well uh can everyone hear me okay okay um and thank you Inda for inviting me uh it's I was I was saying earlier I haven't been back to an arbor I grew up here but I haven't been back in about 10 years uh so it's really cool to come back and kind of see you know some things are familiar some things not so familiar but uh you know to kind of visit what I thought of his home for the long a very long time so that's very cool um and I'm also going to tell you today about uh things that we've been working on in my lab uh at sulk um uh our lab is really interested as Inda said in ter 3D genome structure and sort of how our genome is organized in space and I'm going to kind of present some data that we've been uh working on uh really thinking about how our our studies of 3D genome structure I think are are uh helping us to think about sort of the impact of particular classes of sequence variant and this would be both uh a structural variance as well as a sematic germline single nucleotide polymorphis um so okay so I guess I'm just going to start giving you kind of a brief outline of what I'm actually going to talk about today so for the first part I'm going to give a little bit of intro uh to generally introduce why we're interested in how your genome PS up in space uh and some introduce some of the tools that we use and some of the general principles we observe um I'm also going to uh uh talk a little bit about um in in the first part a story about what happens to a particular feature of genome organization we call topological domains uh these are also called topologically associating domains or tads uh and so what we can see that uh basically it happens to these in the context of structural variation in cancer genomes uh and the uh for the second part of the talk I'm actually going to talk about some new method development we've been working on uh trying to do basically single cell uh profiling using both uh 3D genome structure as well as d methylation uh and trying to use this in complex tissues with really kind of the goal of this uh at least one potential long-term goal to try to understand variants that might be associated with particular human diseases uh so yeah so what are we talking about in terms of 3D genome organization so we have uh you know some three billion base pairs in a Hao copy of the human genome uh these all have to be compacted down within the nucleus and I think most people are sort of uh typically thinking about DNA in sort of a linear fashion as sort of a sequence of nucleic acids that we be able to layer some sort of feature information on top of right so we can annotate genes or regulatory sequences um and you know I I would say this is kind of the conventional way that people think about sort of DNA right uh but we actually know that this is really actually folded up in threedimensional space inside of cells uh so that the different genes and Regulatory sequences come in close contact and that this can really impact sort of genome function um and uh so this is kind of a major you know question that we're interested in uh and so one kind of just as an example one reason why one might be interested in 3D genome organization uh is uh sort of given in sort of a toy example here which is that um as a field the field of genomics we've actually gotten very good at mapping regulatory sequences in the genome using things like chipseek attack seek whatnot and if you do this for your favorite transcription factor in your favorite sample you'll inevitably come to a situation that looks like this where you find some enhancer that sits here and maybe there's two genes nearby and sort of from the you know one-dimensional sort of a priority sequence here you don't know what this enhancers doing you don't know if it regulates Gene a or Gene B um but we also know that the way that enhancers work or at least the sort of dominant model for how they work is that they're brought in close spatial proximity with the genes that they regulate and this allows proteins that bind to the enhancer to interact with proteins that Bine at the promoter uh and this facilitates transcription and so in this sense we can begin to say maybe map which enhancers are in proximity with which genes to get better ideas of what are the Target genes of regulatory sequences and so you can think about this problem in a slightly different way which is that if you then say layer some sort of genetic information on top of this say you know there's a polymorphism that sits within this enhancer and perhaps we know this polymorphism may be associated with a particular trait or a human disease uh this actually kind of reformulates this problem slightly which is to say that now the question is if this enhancer targets Gene a or Gene B this allows you to make insights in terms of sort of the molecular pathogenesis of this variant in other words saying uh does does this if this enhancer targets Gene a you can put that in one particular pathway or another uh and this gives you insights in terms of sort of the disease biology as well as you know potential sort of therapeutic personalized medicine approaches that might be able amendable for treatment um the other aspect in which I think we're thinking about this problem a lot is in cancer genomes and then also in some cases in The Germ line you can have mutations that will basically break a chromosome and Stitch it back together with a new partner right so we would call this a structural variant and in this case the problem again changes to say well if this does this enhancer now regulate this Gene that's now in a novel context right and this is particularly important say if this Gene is an enag Gene now it becomes a question of if this is really regulating this Gene this might be part of what's driving anagenesis um so in terms of the tools we actually use to kind of map out these structures so the dominant tool that we use in the lab is uh sort of molecular biology based AET called high SE uh this was originally developed by y Decker and AOS Liber Aiden and um Eric Lander as well and the idea is that you take a population of cells and you fix them with her Malahide such that if you had an enhancer and promoter that have been brought close together in spatial uh 3D space these will actually become uh cently linked to each other because the crosses you then digest ends of DNA with the Restriction enzyme uh and then you can fill these in with nucleotides one of which is linked to a biotin vo you can liate these ends together and this preferentially occurs between things that were originally enclosed threedimensional space this generates a contiguous piece of DNA that doesn't exist naturally anywhere in the genome and is now conveniently marked with biot uh we can then purify DNA and isolate these ligated fragments using a strip out of a coded bead and then subject this to high throughput PA and DNA sequence and this gives you a picture of basically all the Poss interactions that might be occurring in a PO population of cell at any one time uh and in terms of how we actually look at the data um I'm sure there are people here are very familiar with this but just in case there are not uh what we're really doing is we're basically taking these reads and we're aligning to the genome and we're asking how different regions uh contact each other and the way this really looks is we start by taking the one-dimensional sequence and we break it up into bins and these can be of sort of arbitrary size it depends on the resolution that you're looking at uh for low resolution data these might be a million base pairs in size for high resolution data these would be about a kilobase in size um and uh oh hello yeah right uh and um uh what we essentially doing is mapping the reads that go between bins right so in this case there are uh five reads between this bin on the right and this one on the left or and the one in the middle and we can assign that particular color and then we can say there's three between these two leftand bins we assign that a color we say there's one between these two outside bins we assign that a color and this way we build a colorcoded map of how these different regions of genomes were contacting each other such that some of the real data looks like this this is from this phc1 Gene Locus so we could say how does maybe this promote a proximal region interact with this Upstream enhancer by finding where the two intersect off the diagonal and looking at what signals there so in this case this kind of pink signal suggests these interact with thum level of frequency whereas white would suggests they interact infrequently if at all um and so we've been doing these assays now for several years uh and one of the features that we were really able to identify now many years ago is what we call topological domains we also called topologically associating domains or tads uh and really the way that we identify these is we just start by looking at the data uh and so this is highy data from neural progenitors over about an eight million base pair stretch of the genome I think one of the things that you can almost immediately appreciate is there are these little triangles that pop up right so triangle triangle triangle triangle Etc and one of the things that we thought was interesting about this is if you think about what a triangle would mean in this kind of data uh basically this stretch forming a triangle is a sequence that interacts a lot with itself uh this stretch is a triangle is a stretch that interacts a lot with itself but the relative lack of signal going between them suggests that they're at least relatively spatially isolated from and so we can uh kind of represent this in cartoon form and again this is really just a sort of a cartoonish model to conceptualize this uh is something like this where one cluster might correspond to one triangle here a second one corresponds to this triangle um the other thing that we're able to see that I think is actually pretty remarkable is when we were able to profile these kind of uh patterns across different cell types we're actually able to see that the position of where these kind of domains were occurring The genome is actually very stable across what are are fairly diverse cell types um so uh we basically think that these probably are forming some fundamental unit of how your genome is being organized um and this slide is really to summ summarize work that's been done by many Labs at this point over now many years uh which is to say what what do the what do we think these really do uh the idea is these are maybe 200 kilobases to two megabases size uh they seem to form as a result of kind of an interplay between uh this transcription Factor called ctcf and a complex called cohesion uh the dominant model uh I would say in the field right now is this model called Loop Extrusion uh which is that these are facilitated by basically DNA looping events um and in terms of function I think the most clearly uh described function that we have at this point has to do with these regulating enhancer promoter commun and so some some kind of evidence to support this is uh particular cases where we know a particular enhancer regulates a specific Gene Say by genetic evidence or whatnot uh these uh are almost always occurring within the same topological domain uh there's there is a T Trend Trend towards gene expression being correlated within tads across different tissue types uh if you take reporter constructs that basically have minimal promoters and you insert them in the genome they'll start picking up expression patterns of nearby enhancers but only those that are within the same domain uh and from I think really seminal work from Stefan ml's group they were actually show that structural variants that would alter the Tad boundaries would lead to altered enhancer promoter communication and altered gene expression and uh these human developmental phenotypes uh and as last point was really something that I thought was super cool when we were starting my group at sulk uh which is if you kind of compare some of the things I've told you right so structural variants would be things like these inversions deletions insertions or translocations where you're taking a chromosome you're breaking it apart and you're stitching it back together if you kind of contrast this with this really stable pattern in terms of where we were seeing these domains simly these would have to have a pretty big effect in terms of how your Gene was being organized and we wanted to get really a better idea of how this would be occurring and what the consequences are of these kind of events on 3D genome structure uh and so I would say also this is not necessarily like a purely academic problem uh in that structural variation is actually extremely common in human cancers so this is data from a cohort of 500 and something breast cancer patients where the median tumor has about 85 rearrangements that's a very kind of Rich landscape to alter these sort of 3D genome structures uh and we know that rearrangements that basically alter enhancer promoter communication are basically the causal defining genetic lesions that contribute to a variety of different human malignancies uh this is probably best described within hematopoetic uh uh cancers so U things like these t- cell leukemias with these deletions near chal one uh immunoglobuline rearrangements near Mick in the particular classes of lymphomas uh and there's additional cases of this that are basically being identified uh all the time now um and so we thought that this was particularly interesting and uh uh basically wanted to kind of dive into this a little bit more to say can we do this in more systematic ways of identifying tabs that are rearranged in cancer and understanding the consequences a little bit better uh so I'm going to kind of go through this this little bit very quickly because I know that fun UA came like a year ago and talked a little bit about some of this uh and so we had uh uh collaborated with fun uh to actually try to use high dat to find rearrangements uh the basic way that this works is if you take High SE data this is from basically normal non-rearranged partions of the genome where this is interactions within in this case chromosome one oras these are interactions between chromosome one and two and we compare that with data from regions of the genome where we know there's something like a translocation you see these sort of really dramatic alterations in uh signal right so this this kind of diffuse hazy pattern you see between two non-rearranged chromosomes is very strongly altered at this specific point and the Very uh kind of dramatic transition in contact frequency right at the break point of where we know this translocation occurs and so we uh teong we actually developed some computational tools to go in and find this kind of signature and identify regions of the genome where this occurs uh and so subsequently we've uh then were able to use that data to then kind of ask some uh sort of basic questions about what's happening when we find these rearrangements so uh this is basically an example case where we find a translocation in this case between chromosome 9 and 18 uh and where we think this is basically the highy data within the region chromosome 18 this is the high data within chromosome 9 and because we have the highy and other data like bionano or H sequencing we could see that these were really actually fused together now into a new translocated Al and then we can overlay highy data that crosses the break point and you can see them form this kind of nice little triangle here right so we think this is basically this translocation is to the formation of a new domain um we've been able to do this a little bit more systematically to ask is this kind of a general pattern and I think the answer is yes uh so basically using a couple different approaches both in the paper we published with fun as well as in a uh something that's been uh a collaboration with Andy Andy futri Lab at MD Anderson um what we we think the general trend is is kind of illustrated by this kind of diagram here is that when you get a structural variant uh what you're basically doing is taking the new nearest Tad boundaries and stitching them together to form a new domain across the break point and that seems to be the kind of general rule that we're observing in the data yeah I mean the the there there's some way that these have been called neot tads or Fusion tads uh but yeah so it's it's basically a novel novel Tad novel regulatory environment you would say so um so from the standpoint of like a pure annity like just gaining one additional copy um I don't I don't honestly know I've I've seen some data from like down syndrome that it doesn't seem to have a huge effect of just gaining one additional copy um but in this case this is not to gain potential of copy it's it's also a jux toos so I think what's driving this is primarily the the novel jux toos of genetic sequences Cas I think it's I mean it's an interesting question like if you stuff like a genome doubling event happens all the time in cancer that's twice as many chromosomes seeming that would do something but I don't have a particularly good answer for that um yeah so basically we were able to see these kind of patterns and uh what we thought this was interesting but we had a few questions that we wanted to address so one is being able to identify these we said well are there regions that we can find where there's recurrent alterations to pads in the genome in cancer genomes and two um you know in the event that these were forming is is there anything in particular that's actually required for them to uh form or to uh contribute to sort of enogen or uh uh gene expression changes or Gene disregulation um and so the way that we basically have tried to go about doing this is by profiling sort of many different cell types at this point so we've uh either generated or analyzed High SE data and now from 92 different cancer cell uh samples so this is a mixture of both patient cell line or patient samples as well as cancer cell lines that we have in the lab uh about a third of this is data that's already publicly available so we just download that reanalyze it and the rest stuff that we've generated um and we can then take these tools that we developed for finding structural variants and apply that in this context and so this is actually an example of one that we find in a a breast cancer patient sample uh and so our tool we can basically pull this out and say Here's a translocation and then we can zoom in and identify the break point in pretty high resolution um and so we've basically taken this tool and we've applied this um to these samples we've also included a set of like known rearrangements so tumors that have kind of disease defining translocations so these are ones from these Mixel leukemia tumors where they all have a mixin leukemia or mt2a translocation uh and that's to different partner regions and so in this case it's aff1 AF afn and in this case mllt3 and so uh we can basically find these kind of known events in all cases so we actually think that it's pretty sensitive to find these large scale structural changes um so now we can basically apply this across this whole system and say where do we find Chang uh and so this is basically kind of a Manhattan plot style uh pileup of all the regions that we defined uh altered Tad structure as a result of the structural variance U and we develop a fairly simple statistical model to account for the size of the Tad as well as the overall frequency to say are there sites that we can find that are being recurrently affected uh and the answer is yes there's actually 12 different regions that we find in our data that show evidence of recurrent Tad structural alterations uh and at least some of the top hits are sort of your classic you know anene low site that we can see so the most frequently arranged site is Mick uh we can see frequent events at tomam race and cyclin V1 uh some of the other ones that I don't have labeled here it's partly because there might be many genes or multiple an the locus we don't necess know there's one target or multiple um well I'll we'll get to it yeah so uh so we thought this was cool but I think you know one one issue right is we want to be able to say can you see this in independent data set right so we have a lot of sell line data and you could argue maybe there's some weird cell line artifacts uh and so what we've been doing is looking in data that's been generated through this International cancer genome Consortium and so this is whole genome sequencing data um uh they actually have this now from like 2,000 patients where they have matched tumor and geraline whole genome sequencing and they have fairly high quality uniform uh structural variant call sets um and so if we perform kind of a similar analysis in this case over 3,000 tabs across this whole data set um we can see the the sites that we identified in our high SE data in red and so you can see that some of these are still very highly rearranged icgc data whereas uh a few of them are really not particularly enriched and maybe kind of false positives in our data um and I should also say the way that we do this right we don't have high SE data from Le 2,000 people so we're using kind of a crude proxy for a rearrangement between tads by basically saying if you have a structural variant where one Breakin maps in one domain in the other breake maps and the other we're sort of assuming this has to alter the Tad structure somehow so we're basically calling these Cod inter Tad rearrangement and this is this is the basically the frequency of inter Tad rearrangements by by Locus um and again you can actually see that Mick is the most frequently affected site again in the genome cure and because of this we wanted to focus a little bit more on Mick and try to say what's going on here and what we what might be interesting uh we could see that uh actually this these Mick inter Tad rearrangements in this data were actually occurring in a wide variety of different tumor types uh so Mick rearrangements in terms terms of these uh you know regulatory Fusion alterations are actually very well known to occur in uh lymphoma samples but we're seeing these in really a wide variety of tumor so the the most frequently rearranged uh subset is uh these um uh blinking on the word uh endometrial cancers so endometrial cancer ovarian gastric ovarian this is a lymphoma subset esophageal breast cancer lung cancer so we see these really all over the place in all the different tumor types that are in there there's some that are at lower frequency and it's not totally clear what that is but uh we're really seeing these all over the place um and we can actually see the same thing if we look in our high data which is this is some of the fusion events that we find at the mick Locus uh and so we can find here's Mick and then you get these novel uh signals that form in this case with what's chromosome 2 and this is in a breast cancer cell line another breast cancer get contacts there pancreatic cancer sample you see some novel contacts here and this is in a lymphoma where these events are actually known to occur but you can also see these kind of Novel contacts here um and uh so the other thing that's cool about looking in the icgc data is they have RNA seek data for uh not all of the 2000 something patients but a lot uh and so we can ask do these also show elevated Mick expression and so what we can see is looking across all tumor types we do see that there's an elevated expression in of Mick in tumors that have these kind of inter Tad rearrangements at the mix domain compared to ones that don't uh and we can see that this also occurs within specific subtypes again liant lymphoma is a subtype where this is known to occur but we can also see this in other subtypes like breast cancer uh and so Mick is actually you know a very well-known anene it's known to be Amplified in many different kinds of cancers but we don't actually think that this is a product of copy number changes and we can we think that we we can see this because if you filter this pan cancer data for tumors that lack any kind of high level copy number change you still see that the ones that have inter tab rearrangements show expression if we're even more strict and we say we we we restrict to only having tumors that show no copy number change at all at the M Locus we can still see that these tumors that have inter Tad rearrangement elevated necessarily strictly due to copy number changes I think at least a reasonable component of this effect is actually being due to altering sort of the regulatory architecture of the gene um so the other thing that we looked at is uh sort of partner regions and this is actually where it gets to be a little bit confusing at least initially so in in lymphomas it's very clear there's Mick and there's IG and they form a partner and that is basically a defined event and you can genetically look for that and that tells you something immediately about the patient uh if we ask in these pan cancer data is there recurrent Partners the answer is basically no uh you can see there's maybe some chromosomes where there might be a slight enrichment on a particular arm but for the most part these go everywhere right and I think coupling that with the fact that in the expression data you know there's still a fairly strong overlap between the non-rearranged and the rearranged tumors we thought that this was kind of interesting to say well given that you see this heterogeneity of Partners uh as well as this sort of uh you know enriched but not an absolute difference in expression one question was well how do we tell a tumor that's actually being driven by a a regulatory rearrangement we can't really do it by saying well if it has X partner it is by definition activating M expression and we can't necessarily assume that if it has just any rearrangement that it has elevated expression and so we wanted to try to address this and the way that we've gone about trying to do this is actually by doing a crisper C9 genome Engineering in particular cell lines uh and so we've been doing this in neuroast cell lines uh basically trying to engineer novel translocations uh the way that this works is we the part of the reason why we chose neuroblastoma is uh they have this really interesting uh phenomenon where there are some neuroblastoma tumors that have high level enic amplifications and express high levels of enic and there are some neuroblastomas that have rearrangements at cic and express high levels of cic uh and when I say Mick in these cases I'm I'm talking about the cic gene not the enm Gene and so we had data where we could say this is a celline that expresses very high levels of semic and we have a translocation here on chromosome 8 at the M Locus whereas this is a a cell line that doesn't Express much uh cic at all and has no rearrangements at the semic locus and so it's basically kind of a blank slate and so we said let's take one of these cell lines that doesn't Express semic and let's try to just screw up the locus and see what kind of expression changes we can make and if we can make any sense of the consequence and this is the RNA seek data for these two cells uh so what we've been doing is we basically take to guide rnas we label them with different plasmas we transfect them into cells plate them as single cells and grow up colonies and then we can actually Screen through the colonies it's actually fairly easy to do the screening because you're looking for a rearrangement just by PCR if it's there there's a band if there's not there's nothing it's inefficient but it's it's an easy screen to do uh and we can then uh do say PCR across the P saying or sequencing across the PCR breakpoint to confirm the rearrangement and we can also do things like uh ch on painting to actually show that they the engineered cell lines have these translocations in this case comone eight and seven um so the other thing that I should say is uh oh yeah we can also confirm that these events we can see rearrangements by high SE as well so these are four different clones where we uh engineered rearrangements to the same Locus and in each of these cases you see these novel contacts Crossing The Brak Point um the other thing I should say is we actually specifically were sort of aiming to Target regions where we thought they were super enhancers and the reason for this uh and I guess to give a quick background super enhancers the idea is there are a class of regulatory sequences that are basically just the strongest enhancers in the they tend to have a sort of exponentially higher uh activity than sort of a a typical enhancer uh and they were you know described by Rick young as well as I think some others historically um as basically these large clustered enhancer regions you know and there's some pretty clear data that these are generally Associated or found near critical lineage developmental uh regulatory je uh and what we could actually see is in our high SE data we could see that in the tads that were forming fusions basically globally not just at Mick but everywhere uh you could actually see they were more likely to contain super enhancers than those that we wouldn't find any kind of Tad likely arangement we thought well maybe this is interesting and we should include or focus a little bit on super enhancers this kind of anal uh so we've been doing this we've CH chosen now uh sort of a handful of different regions across the genome uh so Mick is here on chromosome 8 we have 1 two 3 four five six seven sites that were uh engineered uh to in this case we have replicates from different sites uh and then we've basically done all of the screening uh and confirmed all of these and then we can ask okay what kind of gene expression do you see uh and so on the left these first two columns are replicates from the cell line that naturally carries this Mick translocation these are the parent cell line that normally don't have uh translocation and don't express Mick and then from here on are all of the Clones that we've done where we've engineered rearrange different glow in gen and I think what you can see which is kind of nice given that we saw this heterogeneity and expression in the the icgc data is we actually could see that there's a fairly broad degree of heterogenea in expression here as well so some of the Clones Express very very very little amounts of Mick and others Express pretty high levels and there's actually almost I think a 500 fold difference between the most induced and the least induced uh clone uh and so we can go back to this kind of super enhancer model and say well does this explain everything and the answer is not exactly but kind of uh so we could see that in uh clones where the breakpoint contained a super enhancer they generally had higher levels of expression uh I I say that sort of but not always because calling super enhancers is not necessarily a definitive there's only one way to do it and your ability to call them depends on whatever parameters you choose and so uh in this case we're basically saying let's try a variety of different parameters to call these uh and so the sites where we sort of reproducibly call them at least relatively so regardless of parameters we generally tend to see slightly higher expression uh but again this is a little bit kind of hand waving and so we wanted to say are there are there better things saying well super enhancers kind of explain this uh and so what we could actually see if we look in particular cases are these interesting examples uh where this is two different events and so there's a little bit of signal right there and they actually they're two different low size so this is on chromosome 12 this is on chromosome 1 uh and they're about the same size the partner regions about a million base pairs they look otherwise very similar but if we look at the gene expression this one uh expresses fairly high levels of Mick whereas this one doesn't induce it much uh at all and we said what's the difference here and what it really comes down to is if you look at the partner region uh so this is this one megabase stretch on chromosome one there's sort of a L of enhancer signal there right so this is hd27 cellation chipseek you look at this region there's there's there's some but not not a whole lot right so we think it's really a product of what we're calling sort of an enhancer load in the partnering uh and this was kind of reminiscent of a recent story that was it's actually it's a preprint from Jesse ing's group where they develop these models that they call activity by contact uh the idea is that through these high through crisper screens they have this kind of relatively simple model for saying does an enhancer regulated Gene and it's essentially the likelihood of this is or the marginal effect is the activity of the enhancer times the contact frequency with the gene that it it's in in proximity to uh and so we can actually apply this kind of same uh model in this case we're not just trying to predict the marginal effect of any enhanc we're actually trying to predict the total level of expression of mix uh and again this is basically a weighted sum of the activity of the enhancers but weighted by the contact frequency with the Mi Gene itself uh and this is basically the the best way that we can find to predict the mick expression in the context of these rearrangements uh and we we've done some sort of alternative things we're saying what about the closest Super enhancer or you just some enhancers you don't wait them by contact and these work this is this explains it to an extent but it's it's just not as good as the activity by context we think this is kind of the the most likely feature or way of explaining this heterogen that we're seeing in MC expression um uh which uh yeah is right here so the other thing that I think is cool and this is really thinking forward in terms of saying can we expand this kind of result to other enag genes or other genes in general in the genome is if we ask well what about other genes at the mck locus are there other genes that we find that are disregulated and the answer is basically no so Mick is in a relative Gene desert uh and there's not that many other genes that are pretty close by but if we compare say Mick we have some clones that have very minimal level of activation I'm basically call negative and some that really activate that I'm calling positive you really don't see any other similar kind of pattern across any of the other genes of the locus so there's something about the MC Gene itself that I think is actually particularly susceptible to these kind of rearrangements uh and I think it's it may you know these activity by contact models I think are really cool but we may have to be smart in terms of saying what genes are actually affected by this um so that is the first part of the talk how am I doing on time okay okay uh so I guess just to kind of summarize uh you know we like tads we think that they're a fundamental feature of Unum organization we think that we can see evidence that they're forming as a result of structural structural variance or form new domains uh we can find evidence of recurrent events uh and um uh we we think that Mick is really one of the sites that's most affected um there's a couple additional lines on here that I didn't really talk about which is that you know not all structural variance necess our activating me I think this goes back to this expression heterogen that we can see uh and that really there's this this uh this super enhancer effect as well as this kind of activity by contact uh consequence um and so now I'll go on to the second part of the talk uh which is really a method development this is something we've been doing in collaboration with Joe eer Lab at Salt uh which is a method development for basically trying to profile do better profiling of 3D genome structure in actual patient uh samples or tumor samples or tissue samples from from real individuals that are complex genus mixture and again I think one of the major goals of this uh you know kind of tying into this idea of thinking about sequence variant is actually to use this to try to better understand um things like a gwos uh linked variant in terms of what the target genes are what the relevant cell types are um uh yeah so I guess that's going back to here so like I said in the introduction you know one reason why people are interested in sort of mapping enhancer promoter connections is to try to better learn what are the Target genes of some variant that we think might disrupt this enhanced function right uh and this is not just kind of a theoretical thing this is actually clearly ongoing sort of human genetics GEOS literature uh and there's kind of one cool example uh from the last several years where this is a Goos you know Manhattan style plot uh for Regions that are uh linked to obesity and the top hit uh in basically every obesity uh gwa study ever is this fto Locus uh and what's interesting is that when people have subsequently done these kind of mapping to try to identify Target genes um what you see is there's this uh this cluster of snips that are in linkage dise equilibrium that are associated with this obesity phenotype and then if you map by high SE they're right here uh they actually seem to form fairly long range contacts with this irx5 and then also with this irx3 Gene right and so that if you actually look in terms of RNA seek data uh classifying patients by either non-risk or risk genotypes you actually see that irx3 and irx5 are the only genes that really show an expression difference in patients based on uh classifying them by risk genotype so in this case I think what this is really saying is that this variant you know even though we say it's within the intron of this fto Gene is really likely regulating these genes that are several hundred kilobases away um and so I think this is really cool and I think that there's more and more of this that's appearing in sort of the human genetics literature of using IC data to try to understand tget genes of gwos polymorphism and I but I think there's some challenges and I think the challenges are really on the the end of the people who generate the data this is kind of an example case which uh this is a recent uh G study in Alzheimer's disease um and they identify you know validated handful of L Identify some new ones and then they have this thing about saying we're going to try to link these to Target genes using chromatin contact data and because of the association of Alzheimer's with microa which is an immune cell type in the brain they say they use spleen and liver High SE data to do this uh yeah so this is obviously not microa uh but I think you know I don't I really don't mean to like you know diminish their study I think this this is very cool but they're basically using the data that's available right so I honestly think this is more a challenge for people like me who generate this kind of data like can we actually generate this in the cell types um and so the question then is well okay microglia that's a very small cell type in the brain how do we actually do this right and so I think what is the ideal approach right is to actually try to D develop methods to identify chroma interactions in these non-coding variants uh and basically what are the relevant cell types for disease function and be right uh and so there's obviously many ways you could do this you could use uh uh you know uh let's say if you get a mouse you could tag some cell with a reporter uh but obviously that's going to be specific to M you can't do that in humans uh you could in theory have an antibody to sort some sort of sell surface marker but that's not necessarily available for every different cell type and it's also not necessarily going to get you a particularly pure population depending upon the cell type in the marker uh and so one way that sort of the Single Cell genomics world has been able to kind of get around the problem is to say that you basically take a complex tissue you perform some sort of single cell experiment in this case this is drop seek so single cell RNA sequencing for each of these cells in this complex mixture is now labeled with some sort of barcode you measure the RNA label you know the barcode and you can use uh you know your favorite tne plot to then identify single cells that look like each other use some sort of clustering and then say well now we have information from each of these constituent cell types based on sort of a ENC silico purification case uh and so we said well in theory right you could do the same kind of thing with high SE data um you know people have done this with other data types as well so this is from our collaborator uh Joe eer lab uh where they've been able to show you can do this with DNA methylation to generate cell type specific uh uh single cell profiles to resolve cell types in this case in the human brain um but one of the challenges with doing this with high SE data is there's sort of intrinsic noise in the system um and we've actually known this for a very long time uh but this is a really kind of nice example of it from a recent paper from Tom stell's lab where um these are basically all I think Mouse embryonic stem cells and they're labeling the same Loi in each case and what you can see is like if you look in this cell the blue and the red are right next to each other the yellow's far away in this cell all three of them are on top of each other and in this cell they're all over the place nobody's next to each other right so this is basically spatial genome organization within what should otherwise be a homogeneous population cells and there's obviously a tremendous amount of variability if you use this to try to do these kind of single cell clustering algorithms you know this intrinsic heterogenity is basically noise that you're throwing on the system so we were concerned or at least we didn't necessarily think that this would be particularly robust to identify particularly related cell type uh and so what we did is kind of borrowing from uh this idea right here that you can do the clustering based on DNA mation we said let's try to develop an assay where we measure both of these things at the same time right so what we we doing is we're we're calling this method multiomic profiling of basically DNA methylation and 3D genome structure we call it uh single nucleus methyl 3C sequencing so SNM 3C SE um and the way that this really works is um you uh uh you basically um the initial steps are just like in a normal high SE experiment you digest you uh we actually omit this fill-in step for sort of technical reasons that if you're interested we can talk about later uh so we basically just do a ligation we then this is all occurring within an intact nucleus so you sort nuclei into 384 o plates and then you can take this basically through a protocol for doing single cell bisulfite sequencing that was developed in Joe eer La uh and then at the end you get barcoded data from each cell can sequence this on a sequencer and get in this case both 3D genome and methylation data from the same cell um so we do some controls uh basically we say uh if we generate this now in a bunch of different single cells we get very sparse contact maps from any individual cell we get very sparse D methylation profiles from any individual cell this is pretty typical for single cell data uh if we pull them in bulk we can actually recapitulate the same kind of patterns you see in bulk IC data right uh and then we can actually see some patterns that we think are cell type specific so this is uh for Mouse es cells they have this kind of small t at the socks 2 Locus that's actually lost in uh cells that are not es cells so it's specific to es cells and when we profile this in es so we still we think you know the data is kind of noisy in this case but we think there's still this kind of small tat there uh and we can also see that it recapitulates the DNA methylation patterns that are observed uh uh in this case comparing at the dppa 4 and two Locus um and so we've been able to do this and we can now apply this in particular settings so one uh you know basically doing this is control is we apply this to two different mouth cell lines embryonic stem cells and this mammory GL gland cell line um to basically say can we use this can you actually distinguish the two cell types from each other and so if we use the DNA methylation data we can very clearly and easily uh separate the uh the mamory gland from the mouse ESL data uh if we're using contacts we can still do this but it actually requires a little bit of work we have to kind of play around with the conditions in order to identify it and uh so at the end of the day I I really think the methylation is a considerably more robust uh way of partitioning these cell types than the contact data I'll show you another example of this in a minute yes yes well so that's the thing the dominant component here is not separating by cell type either that this first principal component is actually coverage so clearly the coverage like basically you separate cells better at higher coverage this is negatively correlated with coverage whereas at low coverage you don't so I think the the issue is you know if we had super high coverage maybe this works as well as DNA methylation uh but you know the coverage is the same in terms of the genome in both cells either it's the same data right so I think what it really comes down to is the partitioning uh in terms of the the sparsity of the data is just better with d methylation compared to this um oh uh so the thing that we've done that we've kind of Applied this in a cool setting uh is we've we've basically applied the sample now to actual human brain tissue so this is from um uh postmortem individuals prefrontal cortex uh we basically put it through the protocol and we include a sorting step to to bias for the uh generation of neurons I didn't actually know this before we started but dominant cell type in the human brain is not neurons it's basically gal cells which I didn't know I'm not a neuroscientist um but yeah so we can we bias for neurons and then we can apply this to the method uh and then we you know as as everyone else does in a single cell experiment we generate some T plots uh and so we can do this and now begin to classify different cell types uh and there's a couple cool things that I think about this so this is doing the clustering based on CG methylation which is sort of the classical uh methyl context in in terms of the cpg dinucleotide uh you can actually distinguish all these different cells particularly well but fairly well when you do this you can also do this with non-cg methylation this is actually rare in most cells but is actually fairly highly uh present in the brain as well as in heart tissue uh and you can actually see that non-cg methylation doesn't actually distinguish gal cells like lendr sites or miclea but it does a very good job of distinguishing neurons from each other uh and then we do the same thing for high SE what's interesting is the high SE data can actually distinguish uh some of the non neuronal cell types so it does a decent job of distinguishing endites asites uh uh endothelial cells but we get this giant ball cluster here of neurons right so it doesn't do a particular job of distinguish so I think it's kind of reassuring because it's like well that was the whole point of doing this in the first place is to try to see if we could use this to distinguish potentially related cell types um and there is some structure there like this T half tends to be excitatory and this half tends to be inhibitory but they're within the subtypes they're really still all clust they're mixed together um and so then I guess this is a couple examples so the part of the way that you do the cell type classification is you're basically looking for hypomethylation over either Gene Gene bodies or Gene promoters because we don't have RNA data in here uh Vector MH but in it's a yes project that low Dimension how you do thech uh so the there there's I get I mean there's actually multiple ways of doing clustering based on high SE data I think there's actually people in the audience who know this particularly well uh so um there there are ways of there's there's several approaches for doing this you can assign some uh uh there's like a multi-dimensional scaling type approach to assign a difference uhhuh yes yes necessarily yes I guess I don't totally follow um yeah I mean so there there's there's a handful of approaches that you can use so so the these the initial input here right you have the the data would be 4,000 cells in in the case of methylation a vector of the number of bins in genome right so in theory right you can do something similar for hia you could just concatenate it out into a vector uh I think the other sort of logical way is you actually convert this you do principal component analysis on the individual cell Matrix and then do clustering on the principal component uh so there there's a few different approaches that can be used for doing this yeah uh I yeah I I I honestly the the the clustering algorithm for this specific thing was done by a student in Joe eer lab who's really interested um so I don't know all exactly which of those approaches he used for this um uh yeah and so in terms of the cell types right so basically we can see if we look at this Gene satb2 which is known to be a marker of excitatory neurons we can see that this cluster in the middle basically has very low levels of fat B2 methylation so this is what we think are the excitatory neurons which would be this population here Fox P2 also marks excitatory but it's specifically deep layer excitatory neurons so this region is uh hypomethylated this is methylated so these would be the Deep layer excitatory neurons so this is basically one way in which you can kind of reconstruct which populations and which uh cell types are here um and so then this is an example of that satb2 Locus and so what we've done here is we've taken say all these excitatory neurons and pulled the chrom and contact data together to generate a pseudo bulk map at this point and so in this case we're comparing excitatory versus the inhibitory classes and again sat B2 which is right here is this well-known marker Gene of excitatory neurons and we see that there are these sort of uh an array of different contacts that are forming in uh excitatory neurons that are basically completely absent in inhibitory neurons uh so we think that we can actually Identify some cell type specific looping and structural events Cas um and so then one kind of just cool example of where we kind of want to go with this in the future this isn't actually in the paper so this is a recent schizophrenia gwas study where they they identify a handful of different Loi they can validate some of these uh and so there's one that they identify that they say is a new Locus they have associated with schizophrenia uh it's this potential snip right here it a very narrow window of linkage equilibrium uh and it's in this relatively Gene poor region of the genome uh what's kind of interesting is by comparing with the DNA methylation and it doesn't show up well here this is specifically in a hypomethylated intergenic region in layer 23 excitatory neur neur whereas it say not in microa or asites and if we look at the high SE data we can see that the highy data in layer 2 three neurons uh shows actually very sort of specific long range contacts with this chrm3 Gene that are basically absent in say asites or microa so we think from this we can begin to infer things that this snip is probably relevant in uh in layer 2 three excitatory neurons and we think likely probably regulating this CR uh chrm oh okay oh cool okay nice cool okay um that's great um yeah so uh okay so yeah this is basically the summary for the second part I think I'm kind of running out of time so I can go over this quickly that basically we've developed a method for this multiomic profiling that we think is really interesting uh to allow for basically profiling 3D genome structure in uh Vivo inside real complex tissues uh and this is to acknowledge the people who did the work uh this is based in my lab uh dongs is the the lead author on the uh the paper that uh actually was just published in nature uh methods um about the Single Cell profiling um the the first part has really been a team effort between a variety of different people in the lab including dongs and gcha as well as some technicians who subsequently left the lab uh and with that I will take questions oh yeah also collaborators very good collaborators in terms of the Neilon profiling uh with that I'll stop and take any [Applause] questions question you I was wondering if you could say something about trans interacting I mean s regulatory domains are part of the story but I think you know with some of the work you were doing with the Mech you were opening the door for Trans interactions especially with the with that uh crisper cast experiment you were doing yeah I mean so the the you know the mick engineering type thing those are still technically in Cy because it's a rearranged a um so uh in terms of like basically if you had a kot typically normal cell line um trans interactions are pretty rare that you get these kind of UK chromatic heterochromatic associations uh but generally speaking from a standpoint of like enhancer Gene it's pretty rare um there is actually some very super yeah well so there there's very very cool data from stabos Lombardo's lab in a factory neuron where they form these giant clusters and they actually can clearly see sort of enhancer to Gene interactions between different chromosomes uh that seem to be critical for driving specific uh expression so so it it is out there I'd say it's you know that's a very specialized cell type where that's a unique structure so going with the same question so I don't know you familiar with this notion of composite LD you talk about linkage dise equilibrium there there's another notion that you can have the LD in between gametes okay so it's a it's very this is introduced by Bruce we at University of Washington okay and and and and how that that uh understanding and what you're doing maybe you're not familiar with composite not not particularly okay okay I mean I do think that there's interesting things to think about yeah from the standpoint of um you know you could you could imagine that you know LD block for that TI right it's a very narrow window right the target Gene is outside the block so in some level it actually really matters not just what you inherit there but probably other regions so you could imagine there might be a second snip that's right at the Locust that may be affecting the gene so I think that it makes for potentially really complex interplay if there's multiple Wheels population [Music] expression uh it was a fascinating talk I actually had a question about the definition of these Tad boundaries themselves uh you mentioned that they're highly conserved across lineages and I wonder part and you mentioned the loop Extrusion model as well I wonder there are inbuilt uh uh mechanisms of how this is so uh highly reproducible between cell types and Beyond cdcf I mean are there other players that are known or implicated in this uh definition of boundaries um so the Beyond cpcf is a bit of a that that could be a very long response in in in dropa the answer is yes absolutely the Elegance yes absolutely uh in mammals it's a little bit harder there are experiments where people have completely depleted ctcf and you lose the vast majority of tads and Tad boundary but there are actually some that are retained or at least you know partially retained so it could be that there are additional factors that contribute to it but I think that for the most part cdcf is driving it but I think terms of the fact that these are sort of ubiquitous between cell types you know ctcf is expressed like a housekeep so it's it's basically invariant in terms of pression patterns um and I think that when you look at the boundaries that we see that are very very consistently called in different cell types they tend to be associated with the most invariable binding sites of ctcx and the genome so that you can have some ctcf binding sites that are unique and those May contribute to things like cell type specific interactions but there's clearly a a subset of ctcf finding sites that just hardly ever change uh and what defines that is I I don't entirely know I think it's it's quite interesting there's probably a variety of things that might contribute to it um we we know that th those tend to be more uh GC Rich regions of the genome so that might be that they're Som deible just as a baseline state but so uh in your single set experiment where you use T near method to Cluster different cell types so you have three kinds of feature uh the first based on mation and then based on high SE so uh the result of uh such kind of clustering depends on how you define the dimensions for mulation the number of Dimension is linearly related to the length while for high SE is quadratic so how do you think the high SE clustering is worse partly because the the higher Dimension data uh I mean I think the answer is yes so I think one of the issues is uh kind of going back to the 1D versus 2D thing so let's say let's say we have you know um you you break up the genome into 50 kilobase vs you're going to expect a certain amount of coverage per bin from the methylome data from a one-dimensional vector right if you then consider the Matrix right that same data is now being uh basically diluted out in that space square right so it's far far more sparse in terms of what you actually observe in The Matrix compared to what you see in a one-dimensional ventilation uh so I think like you know when when we pull the data together right you can see that there are differences I just think that with any of those specific single contacts you probably just don't see that really defined very frequently when you look across the different cell types so I think that's basically what it com down to at least that's my guess very nice talk so when when people have a abolished expression of cohes or ctcf there's a remarkable little effect on gene expression overall though kind of questions the role of tads in regulating genes do you think it's more to regulate enhancer Gene interaction or can you also Envision that it has something to do with more of a um DNA damage response that you compartmentalize the genome into smaller units that can be used for repair and so for us yeah I mean I I think it's so I guess there's two parts there's clearly things that tads seem to be doing independent from Gene regulation so they're clearly associated with DNA replication timing uh I think there there's not lot there's growing evidence that they're associated with genan repair uh and so in that sense I think there may be a reason why a cell has a tad that's not from a gene expression to from the standpoint of Gene regulation like one thing that I think these activity by contact models suggest is that what like how a gene would respond to something like cohesive incretion is going to depend tremendously on where the enhancers are that regulated so that a gene that would be say responsive to cohesion I would expect that it would not have any enhancers near the gene itself because if you deplete cohesion you lose these kind of looping features but the dominant kind of distance Decay that you see in the data that doesn't really change right so if there's a proximal enhancer in the absence of cohesion I bet I can still find the gene in turn on uh and so I like at least my interpretation of those kind of results is actually that like these effects of super enhancers uh that might actually be the most dominant feature in terms of what tads might be doing and why they might be relevant for Gene regulation is actually to help facilitate this kind of longrange super enhan by contact uh because I think you know these activity contact models are really interesting and cool uh but that is sort of one implication right is that if you're going to have an enhancer that's a million bases away it's got to be a really strong enhan regular P I just want to see if there was you know you had C Mick there I mean that's a Yan yanaka factor I mean you know so that's special thing I mean you know have you looked is there some kind of special way I mean you talked about its structure you expect to see the other y factors acting like that yeah I mean that's so sock 2 is definitely has these really interesting ways that it uses enh but that's more in the context of um you know uh uh like developmental regulation of the gene so from es cells to neuro cells uh Nan for I don't quite know much about you know if how much they're using these kind of long range factors might be an interesting to look yeah there might be some ofal way creating that extra block that that could be a really neat yeah no predict that know that would be starting hypoth probably easy experim yeah so I was really interested you uh drove High expression being related to the overall enhancer load as opposed to you know a specific super enhancer and if there's this idea that a super enhancer is really a a collection of of individual transcription Factor binding units that are all clustered in one place that you're sort of seeing a similar effect when they're more distributed but there's still a lot of them and so I'm curious um about what we can learn from high SE data in terms of resolution to look at those individual elements um do we what are the limitations are the limitations at this point well sequencing depth it it seems like we're uh we're able to overcome that if we have a big enough budget um the resolution in terms of restriction sites and maybe getting over that with something like microc or where we're we're cutting more frequently um but ultimately do you think that this technology is able to resolve interactions at a fine scale or are enhancers inherently uh acting without direct contact and by recruiting things to a Zone and so the best you're ever going to get are kind of these stripes when you have clusters of enhancers in the same region I so I I tend to kind of think the latter that I I actually think that if so if you look in high SE data right and you you have even high resolution data uh you know five billion read kind of thing if you you see at one kilobase resolution that two sites interact if you look one kilobase away you're still going to see that they have a high intera so there's a there's a strong um sort of correlation in terms of the local effects that you see in the matri so the the real question is is that is that biological or is that there's like some noise and some signal that's being dissipated that's much harder to answer I think that on some of like has to be biological at least part of it because the chromosome is basically a polymer right and so if if two loai are close that means the LOI immediately adjacent to it is also close uh so I I think that that that feature is going to be there even if you get better and better data like you have Micro C data and that gives you even higher resolution um it's possible that you could you know maybe if you really really sequence not just like five billion weeds but like a trillion reads you might be able to see that but that's getting to be crazy I don't even know how much you'd have to spend to do that and and so in that sense I think if you're going to find that it would have to be you aggregate features together accumulate you know you do these metagene sty a comment I think that that should come from combination of Imaging and biochemical technique and then you have to render mathematically how you combine this two two two biochemical and imaging and then you can reconstruct the new new new object then you can render a shap that I mean I think one one technique alone the genetics I think are also critical right you have to I think that you know they're hard experiments but going in and bashing enhancers with chrisper you learn a lot from that kind of experiment okay cool yeah great yeah keep it up thanks again just wonderful thank you so [Applause] [Music] this is this notion of composite LD so this is I took CL this like so let's see yes see so so this is this is Mom and Dad right so the LD means in some sense like independence of
