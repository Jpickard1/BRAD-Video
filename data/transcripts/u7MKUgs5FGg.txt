how are you gonna ending here than just for the camera yeah [Music] okay all right well thank you all for coming uh it is great to be able to introduce jeongyeon who's giving our seminar for today after a really long flight up from the chemistry building so she got her BS in physics at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2003 went to MIT for a doctoral degree on in the vendor garden lab which she received in 2009 and then did a postdoc at Stanford in James Farrell's lab and so Sean has been here as a faculty member since January of 2014 her lab has some really great papers out she has also a ton of awards that I wish I had including the career award from the NSF Alfred Sloan fellowship Burroughs Wellcome fund grants so really some great work going on here I know her lab has been doing some really interesting work both using computational and experimental approaches to look at oscillators in the context of development I think that is what we're going to hear about today so or to it thank you very much Peter for this kind introduction so an example all for coming I undergrads here to share some of the work that you've been working in my lab I wanted to start with this video of a giant cell this is the egg of the Xenopus and after fertilization and you will see that this cell is basically chopped into smaller and smaller pieces in a highly precise and synchronized and a clock like manner about every 25 minutes so indeed this precise cleavage processes is controlled by a clock it's called a mitotic oscillator and over the past decades the major players of this mitotic oscillator has been discovered and we understand the basics of this now just so quickly goes through the current understanding on this clock so in the interface on where the cycling via amara is departed from the mother and it will be translated into the secondly protein and this protein will bind to cyclin-dependent kinase to activate it at once cdk1 is activated it will activate its own repressor it's a anaphase promoting complex or a PCC this is Ryu because unlike is that will target Tegrity for degradation so therefore for the second P line here you will see that when B is the translated during the interface and addict radial as my particle face what's interesting about is the blue line here which is acidic a1 dynamics so what you see here is even though cycling be binds to ctp while instability has the ability to activate it technically whites don't turn all right away instead that there is this long time delay and this is because at the interface there is a high level of the we one kinase which is an inhibitor so what we want does is basically phosphorous on to phosphorylation sites of the city k1 to keep it at the off state and he all cycling the riches are very high threshold that's when the city k1 turns on now when silicon we want turns out it's also a repressor of the we 1 itself so that form the double negative feedback loop there's another protein here are called CDC 25 this is a kind this is a phosphatase and this one basically remove the same phosphor group that we want phosphorylated city K was so that's therefore it's a activator of the silicon one and again active silica won't activate at CDC 25 so therefore it forms a double positive feedback loop so together of this double negative and double positive feedback loops and make the city k1 switch from off state to on state in a very sharp manner and later I we know that it's it's basically formed a bi-stable switch so that is understood to make the mitotic entry irreversible so therefore this double negative one double pulse you feel the loop even though they are not required of oscillation they're still very important to perform certain function for this cell cycle taco is just one of the many many oscillators that some of you may be familiar with that we know of that controls many essential cellular physiological and developmental processes so the ones that starting from the South second neuron spike on to heart beats about one second and then cell cycles itself spend a very wide range of the period and then we have this developmental clock called a segmentation clock which I will talk a little bit later and now we have this circadian clock to control the sleep cycles and many others so you will see that these clouds behaved very differently so they there are timescales per orders of magnitudes and they look very different but as a physicist by training one of the essential question in the lab is we wonder if we have like some common design principles that may be shared among all these similarly different clocks to control certain functions the the few reasons which I will point out so first of all if you interrupt any of these cogs you won't get all kinds of diseases so it's very important to study the function so what maintains the function but the reason that I think there it's possible to identify some common design principles is that for all these clocks even though they appear to be different they seem to share some common functions so the first notable function is a tune ability so many clocks like a heartbeat or cell cycle they respond to environmental cue so their frequency can be tuned largely based on the like say temperature in the environment or light or nutrition however there are amplitude stay in a more or less stable physiological range so that's our to nobility to nobility in frequency so that's one property that seems to be important to many clocks so another important thing the robustness and that's actually very important for many many biological system not just occult well folklore is especially important because for any timing machine we wanted to be there accurately to guide the whatever the process is that we are interested in so to understand the design principle underlying these two functions it can be challenging if we are looking into all these molecular details so you feel just a take a like south circle as an example if you take the data from the database you're found out it's easily having hundreds of molecules that recognizes south psycho processes so it's very hard to identify or gain the insight what are the important key fundamental principles so instead my lab used a different approach it's called society web our to approach so here the goal is to ask how we design a minimum oscillator that can perform the same function that complicated a network to that maybe we can learn from this minimum designs about the more complicated systems so this idea is not very hard it's all very new in terms of the theory because the in theory we can't design like this think of negative feedback oscillator dated back to this good so in this in this network basically you can have very simple three node system so you have gene a that can transcribe 2mr ad and then translated to protein c if c repress itself that forms that's in going up to feedback but because of the transcription and translation you also have this essential time delays so that your single negative feedback is not tampering into a stable steady state so this idea was pretty old but the the real engineer the oscillatory experiments is more recent so the first arguably the the first engine like oscillator can be this work by my clothes and a stapler they formed this the single negative feedback three genes they're oppressed one another to form what they accorded repress later and if they put this repress later into the e.coli cells about the 40% of the e.coli cells can perform itself sustained oscillations but that's not bad and three years after Alexander an in-class group actually on on our campus here so they design the additional positive feedback that coupled with this negative feedback so what's interesting about the last design is it looks like um if we do a survey of all the natural oscillators even though their molecular regulators are quite different they all seem to share this couple the positive and negative feedback group so one question here is if we know the negative feedback loop is essential for the surfaces and oscillations now what's a row of the positive feedback Y evolutionary you will see this again and again in all kinds of the different systems so this question was earlier Oscar by a computational paper in Jim Pharaohs lab so here what they study is to compare three different topologies they all share the same core which is a repressilator and then in one of them they added self other to feedback in another the other self negative feedback and then they score for their performance by a random parameter scale so if they found that for for one topology that has more parameter sets to support this topology for oscillations and they will say this topology is more robust that's a quantification for robustness so what they found here is only the middle one where you have the self positive feedback as a more robust the behavior but not the negative or the core it's all so their conclusion here is the positive feedback can improve the robustness of the oscillator but more recently there is our experimental study so here they they basically use engineer the bacteria that can interacting with each other through common sensing and the brain here is activator bacteria so it can activate itself and also activate the neighboring like other species yellow ethereal and on the other hand the yellow bacteria is the repressor bacteria so it can also prepare the green bacteria against your constancy so now if they engineer additional negative feedback to this circuit they found is more robust so then their conclusion is a negative feedback increase the robustness so you will see that here that there seems to be a different view of which works better for increasing robustness right so what we think is maybe the problem is that in each of these studies they only focus on one specific record however our if we appreciate the right in nature we we can have all kinds of different designs to achieve the same function even though some might work better than the other but if we want to identify the most fundamental principles we have to look at them all instead of just subset of apologies the directory is a motivation for this computational work is led by a very talented a graduate student generally so he has already graduated in May it's now a postdoc iing Jim Ferris lab also in this work we basically look at a topology space for three node networks so all possible our rings instead of just one or two and you will see that there are three thousand three hundred and twenty five possible topologies we can look at and then for each topology we do a random parameter skin just like water in James lab do and then to map that in parameter space and then we of Cour here also score for the robustness of the certain topology the in this case it's basically the volume of this parameter space that can support this topology for oscillation and if the volume is larger for one topology then the other topology we say it's more robust than the other topology okay so with this system we can identify a total of fourteen hundred and twenty clogged topologies you know they can add some specific parameters as they can oscillate so we define them as a clogged topology so we arrange them such that these topologies the complexity is ranging from low to high scored by the number of the edges they have and within each row they have the same complexity and we also arrange them sort ism based on the Q value which is a hit rate in the parameter space so in another word it's a robustness modification so the love the most the the orange one is most robust apologies and the rightmost which is a blue one it's least a robust apologies okay so now each thing goes out here is one topology and they can connect one another by adding or removing a node or edge to becoming another topology so the frankly nodes you can see all of them are connecting with each other that maybe they means that also evolutionary we can always find some kind of evolutionary paths to evolve from the simplicity design to the most complicated design without losing one so this listener basically is or the whole atlas of the clock topologies so what we can learn from them so first of all we are interested in the most the minimum design right so which is the bottom eight of them so the minimum means that if you remove any node or edge it's just a stop ability for oscillation so we also call is that a course because the eight apologies are the roots of all the other apologies so what are they so we sorted them again based on the q-value robustness and we found that the top three most robust the ones are the ones that we are familiar with we introduced before which is a repressilator the positive a couple with negative feedback loop and a googly oscillator and these three seems to be orders of magnitude a higher in robustness than the rest of the five so then we say these three are the robust course and then these five are non robust of course and so the question is can we explain all the complicated topology robustness based on just to the core compositions they have so to find out the group all these apologies in the address based on the core composition there so the empty here means that none of the apologies within this group has any other three core robust force they can have any of any combination of the five non robust of course and so on average we seem that the more robust the course they have the more robots they are because this is a percentile rank percentile of the Q value so the smaller of value is a more robust they are so so it means on average I mean that's not surprising um however if we look closer to the topology within one group we will have a puzzle here so for example here within this group so all of them share the same core but their behavior varied in a large range so what caused that variability so that's one thing keep in mind another thing that we didn't understand at the time was if we look closer to the core topologies we found out intuitively we would not be able to tell whether the core 2 will be more robust than course 6 because both core 2 and of course 6 has a slow that you feedback loop how about who is a fast positive feedback loop so however their behavior their their Q value or differ by a factor of 45 so what caused out and what's more interesting is if we do a survey in the nature we found out almost all oscillators we know about as a core to design but never as a core six okay that's another question but then we think maybe on when we look at these pathologies we miss some facts about local interaction also matters so to find out the local interaction like how what kind of local interaction we call a motif really plays an important role we do a pairwise comparison for any two neighbors of the atlas that I just show you so by neighbor means that again it's connection with each other so by removing or adding an actual node they can convert into each other so then we decompose each each topology into two edge motives so this Twitter motive indicates the interaction as a node and then we will take into account the difference of the two edge motive of these two neighbors and the difference of their output which is a robustness the rank percentile and now we use some statistical tools so it's linear regression technique and compared with partial rank correlation coefficient it seems that both of them identify the same patterns and so namely that we found that these three motives help so oscillator model passed and what are these three the district has a note that receiving two inputs of different signs so it's the opposite regulation um and then the top floor here is decreasing robustness and which are all have a note that receiving the two inputs of the same size then we call the table as a coherent and input motive and then the bottom as a encode here and the input motif so whether they can play the functioning of the whole topology we now do the group again so now instead of one dimension we do two dimensions so basically we group the topology is just by counting so we can't how many numbers of the nodes that they have incoherent input versus coherent input I know we found out the more nodes they have incoherent input the less they have the cohering inputs the more robust they are and this effect seems to be additive so again if we want to design some robust oscillators this may be useful because we can just count how many we can avoid incoherent and add more incoherent inputs into the network so this seems also unified the previous findings on because for dreams of work right so here the positive feedback must be added to increase the robustness because it's generated or incoherent input here and here you would need to have a negative feedback in order to generate incoherent inputs and it seems this incoherent input motif are also enriched in the natural oscillators and synthetical oscillators we know about so basically to conclude here is we have done a computational study to show that pathology you can play an important role to change the behavior of the oscillators and we found that it seems incoherent and in putting interaction and helps the oscillation robustness this may explain why in nature we have very complicated designs and many peripheral structures are not required of oscillation a still evolutionary conserved so maybe they are evolution conserved for some certain functions that these clocks needs to have but these are also computational studies to really find out we have to rely on the experimental designs so in our lab we're focusing on cell cycles because well star goes first always as always the interesting topology of our ring that I used can be used to test computational studies and it's it's a it's very challenging to study cell psychology in live cells or live embryos so out of all these challenging reasons like low throughput hard to manipulate the most tricky one is so for any cell cycle in the lifestyle for for any cycle to complete you always end up with the cell division and that's our division we'll introduce some kind of partition arrows and some other complicated stuff that we may not understand fully so it seems that we need to design a simpler system so here here's our strategy so what do we do here is we basically take all these eggs group them together and break them down and then we take the cytosolic apart inject into the microfluidic a chamber filled with oil the data allows us to generate this watering oil emotion and the specific size that we want and that recorded artificial cells and I will show you that while we record it this way so basically once we have these droplets we consider it as a cell we load it in the chamber and then incubate for many many hours and I trap using fluorescence microscopy and the imaging processing okay so in this system we are first reconstitute the might audio cycle inside this simple system and I hope you can see here so when we show here is a single droplet it's a very simple system you don't even see it your name inside so and on the right here is a bright field and on the left here is a fluorescence channel where we use a fluorescent reporter called securing I'm charring the security is anaphase substrate which can be translated that during the interphase and keep your idea that might hard workers so therefore you will see this oscillation and to show that it's not artifact from any you know fluorescence reporters we also attached the same straight with easy with ease EFT a different floor for I will show that the behavior is very similar okay so that is basically the simplest impossible ourselves we can feel because it's a cell cycle oscillates for many many times and and there's no DNA however if we add DNA into the system it can self-assemble nuclei and and this nuclei event seems to be downstream of this oscillator so oscillatory functions in this way which is to control the nuclear envelope breakdown and a chromosome condensation in a periodic manner so we use a GFP NOS which is a nuclear localization signal but that that can report the nuclear and load breakdown events because in the interface where nuclear is the intact you will have all these fluorescent protein located into the nuclei but when the nuclear envelope breaks down you will see that it's uniformly distributed into itself and correlative Li you will see that from some condensed during the nuclear envelope breakdown and at the same time the security grating as a metal case but it won't be easier if you if we can track one single droplet for different channels and we can see that this droplet oscillator for two circles from interface mitotic phase in the face and mitotic phase and I hope you can see this correlation events and interestingly the brighter image you can also see this contrast of the nuclear envelope here okay so we have this with more complicated so that behaves similarly as a real self so basically we have this system and we want to see what we can do with it so before that I want to show you the the property of these oscillations so first of all this single droplet seems to oscillate are very well so it has in this case 30 32 cycles over for days we know that if people are working with an open system we know that for any bulk system it's hardly oscillator beyond a few cycles so that means in the micro environment that somehow improves our ability for oscillations so that's good but also we found this weird of behavior where we we see that over time we have increased the baseline increase the amplitude and increased the period and to show that it's not again it's not the floor for specific she also has another floor for a CFG and it has a similar behavior so basically over time we have increased the increase the amplitude and increase the period and we can quantify it here ok so what's going on here so in this system we basically take the service or out so we throw away the yoke and we have probably some limited amount of mitochondria you're there but most of the nutrition stuff is gone and so so consider some circles out of the equilibrium process and then consume a lot of energy and in our system we can consider it's a limited energy source to start with so over time we have to consider energy consumption in this case so in our standard cell cycle model where we don't consider ATP we assume it it is a lot we don't don't have the limitation of the ATP then you will see that this oscillation is basically stable limit cycle with stable amplitude however if we consider ATP limitation here so what what happens is so for silicon one activation and inactivation it's controlled by this double positive and double negative as I introduced them from the beginning so the we were in the city 225 our antagonized events so the when you have a lot of ATP the the we one basically is the phosphorylated which is an inactive form and the CDC 25 would be also false religion which active form and that means you you now have excessive amount of the activator of the city K wildland repressor so therefore the system is driving to the activation process that's suggest an intuitive explanation but if we include that in our model we will show that it can recapitulate the basic properties of the oscillation that we see experimental but whether this is a true and this is just some model hypothesis right so we need to design some experiment with tested so here our Shriya is leading this project and collaborate with a new girl here Daniel so what they do here is they first tested the system by adding different amount of the ATP so this is the energy mix it's an energy regeneration system so you feel add like more and more ATP here you found out within each group you still see this increase in pure than the amplitude however if you compare across a group you'll find out the more ATP you have or the last period and the last amplitude that you will have which is as predicted in the model and then you will be able to see clearly more clearly if you just do a simple qualification to group all these simple traces of oscillation okay so that is a one preliminary data so ok so one thing we also note his lot is if we separately looking at the writing phase of the securing and the falling phase of Statuary you know the rising phase is the interface the translating of the securing and Napoleon phases and we found that the ATP seems only effect in the rising phase the interface but the mitotic phase is ppm pretty stable it doesn't care how much ATP you have and that means that the interface well the mitotic phase is very robust and it's basically keeping a certain on a time scale and that seems to be all supported by another study using the mammalian cell lines they found it's more noisy in other cell cycle phase strategy-wise g2 phase but it's more accurately controlled in the mitotic phase and we also found it's it's a same behavior for the more complicated cells where you introduce the nuclei and in this case we're using the geosphere noise and as a reporter so for from here you will see the standard deviation of the intensity to show the GOP localization signal and you will quantify the period in this way and you found out the interface it's variable and the mitotic phase is pretty stable and in fact we can use our cell cycle model to explain it and so our cell cycle model is a relaxation type of oscillator and it contains the positive feedback group that seems to be important to insulate the mitotic phase to keep it the precise okay so that's basically what we can do in experimental system by adding different amount of the ATP to start with but that only controls the bulk ATP concentration and then we do not have the specific knowledge about each individual oscillator behavior in terms of the ATP and oscillator behavior so to find it out chiana mon collaborate and then design this experiment so what they do here is they have this the pressure based microfluidic control system to basically so in this case you have three gimlet so the left here is just the extract with some other reporters and right here is the extract with the ATP and you also have different dyes to tell how much of these molecules is encapsulated in each droplet the innocence you're basically based on the dye intensity to tell how much ATP you have in us so for example here the red here the reddit droplet here has the most ATP and the yellow copy released the ATP and it can be controlled by pressure so that means we can have a gradual tuning of that parameter dimension so I hope you can start to see some kind of correlations in terms of the intensity and the oscillation behavior and I mean this abides in short out that shear analyzer and it seems to confirm it but basically the more ATP you have the x axis here the faster of the oscillation and also the smaller of the amplitude and it also confirmed the previous findings about the phase dependent ATP like a phase dependent of behavior controlled by ATP so for example the interphase which is a top here is a rising period it's very variable and my particle phase the falling phase here is pretty much tight when you control the within a certain range okay so that's that's our preliminary results for the ATP dependent like a behavior but one thing we are still missing here is for our current experiment or design there are some drawbacks first of all at the bottom here you're using the anaphase reporter which is the which is controlled by a PC that's a repressor of cdk1 so it's not a direct indicator of the city k1 activity so to really find out the city p1 activity we have to use another sensor so in this case we adapt a sensor designed by Trump eyes group and it's a threat the dk1 sensor and that's our preliminary results and so basically we are hoping to improve optimizes sensor for our study to replace the securing reporter and another thing is we know that over time the ATP is consumed so even though we can control initially how much ATP we can distribute it in the droplets right we cannot control over time you'll be all time but then that means it's very important for us to have the ability to measure ATP in real time so though we also adapted ATP of sensor it's called Queen and then to basically measure the ATP in real time in the same droplet with another reporter to measure the mitotic oscillator so that's at your outer correlation um so now I want to switch it up here to basically show you what other things we can do in the lab right using the same system here so as when I said the tunability is very important on clock functions and I listen here for all these clocks that have the wide range by the ability I mean the ability to tune the oscillation in you know wide range frequency so what caused that that's that's our question so well the frequency tuning and amplitude amplitude that you name both have been phoning in signaling molecule I mean similarly in networks and the the basically understanding about these two is the frequency tuning can make the coordinated tuning of the downstream genes like I say strong G a and a weak gene the coordinating well the amplitude attorney cannot that's so that's one understanding here in our cell cycle we think that the the frequency tuning might be related to the positive feedback here based on a previous study again by Jim's lab so in this study they look at this cell cycle model and they basically computationally varies or positive feedback strands so in this case it's our here so the higher strength of the audio feedback the wider of the tuning you can do in frequency so that's a model prediction no no experimental study yet and also that's just a one specific way so cycle model and we wonder if this positive feedback on the important of fortune ability can be generalizable to other type of oscillators the in this study agenda use the same framework that he used them for robustness and in this case in addition to random parameters can he also start from this random Center and I do at uni for both sides until always finds a boundary so and then it can basically map out what's a frequency behavior is changing across this tuning range and that's two examples here so one is a good way to oscillator a couple of it's a positive feel about the other is acutally a slick pulla wizard now getting feedback and what he found is for the second case here where you have the negative absolute I mean negative feedback couple you'll find out most of these journeys on hanging amplitude and it's very hardly cheering in frequency and only if you have this case where you have the positive feedback we start to have these frequency tuning mode there seems to support the previous finding for cell cycle and so we want to see if we can design experiments as this idea so the most intuitive tuning for cell cycle might be temperature right so for many of you if you're doing studies of different cells to find out if you change temperature at different range and you can change the oscillation speed so here are Mon what I mean in my lab he has it either in a temperature gradient or chamber so basically the idea is to be able to turn the job place across this pressure gradient and to see all the behavior of that so that's one way but that is more global tuning because if you're very temperature you you're very lot of parameters and so here we wonder if we can do a more direct at uni so in this case we know that the total input is cyclin D so if you add more second in the MRA you can tune the oscillator it of so that maybe is also it has a dual function it has n terminus and C terminus so the N terminus basically share the same sequence as the recognition of the securing but both of them are recognized by a PC so it can be used as a reporter for degradation in the anaphase but on the other hand the c-terminus of sacrum be combined GDP one for activation so if we add different amount of the Tempe tag manually right this is a preliminary data we can see that we can tune the oscillator feed from the period from about somewhere about 158 minutes to somewhere below 100 minutes so that's a some reasonable dynamic range but that's very lows to report because we have to add at the second being manually so we wonder if we can use this pressure driven by colluding with chamber again for this project so basically we have these three Inlet attuning again and then for each Inlet can basically add a different drugs or in common are molecules to chill at the different arranged across the different range you know you know very continuous manner so there's the some pretty mean results it's a busy slide but I just quickly go through here so first with this set up we wonder how we remove the endogenous cycling because in our extract system there are going to be already deposited from the mother so we can add them openly nose of the dinner per second each would remove now also tune the oscillator has a slower range and if we want to get to the faster range we basically add the human second D which is not recognized by Jennifer's popolino I can increase it the speed but basically we can tune the oscillator in post structure so the table results here show the more no works because if you add more morpholino here the percentage of the droplet oscillation shots and also if you add more mobile Ino here as a y-axis you will see that the period increase which is as expected so with that we had a substantial amount of the morpholino to get rid of all the Tonopah 70 and then on the other hand we can add a human cycling need and also as a wee one inhibitor because we can tune in post emotions so the we were here you know here is to remove to reduce a positively attack stress but basically in the model we predicted that the higher of the positive stress the higher tunability you have have so in this case it seems to show that case also if you have a low we one hitter which is high positive feedback strands you have a pretty wide range of the pure load that you can see but this range is seems to reduce as you add more and more we buy meters okay so yeah so I think we have about 10 minutes left also I only have a few slides I think I want to take the advantage to share what we are doing now or in the future using this coordinate system so for example one of the things we can answer is based on a previous study there in the in the early and browning cycles and actually for any cell cycles probably is that there is this the spatial positive feedback so many of that not only so we know that the temporal positive feedback of the silica wine is well studied so we know about but the spiritual positive feedback is if you have more active silica wine to translocate easily more easily into the nucleus and the translocation can improve more something silicate want to be turn on so that's a special positive so in theory well we know that this people can't give the spacial hysteresis and we wonder if this property in basically by compartment of the of these molecules isolate at a specific location and also help to improve the accuracy of the temporal property so the boom in our lab is using optogenetics trying to answer this question so another thing we can study using the system is related to cell size also our preliminary data shows that the size matters actually if we Hyun the oscillator sorry if you returned the size of the droplets that seems to affect the oscillator behavior I also know that the size also is important parameters in the early embryo development so that's another thing we can study and finally if we add a different amount of the DNA into our droplet system we can tune the DNA content and we can also tune the nuclei to settle Tonica ratio in the volume and that is important for the mid plus row transition which is the first developmental stage of the embryos so we hope to use our system to take - to study this system ok so and then yeah so this is very quick also I think I talked a lot about the single oscillator behavior but if we imagine that we can put many oscillators you know excitable media that can allows for the wave propagation to be generated according to I did see you here so right away is not showing but that's okay on the this was just a target a wave of the South Division of the Triple A embryo from the left to the right so this is important about a logical system you see the spiral wave and hugging the wave and many other kinds of wave you find magic but this is not unique to the biology system actually way back you you have this easy wave chemistry so so additionally we know that multiple different oscillators can cold cold regulate the same process and also multiple raters can stay in one specific myself to control the behavior of the self and indeed in the simple sign of bacterial we found out on circadian clock can control the cell division cycles to tell at which time of the day in the cell can divide so we want to use learn to focus on these directions on the one direction we have is this so basically we know the trigger wave is understood as efficient a way for communicating over a long range and the classical example is the action potential that's propagating from one side of the neurons and when the distance is long just by a simple molecule T future is simply not going to work we have to have some kind of trigger wave mechanism and the might audio trigger wave was first discovered in Jim Pharaohs lab and they use this a cell-free system and we adapted the system to our study so in this system we basically generate a two different wave propagation behavior why is just at the uniformly distributed acidic a1 oscillators so in this case we don't encapsulate in the droplet we allow them to share in a same set of sonica area and in another we can add a DNA to generate this single nuclei so on the left here I recorded a simple biochemical wave on the right here we call it as a nuclear wave and to our surprise is for both one dimension and to dementia it seems that the alchemical wave is much faster than the nuclear wave so we wonder maybe that's because some of the heterogeneity happening here so we know that I was sitting a while when it's activated it translocated into the nuclei so then essentially you can be a barrier for the communication among the nearby wave because it cannot freely diffusing any more and then only after nuclear mode or breakdown you can start to communicate so we think maybe this way behavior is fundamentally different than behavior so owner and I'm in jail are studying this question so the whole other area of the lab it's actually related to the zebrafish type embryos and also a bit more recently I started tissues and single cells so there are interesting so metal Genesis it has this process well first of all it's it's a well conserved for all the vertebrates so it's a periodic formation of the somites which is the precursor of the body segments for over the brace from zebrafish to our human and so there are two clocks control the same process why is the sedimentation clock which seems to coordinate with the soma deformation period and segmentation croaking existing in each single cell or in the priests america Macedon region another Club is the cell circle because if you have this elongation of the fish they have to basically proliferating to generate more and more cells and so one of the questions that we are interested is how these two clocks are coupled together to coordinate to make this very precise pattern formation so additionally we know that the frequency of the oscillator seems to slow down from posterior to anterior and the actual reason for that is not no yet um but one review paper here basically shows out the the mechanical property of this KSM region also varied from posterior to anterior basically the cells at the posterior are more mobile and it also has more tissue rigidity oh sorry less tissue rigidity and the saw density is also lower comparing to the Imperial so then we wonder if mechanical signal count of thirteen this biochemical automation so in collaboration with champion Foods lab from mechanical engineering so we're we're trying to understand this but isolates the single cells and put it on the micro post where we can change the surface rigidity and iteratively and also can stretch the cells we also change the density which in this case there is a 30 in Mouse they they put cells out different density and they found out the higher of the density cells coordinate and seems to allow the better oscillations I want to stop here thank everyone in the lab and so I'm highlighting here are the students and both dogs are working on the projects that I introduced and most Simone and the year has initially developed this microfluidic Joplin system for developing this artificial cells and engineering over collaborate for two projects my particle wave project and also the the mid Palazzo cognition project I share an agenda and among collaborator for the true nobility project and she also leads for the energy to another project Daniel and Patrick also involved in these projects and I want to thank my collaborators and Colleen's I know it's a kind of alone so but I'm happy to take any questions if you have any [Applause] any questions really is this yes I'm sorry yeah um thank you for the excellent talk so I have some question about the nucleus so you in the first few slides you showed us some video on the nuclear formation and disassembly so um how is the morphology of the nuclear is determined is that membrane bound or is it like just a job with formation and then when you talk about the nuclear waves when you add the DNA to form the host in clear wave it seems that the nucleus in that case is pretty homogeneous in size so why is that compared to the UM the different morphology of the nuclear at the first few slides maybe to our seven Oh question first is so I don't think it's a NASA we don't see it like a statistically the top later case has less uniform you know nuclei shape and size and then the the cube case maybe I mean the students over there can correct me but it's it's really less controlled by us so some in some statistical case you have some where the shape of the nucleus I guess what you are talking about is this one the ones here eventually they also crazily rotating which we still don't know they say well this is a really largely unknown thing for us as well for the for the two bouquets on I see really sometimes we also see a nuclear aggregate but it's yeah it's hard to say so what kind of DNA did you add into it to form the nuclear wave so this one is a sperm DNA isolated from the Xenopus thank you any other questions Eric yeah hi thank you for your talk so you identified this correlation between ATP concentration and the amplitude of your oscillation I was wondering if you had any sort of insight into the biological reason as to why that relationship exists ATV oscillation and what the ATP levels and the amplitude of your oscillation well so the the reporter we have is the second area it's a no-face substrate so it basically is a sensing ATP so so this one so the well ATP is a high it whoa it's a history of because I like this basically well target this securing your for degradation so that means if you have low ATP your your MRA obvious accurate keep translating your e-learning interface only when your ATP turns on it starts with you great so that's why if you have lower ATP you will have higher amplitude I think there was one more yeah maybe we can pass the night vacuum sorry I missed a majority of your attack but I have a question regarding this this auscultation have you does it affect the secretion function of the cell or you are not measuring any this is a this is a watering oil in motion oh yeah I don't know we would talk about secreting into the internal environment yeah in our current phase but it's not even like they put a bilayer it's just a single green ocean and yeah but I know I mean for example Ellen Leo's loud they try to generate this earlier and they seem to they are interesting in some ion channels okay I thought my thank you any other thoughts if not let's think John [Applause]
