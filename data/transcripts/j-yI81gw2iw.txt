can we stand up I feel great thank you very much mercy and Adam I'm very glad to be here to present her around their terminology but you know we know here today it's a special day like I'm the first time to present that you in front or 4 that's 12 you and I know many people are watching online yeah he's two-faced the co-leader outbreak situation so everyone can understand but anyway I feel like I'm the first around right okay so today I'm going to talk about her actually I'm going to have chameleon Wireless as my example so because my lab is doing some collaborative work the title of my contagions on to any motorist for expensable oncology environment so we called X therapy those like a extensible markup language personnel now we have x LD browsing very annotate of felonies myself yeah yeah the CC and B yes in the city Amy's father of dcmp for so many years starting when I joined Michigan for 7:05 my primary promise means our universe for never any more medicine and I also had shown a commentary in the Department of Microbiology and immunology told my my pleasure degrees actually when any medicine I was a veterinarian virtually for a couple years and then tonight either some massive research from some virus some racial bias that as we know the the fast in the stars co2 by which a court is took over the 19 they also are virtual virus so yeah we do find some commonality and then yeah I came to the states 1996 idea Sam don't look if these researchers focus your own legacy environment is a paraphilia it's not a virus it's called up booster doses the which can cause a human problem and the animal problem then said I had on my master degree in computer science yeah after my PhD and I work at it's a Virginia are paying for America's Institute for three years until I came to here thirty into Virginia applying for Medicine Institute virtually everywhere the bouncing no color no chemo no disparity information markup language so actually we can conquer the pilots as viruses bacteria so anyway no I'm no quitter fit into the audibly because this is what I study a long time but actually more delight in hearing sciences so I'm going to introduce what is oncology then how ontology can be used for literally for studying for example King the precision medicine or study coronavirus infinite aziz and then i will say okay the on toy is good then we need a good interoperable ontology to support this kind of disease analysis as many other things and say anything knows it to support a data fairness right but when a firm uses no more nowit's a recent movement initiative to make the data like a findable fi ND interrupt accessible useful sometimes is but anyway so in that way archaea oncology is a key to the whole bit of furnace concern to study tour there are theories we need your interoperable oncology but only oncology and it's how we do interoperable apology then we have in Saudi and we have to us but this how everything comes together yeah just give some background I think that you know this can't be wrong for for the audience here are buying tinnitus probably is a churro right so we say okay so be a day hike nice with Malaga where we've here and people sometimes that use a three-week modal poorly mother or three murders the four movies basically raw deal variety or recipe in the world velocity and velocity so it's a podium bother to give them the aspects of the data so companies have a ties very heterogeneous and definitely not easy right so as a Nobel Prize winner to meet Brenda said we are now joining in a sea of data are there no open we could no no results no knowledge so we are filthy for knowledge how can we do it how can we could wrong this kind of messy is a big a data to knowledge right there's a pH challenge so just give some example I got for them Berea will to hospitals so they haven't data base right picking the data you can see this is the patient in Paris it is a code it is named what you can even see okay I have to sing name by the in Tiffany language you can see it's not easy you know like for example a lot of synonyms like iron deficiency anemia and sit over a meal in India they basically mean the same thing that you can see if your name right and they even have different code of course they're Chinese that even as well so if you have asked question I got how many patients in here even just six people here know who have anemia no easier I know yeah what you see who have anemia is basically anemia is what I were a higher level because there are similar anemia there are more like total classes that subset of anemia and send anemia defendant until the mental issues here is just I got an example so in your hospital or your biometric data Thomas analysis is a city though it's like different inner resources how to achieve their sharing and a high probability and so how you can do like a difference right who have anemia so it's a simple human influencing you can need to make sure you know which rice anemia right that's me it's a bit I'm gonna this is me which equals anemia but see I'm gonna go some class early and need anemia so often to kind of things no can be quite a challenging so here again I got portability analysis often you see you know 80% of data they are no focus on I mean time we realize your data is more like the data integration part so we argue you know like that oncology is a major foundation for the integration yes so that premise is findable accessible interoperable and reusable of course Plessy interoperable I want to emphasize the in table power is a key here so I also want to say that our know the left-wing party hi a lot the richest foundation for the I so just kill right besides but let's say we had were sound crazy like oh no you have to intuit VI machine that robot oh I'm a human I'm a Sikh I got a kind of Kobe the 19 or TP or whatever but how should I do and yes just so when you talk about a robot right so to me prepares a very intelligent write the words issue they should understand you right mr. ronnson oh my god human right look at human are you had kind of an echo there maybe TB tuberculosis or virus what is he right that is virus so it's like it's not only for me knees say all right I know you but there no no more right they I will say okay I'm a human and the guy was a monkey right the real person kind of a quickly understand the relation or difference similarity between me and Zaza wa right so what's the difference between human and the monkey so this is how our artificial intelligence to take care of right so I mean in this case so to keep about a is either a I should know the meaning of who was right the net nations among the was they didn't make sense right so we understate the I but here I want to argue like the oncology will become the basis of V I so the ladies oncology the ultra means being needs to develop the oncology basically some more like the French of science study be anarchy but illusionism Allegra philosophy by God know what he says a nature of me or the universe or everything but now when come true ite theater though mr. can be defined as easily so oncology is a human and the computer incur treatable representation of enmities eliminations among entities in a specific domain like it sees or universe so you hear the keywords is computer should understand like you actually understand right come across understand anything and the inter it's a formal logic orientation so here so just looking for the other question I gave earlier I see I'm I gotta seek no I better to you right it's money enough right this assumes as a super no but she doesn't know anything well if it's all I know you I know what do you mean here so William you see Sir the couid nineteen is crucified to buy this right this is the virus and then yeah you have human right so yes the color 1903 can you finish human and the fact I got my lamb probably has some issues but yeah so it's a kind of a magical location can be the lung and lungs part of a human so to me so it's the what's the similarity or what's the difference between human and then they're survivors right tortilla yeah more like or beneath it or virus particularly is another occasion but it's more like in between organism and in an organism so why does definitely can notice the right with other say alright bye-bye us they can you tell if they can replicate it so yeah even something like this if you give this right we can quote is where's ontology right don't include oncologist definition so if you P with this Iran to AI the in red becomes smarter than before because nori a is is more than as I'm a human know or eager disease right has no fishing between you and the disease and in the course of disease everything can be in together so so if we can shoot into the AI robot into something like a ontology or you can give me the name maybe knowledge graph or some other name so that becomes matter so so basically the way but you can see along include two major branches so one prevention is machine learning right another branch is knowledge representation and the knowledge a kind of reasoning the oncology basically is more like a third promote rehabilitation of Neurology so is a key part over yet so if we look for teeth in there Allah tests parrots or different technologies or primitive Sciences you know you can you can find it easier so the oncology is up here the technology is called all our means the web ontology language what the change in your did you should say double oh it's just--see okay oh it's more like anymore the tooth technology contain the other side it's issued more like that the metas order was a penalty or the science so basically you have additionally the service consumer Camilleri denoting immortal salami and oncology is more like a mother than potentially is like a new use advanced technology also you confer software I some cost the rest of cost in the North High in more money 13 Weber oncology yeah but however symmetrical proficient is magic better so you have a better kind of a reasoning power in the machine can understand logic and cause them more so that is that's very important so let's say we have Excel table so you have a column you have rows right so it's not additionally he say okay I have defender the Ichiro is at current quality that we had discussion but the higher right now is like the relations among front probably is not defined don't worry can be further variations among different colors the monkeys and the rows definite give me your most Americas to pull up more at Advanced Study so yeah so basically roughly can see ontology equals will control the vocabulary plus relation or somatic us this is just a rough life at reset definition earlier so yeah if you to teen special nurses but most likely you are going to use the Chi oncology right the gene ontology was a developer is in the last century the rain coming up people at that time there were several or many organisms genomes are sequenced by human mouse plant fish and area so 20 knows but genes it's so hard to imitate if you just need magic what happens at time so how do we imitate and then eventually they say oh you know I should work with you together with your human your mouse but you are working on zebrafish so we should work together to determine join forces to generate such human ecology today one can be used to enter their definite genes it is certainly steam products P components where it's like a molecular machine palácio process in the third component but just at ease and if he/she is so powerful that people are using the old Heinz morality for a punch or not so some people are wondering oh we should have ontology for many other things I go for your ideal like sing oncology I did yeah between zucchini tear line and mercy right and the nonfluent Sakura virus the virus it is Authority but anyway so we can use the oncology not only gene products but ABC so this kind of idea okay so this is a ton better ontology so hopefully you have some tasty understanding or maybe you already have your mind questions any questions no okay I'm going to the second one as a whole so yeah I'm going to kind of put on my demo kind of interviewing the inside the technology so I'm going to have a thermos the rinds of chili tissue analyst ontology 30 so ontology actually is 13 big is one essential component of it's a circle k PMP the Cheney position medicine project which has been funded by NIH and in world there are like a more than 20 communities so we just Tammy had a paper got a free burger view back so it's in the nature nature review Authority is the one with the purse that journals in the field yeah though is very exciting for us and say I'm talking about let's title this is a career and I was infinity sees ontology so no one I just initiated three the poly one month ago so because we would know we had this curve as initially he operated in China and now can go to Barnard everywhere in the yesterday's WTO condensate it would be like a pandemic like everywhere it's coming is emerging the really you can imagine the curve is right the data associated with the outbreak can imagine a fitting includes a bigger they are category right that's a I had Virginia's data they have big already data whether that's unfortunately in the people and you take the disease the virus and the human it's a lot the ontology so very nice it's very good a feat to analyze them so you can see the foreign ecology smell like are can be used as the modeler patronization metadata imitation but I'm usable for knowledge presentation but just imagine our computer can become smarter right tent and police on us because memory it's more informations than us there's a kick but only memorizes the current they can memorize the relations among turns the middle one is a cos level right but they're also to the instance level data so that there are any assumption activities like an ontology you know it could become smarter otherwise it's more like a I tell people I say I'm a human oh you're a human don't know what it was different in human in the monkey but then you have an ontology chanceo women oh yeah you can you can sync wisely you can already Canada later fire or something which Stefan is quite different if long brown monkey but anyway so let's see how food and ok well let's see if you let me do the oncology like I say 40 I just thing we hear what you're playing like 999 so good notes airplane right so there's a billion company opening though to message okay I'm just going to three the start of France crush well start from scratch can be no subscribe don't square you can be like okay you you go to mine some kind of iron like and sighs rounds at in4 kind of flown to do much jr. but if it is not aware they do right dictated by the bypass you can't buy it much you know materials if I pass once you have a passport or sometimes maybe cannot buy from anywhere then you have to build up but once you have you have passed now you just give me assemble them together right so there's like no beauty Anthony you need to design it simple you don't have to start from your materia the way the news is I got you know like for example you complete your career a virus like oncology I don't have to start to see okay I'm going to see okay clearly right I mean clear virus I don't have it will start to put up those times myself right because they are already passed here and it says run for example the NCBI telling me go to have a powder one medium one medium time keeping the coming of species right and they have all kind of for hunkers of viruses so you just the polio from them you don't you don't Jenny yourself right this is why we see we should we should push it a bypass oh you know the other part we should bypass instead of symbols yeah so then for example this is just an example I just mentioned the survivors and as a human right so basically you can use you can go to it is accordingly things don't party smile you know you go to a grocery store right or something is already coming along some big of manufacturing like s we mo wants a mask for example so you can cause you have to fight fighting right so you just see I have several people on policies that include some different oncology and then you can basically go to yeah and then bypass so let's say I'm going to occur virus oncology I'm going through the city attorney no together the types of author also know like a Corvallis French writer hungers of them and today you can go to another on course let's say the ruble on another 130 so they can see ok I can be wrong I have Tiger notes miles in the scheme so those are areas then we cut can be used for to describe the disease concern you can have disease ontology gerontology seems there and so once you pattern parts together all right with everything and a cursory for you to back up you buy the parts it's not by 3 is a 3 you just a you press them and then you can you can start with a symbol awesome together I just want to give an example like it's a career is one so it's a bit like that so any vector so me it has a bother 1 million 1 million points different all kind of species so once you have war know we have a technology I'm going to tell you because it's a tool right you to a demo real sweet Ross so the one who is called on performers those under Fela is a pretty good one so we are using the tool you basically basically can easily know and I say let's see if you want is a potential right you can see ok I'm going to know ask her for a habanero like a Clara live your day right since I was I control my program I want to put a whole branch along the NCBI California no I can actually automatically get those are the scenes out no things very easy because if you didn't have that or what do you do you copy paste so it's not easier because it's not only Iraqi but it's also a definition tsunami and the a little other teachers ID you know for each of the term cold pizza thing doesn't work from Alessi you are super Java programmer but every time he'll do it no it just seemed kind of work so so basically our tool our eyes on the fellas later on I will show something you can you can do there you can use a tool then so when I came here I said oh yeah we have the SAS code through no wishing's the packaging for the cobia 19 right so it actually belongs to the circular suburb top suburb called virus the cancer actually the SAS code this is a previous us and tell you have several yeah you have like a chemical writers you know H K you 106 43 10 L Series tickets including 9 ye those we can also cause a human coming issue but see I'm not a colonist right dose I got a code so this kinda can be is caused by them and is there some outer core virus like in ferocious bronchitis virus I think I be me so the only cost problem in chicken but not only human metella previously I got my education you marry and then marry medicine so officially I I really for three years I see a lot of it she kept chick inspired do all the disease that's terrible but anyway so so the chicken have zero issue so human health or only she I feel like that the idea just cool we don't let's see what about a poster right but you can proceeding is of course there are students to them who let me take you there also possible host like human or an interlock host the horse that means you know just that meter level right they just passed that it is no maybe from best from pet to human so we found a modern tank like animals they can all help in helping is her mentally identified to have fook to hold right the virus so interview me won't put them together and having us on the tree so today you can find all that 1910 they are all under the branch a lot of memo so it's interesting because author like Little Rock whose but I mean past is also no that's right but that is also memo so to say I'm more of a memo like human there's always the people is it about me is it ok sneak and we can be the reservoir host but there is only buying the magazine another kind of prediction there's no sort of evidence so my feelings were lucky not because because a snake is not a memo but because we can find some groupie I think the citizen this is another usage oncology where we found the recipe SME work so we found there about a 70 Jarvis there have been used that to treat her and chorus and it was some success maybe like a in Sarah or mouse motor or you we are human don't know if I gave you an Excel table co-writer with 70 chemicals you policy or what I should do we see right so actually you can align them into oncology that's not the important information for example on tragic to tell you the mechanism additions to by a librarian through to oncology initially we found that for some address there's a drug around this is we bring me the research has Emily that means of addition anxiety in heater so when you could also move to the other charity are some to have a summary of information but we present there you can quickly find oh they are in this category so you can find some pattern basically of the druggist there's a rule to kind of turn it heater no druggist and you find some pattern the way it's useful if you make any clue try to design new brothers know and which can be used it to treat her to a virus so anyway so this for this is some example to show our on first can help you to identify the virus it is a cruise and then how to deal with Travis so please listen to the rap so let's say you have virus you had with the druggist tosya Honeywell basically a small cellulite so you have to assemble them put them together when you put them together you have it to Canada make sure everything goes very real so it's called a interoperability because otherwise not only to turn right it's also relations the nation means the hierarchy and means to cross the different branches we want to make sure the interoperability you know it is good so so basically the idea aside okay I want to peel that recycle I want to use it if you study the curve iris and then how can I do so I basically say okay I'm going to bypass well I mean that kasi Saiga I'm doing the Passover virus right and thoughts of the hosts and parts of the drug okay I think the more I can do it's the biggest thing I can do to change mission facilities that's a eventually you know okay I don't have enough data because you know little data missing thanks to fine because I will say nothing examples were point ology is smaller but purely a table of chemical elements the last laces or anniversary of 150th anniversary or fermented leaves invasion of the pure table elements right the remember to developer the table in notes that was only 15 for jealous no chemical elements here the without a framework people wherever he have into the free world right and then artists hit the producing for ontology I feel it was a similar we can no biddable can ago oncology we know it could be for the elements or it can be for the disease right so you may find a little bit formation already there then you can probably into oncology you'll find information you see your product at your competition but this kinds idea you know so in the end you know like words or pillow a table key element becomes a foundation of chemistry right the employee can become a foundation or full of the disease study right so it's um kinds idea so we want to be sure and also so my data ironic here so you wanna make sure our data can be linked under may be can can be further ontology and then world or data cannot cross here that can be interoperable the Epiphany this significance of home country so so and Denali motor interoperability is key how do we do that we see okay this is the uncertainty principle in the tourist so basically people was a published quran 18 the supreme price actually not that comic idea is basically four principles the wise ontology totally used it's like okay I'm going to build my career a virus I won't even use tons I don't want to build up myself I think I start from scratch I think I'm to me real right this all the cursor me right for the presser me I can get it at it's easy I mean to serve iris or the host so I don't have to put on myself okay oh they are crappy as a carpenter the terms the branch is not easy so but you want to go up you want to do so so you didn't give the principal that's if you gave me true all right at work and Gabi you very easily to the to Peru so and they have personnel alignment the cement alignment that you can through the manually oil thing is a tool for the true defender oncology because I give in a password if you live in a part by nature in Asia already aligned together then you well maybe your child was so easy yes they are I just get in it's a prison I know we do we all fit right sometimes it doesn't feel then you have an issue and drinking hello so this the kind that you bypass right sometimes you can notify let me pass through our any company right for example you're on the Builder really so you have to put out yourself so you have to put up yourself down through the fast you want if you want you to manually then we have a recorder yeah we have true it's very that principle first we were cilantro leak attempt at it so you can have a design you can have a pattern to be designed and thank you saw a tool to do so so please buddy tell you can kind of make it the kind of airplane many socially much easier but even though it's the much easier still little time whatever effort but definitely it will be much easier concern to community a community instance ability so community effort is important because it's ontology work now you don't want to do everything as a repeater you want to basically we know like there's a community so what a developer can be used by partners right and then you can try to a charter more and more and you must sort of developer use your own ecology then you know it's more useful okay but this kind of a full principles anything yeah here again I will say all the principles that can fit into flammeus right the fish has interoperable the primavera satirically the major part of irrigation to achieve interoperability whereas she was a perfect offical efficacy intern we have a few tools here this one is not a summary or for know the truth we bet yeah we use something called ultra comfort anymore and it's the more like yeah it's a pipette it they can see on the photos from the dog on the red on the beyond the birth and cetera so basically they sing at all time because we're with America we basically see that each any material is more focused on one specific are asked right and they can put them together so we see a pitcher should turn we use too many alignment we use on the focus and then the trend we use and the problem can be useful come you use we welcome it use for the controi get some pattern usage until you can we can have on poppy yeah several tours so on the bees so it's a default server for the older foundry the other factories more it's a basically within a community not doable means open biomedical or power biological or oncology affect the geology or was the first arrive of the open function and the noise it has a father Kohanga well you know in 200 employees just something we call a reference oncology but most of our reference oncology is something today it's more like a little cozier and grab some currants and think Caroline's them maybe your own airplane or your own pathology for your own study so this Ryan smell alcohol you want computer right so it's not either let's say we want to put a quarter or a virus if this ontology you wanna say okay we need a virus the wheeler host we need a sale we need a cover girl and not me and the we to mediate all pieces puzzle pieces and so we need to assemble them right so so basically you want building your euchre elevator for oncology you want to basically in first pre design right we just go to know korabik homes from Tiffany reference oncology and say I cannot find anyone from anywhere that you need to put up with your own time though in your own annotation I can use the ontology the new tool yeah format passing plays yeah yeah is occluded to give some demo later but anyway yeah I want to emphasize it note the principal run the Episode II principal wines can reduce the you can you use is written reference ontology - no no - she smell like okay I'm a kind of really short you know you want to go to shopping for the reliable kind of your company's products the sharpie but we have reliable reliable anthologies human 4G many artists insane thesis is a femicide for con reuse is the oomphel forest line so consist d3 are basically is very easy to use I don't know let's say I can give free demo let's see here on the first right so let's say for example you choose around we have a lot we have little oncology's here so let's say you want to see what I'm going to find the author also clear virus to me right people to see the NCBI Authority so Tiger 1010 CPI organism of patient right so you can see okay I can have a human okay let's say I'm allowed to have a Samsung coder virus yes so basically you had you all really user heels let's see actually the first varieties does it mean so he's at home and this is ID so let's say I'm going to choose this one and I'm going to see I'm going to add right I'm going to add the turn but I don't know this is kind of high-level turn right I don't want to only I know this trend say I was a whole branch so let's say you want to say okay I'm going to see I'm going to know this one or the include or chuji right you can say I'm going to include oil chili really uses either I have a branch the whole branch automatically is charted alright so you can see I can help annotation you wanna say you can have our agency ins or or or annotation depending on what you want and so you can do sometimes you don't want hype or to Jean Jesse okay I don't want to have myself you wanna shoot you but you have different options you can have yes really yeah so once you do it's quite easy just to say I'm going to know get output so just wrong it you should is a fine is a quicker I so yeah so this right side you want to put your children your whole branch of here so and City Clerk you can see I'm going to I'm going to save the dink trying to say you can use the furniture this is a deep-water oncology alpha but if we want to look for the source it's modeled in Samara right it's more in Samara rdf from it or all for me these are for men so basically no you just have a few lines of code E or play yeah you get tons of things you can a lot of stuff here let's say this is Uncle Peter I can't do the policy so we have yeah this rinds for he's asking is yeah my lab has development tools and sensor on the front appears likely the most useful tool so we have a lot probably a bother compounded at least I PHS access every day here okay so let's say we have I'm just going to the CIP alright I because we put it there the IPO this is so-called Clara virus in focuses on ecology so yeah I actually always use in Toronto force to kill it's a third branch rickey desert Cora so yeah we were doing so Korea let's see I just click anyone okay because it's a if the mole either is a similar about to print Iraq sure right they can see here let's see I want to get it the real way so they're all those are most of it to other human coronaviruses they belong to this category I think it's a big high beta 1 is data this is the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus so this is the mask this is most handsome just more so sauce so you can yeah so you can see here this is a Commodore also a virus organized participator sir that belongs to difficult for terrorize these viruses yeah you can kind of look a deep rice the reliable virus right and then Clara so he's he's kind of defender if in the category so then you can actually just a couple lines by using arataura you can get a whole bunch of viruses that's like oh I'm it's easy not you are you want to build up you want to something we're actually putting a lot of effort between knowledge so we want to make sure we get all the pieces and we're symbols and fertilizer we make it easier and it can be very useful because you know it's a basis for a lot of corollary study so he the Canada define a standard they not only said I right he gave me knowledge so for somebody tells you this thing we even have a sauce we have most and there we have a son virus to the only no no no course the some colonists right code so but are they simulated difference they alternated belong to different the branch they belong to keepin the branch of the suitor right so they may go to not be in beta they may be in alpha so they can be in alpha or they can be in Delta so ticking they can be in different places and then you can see oh maybe the different branches maybe it's the cause why they are identical or they are so kind of transmission kind of a power right so this is more about the layers palette you can go same thing with host you see oh yeah there are all memos or even pretty there may be some new damn memo that can be the reservoir right and we can do before the chemical you can be a druggist is all all the choices that belong to some category maybe we can change in vendor sound or Changu and repurposed some drivers for the purpose of treating caroico b19 yeah just got the right idea okay I just want to create their Montfort's a hard-on for focus he somebody is some easier Saiga you know so this is in this example is the human this is a eukaryote Isis or you today some more other the eukaryotes right and then human surprisingly brown eukaryota figure it out to human or to Mouse in between there are about 30 layers in between you know definitely sometimes you want to get all the layers because you want to know all the detail sometimes for some purposes you may say oh I don't care that's gay with me yep for me they all belong to eukaryotes adds up your uncle Islands just enough so the tours on the phone who actually then that you choose which of which you choose to sum over she actually can tell you realize that everything is nice no Layla this aligns to the computer intermediate layer so what are the new since I got you know if I have human yet in the mouse actually I do have some layer you don't get relatives with those things but I'm going to push it in first I got the mouse and the red it's uncommon to notice the common ancestor here you nearly need right and the newly and the human can have some lower stir and set up here so they basically just I have some mechanism for some other reason to know get a little tougher you need butter you too simple or to calm Canada so basically the tour is one of the most least useful for now is to kind of let you know to go through a people ontology and grab no dancing like I want to buy some parts you need to buy every single now I just say I want to buy some parts so and then you can assemble you can put this one into your your own policy so just cut about the principle one of Saudi prince or two is alignment along who will just make this import because the the line mean that we can open to and the manually or we can kind of the tool class I'm crazy for you to do some alignment decoding or you can basically have some our tour so we have under for us on the person is not rule is either you can use Excel format as far as input until this the sweet SOT and the street is based on with exam pattern that is empathy so you have Excel fire you have no turns you know what you don't want to do that at the turns to encourage it manually so let us see you want to see okay it's okay by us study so we have you see I'm going to have a lot of kind of serial type right I want I want to understand whether you probably doesn't have a lot you know it's kind of tedious to edit manually so you can put in who in a Cell fire and it's not a pattern and they use the Paycheck you can automatically so basically smell the hot because automatically you know is changing your answer fire into oncology but you do have the Cody you don't have to kinda go manually for the year so it's a natural so that can be quite nicely useful for you to do the new turns right so you have returned we use on the fullest new thank you on the red and then you put them together right in now it's a you become then you have a core virus it sees ontology yeah this for communities you turns ability very easy you want to work together busy a community yeah and the way here is a mother family the winner kind of for priests post you have a deep interns I care more wonderful for us on the way I feel a quicker one and then I showed it on for under P for kind of visualization and yeah so basically the essence of the be so cruel it's very simple because no we don't have a high on you kills I'm better on but I just want to give you some flavor of how things can be and today is no because it's a cur virus may give you some idea right so it's just too small because initiated tell me some bigger project that I can give me a couple minutes to tell you ontology can be used to support that position nursing Toria sister Qing Yi precision medicine president it has more than 20 varieties doesn't imagine like you patience or Kingi tissue right obviously because data from anywhere and time different the universities want to organize and send no kidding me what is worth putting a study right so they can probably let me say I have here so you have clinical data you have metadata episode data they can be from different issues doing the data so how come so since put together right it is really not easy just imagine it's not easy don't like this so you have only the stitching spending data imaging data it holds our specimen data pencil you can have a long to do clinical data you can have your data how you can post data together into a very intricate analysis so the strategy we have is like okay welcome to caretaker from every real inherited halide and then we are going to build up we can clean up with the Holly can make something called a knowledge environment and so this on the environment now we can do all kind of believe the nurses but also do you know the rule tell you see oh yeah I don't care I don't money right feel private I can hire people to do the manually it is it probably will never work out so you need to cheer for the kind of organized data you know biggest and ice data and you need to care for the kind of girl fine but we which is robust and also you don't want to attest it okay I just threw a PNP see he says it because using the same piece of paper right but it's a mess around maybe Europe he and his sons in KP right cause you're cool then China has run and it so many seasoned things as its associated to here well then holiday had come up in Turkey sheer the Lucia data that he's a huge that is why we said that we can use on priority know because oncology is the sheer that is surely criminology and he has a shield oil can go to America's and a high they'll go but understanding you better the ontology is a key for the whole and mikay P&P project yes it will the nothing example though because for the Corvallis I tell you or why else in the first job right I look for the PMP but the commute between as employee that we usually have more we have G we have choose a person we have a phenotype we have we have cell line we have a tissue we have altered actually so so you can actually get loved ones don't even oncology however yourself you know because it's like that you say okay I have all the parts for my airplane get up can you pass fly you know you have a present together consume really fly Wow wait okay you can say airplane fly safely no efficient right so yeah please happy prepares you have to build up your your karma because you have to cure for the demon together so you know this is just a running example I mean hello just a life sentence I say tablet here on in other side yes absolutely G that means chronic disease no it's just a one simple conclusion of what people or a few people's there's just a simple one actually you have it immortal thing very carefully you know at the ranch me too so thank be constantly powerful because it's only one right you can help hide years of Jen doing this know each of each gene is worth that in some type of sales in some organ is some part with some field type the ones you energy is not only wine smart network and hierarchical and horizontal and vertical beam other work that I do so initially concluded over analysis you can mediate for the few lines well of course you say instead you need a program those tobacco the Sebago is not a sequel or for my sequel right so mission therapies these lines to create ontology so you can control you smell a thing is our idea so arguably is triples right idealist Chico you can put it sorry effort you can put ontology into a triple store right and then you can acknowledge them so exactly so the great synapses America's a few similar though uncross the people also available I got tours they can put it a star called depend so and then the common user didn't even near know oncology don't even know in other some you don't even know ideas so they can still use it but overseas can be under on the ground support no kind of data integration sherry and the cross different domain analysis yeah I think that's for that's it so yeah so the people is proposed by Mike here in Mecca Marika and there's also any motorist although motorists what about that you might let the real a startling yes and we have videos a foggy in the Eternity founded by Jack a PMP project so to P is Matias cristela even our University and the honor collide for the project and the previous were actually we also work on several arts of faculty members including grand easy P Roman so I go no I'm not I was called a writer for zerah zerah no silly you know student case Dylan in the front I'm so brownie she was you know major divisor he's a committee member so so we let say we team up the CLA ontology and also for worked on some colorful adverse events those are some qualities actually also he might be using the similar idea give me not close at that time we can record like a salty right just a lot know two years ago we feel like we have so many on very much horse got confused what's what right then say we say let's just give it a way to put them together so we can idea to help even if our machines that we call center anymore I mean because I'm else I will be presupposed in there they have given purpose but we can use all of them then you can make a poodle ontology easily and you can apply the four different applications so yeah that's all I have for now okay thank you any questions no questions this is fine I mean support I mean I think it's like a round club thank you okay
