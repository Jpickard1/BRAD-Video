read the paper it's a beautiful article and so please welcome dr. Tara Patterson as he leads us through his his thoughts regarding the 4d genome in invivo four steps towards a CRISPR toolkit thank you so much for coming thanks it's a real honor to be here this is a extraordinary thing that happens in your career when you get to be 73 you realize that there are some very wonderful places in the world of academic science and medicine that you've never been to and I am ashamed to say that this is my first visit to the University of Michigan and I hope it will not be my last because I've been having just such a great great day I'd like to make two caveats the first is that the host department is one relating to bioinformatics I can tell you this is the subject of which I know absolutely nothing and therefore if any of you have questions about bioinformatics that's behind this work I hope you will forgive me to defer them to emails from members of my laboratory that could flood in like an avalanche at midnight when I get home the other is that this is the first seminar on this work that we had presented we presented this month ago at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory so this is very much a progress report and this does not have perhaps the final formalism of a Cinderella biology story that you might have hoped for so the functional organization of the cell nucleus and the folded state of the genome and its dynamics in space and time is actually a long-standing problem in the field of cell biology and gene expression and therefore molecular biology it's just been rechristened with a name the 4d nucleo we didn't do that and IH did that through an initiative that was announced a few weeks ago it simply means that there's a desire on the part of your former colleague Francis Collins to get those of us who are slightly shocked born cell biologists of the to get really engaged in mapping out at some granular detail it's dynamic functions as a tapestry of genome low sigh and their dynamics as a function of space and time so in that regard we find ourselves very happy to have seen that RFP because we've been working on this now for a number of years trying to localize genes in live cells you all know that it's possible to fix cells and carry out nucleic acid hybridization in situ in a method that was developed by Joseph gall and then at BL University in 1968 and subsequently fine we find by others that's a remarkable technique and one that has given us a great deal of insight into the static situation in the cell nucleus with regard to the location of various genes or also the location of various RNAs because one could also the RNA fish as well as DNA fish three years ago in my laboratory we decided that although we were working on many other projects that were going quite well we would like to think about doing gene localization and live cells and Hana meme on my laboratory and I apologize without having an acknowledgment slide but this is the first seminar I've given on this and I forgot to make one but anima is the second is one of the two not second one of the two most talented postdocs of the fifty-five that I've had and he has innovated this work to such a degree that I am not even allowing myself to be named on the patent that is being filed by my institution he really innovated this completely on his own his work has also been supported strongly by another postdoc in my laboratory Pablo arrays be Tierra's and has benefitted from an extraordinary bioinformatics collaboration at the University of Central Florida laboratory of xiao jie zhang and another collaborator at the University of Massachusetts Medical School Scott wolf the first part of this talk is going to be on work that has been published and that deals with the use of transcription activator like effectors or tails to label chromosomal osai in live cells you've probably all heard of talents which are tails that have a nucleus attached to them and have been used in gene editing and actually talons were the second chapter of the gene editing field the first being zinc finger nucleases however if you take the nuclease domain off of a tail and i'll tell you in a moment what a tail is you can create a molecule that will label sequences of DNA tails are transcription activator like elements in the sense that they are designed by protein chemistry to resemble highly specific DNA binding recognition sites and transcriptional activator factors they have evolved in evolution to read specific DNA sequences in the double helix and in fact one of the reasons that we were very encouraged that we could use tails to label DNA sequences in live cells is because there is no need for denaturation of a DNA as there is in pixel fluorescence in situ hybridization these tails comprise of repeating arrays of amino acids sometimes 13 to 14 amino acids in a row that are then repeated over a couple of times to by specific sequences and in this starting slide of the seminar we show a tail that's been designed to recognize the telomeric repeat at the end of human chromosomes the tail can be designed as an amino acid sequence that repeats on either to read this side of the Strand and the minor groove or this side of the teal america cleave in a major groove and then of course each of these can be labeled with your favorite color these are expressed as plasmids all the plasmids and all the constructs that I'm going to show you here are an ad gene and I'm available we've had over 300 requests and a few months since this paper was published and I guess for thought we should put the lights kind of like halfway down halfway down means hey Mel and what would you say halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit it's not at the bottom it's not at the top but it is the stair I always stop I think that was Christopher Robin but there is a luminosity level which is just gracefully positioned so that it allows the speaker to see those who are asleep and does not get further induced sleep in others who are not asleep so after expression for 12 to 20 hours in human youtube osteosarcoma cells one can see that the tale labeling of discrete sites either in the in the venous color or the cherry color and here is the overlay this doesn't say very much to you he's lighting up some spots the question becomes is there specificity so in this experiment we have combined the tail Lyde cell labeling in the upper row with post live cell labeling with immunostaining in the middle row so these are live cells that are being imaged with the telomere tail and this is cells that have been fixed and stained with an antibody to a sheltering protein that sits on the teal america feed called truth 2 and this is an experiment in which the cell has been labeled by the tail in the live state and then fixed an image to show you that the tail that we designed to bind the telomeres lights up fo side that are entirely coincident with the sites of immunostaining for the telomeres specific protein I think for some of this we might even want a little less light I say that at my own list thank you Alex so is also possible to carry out other tail designs so here in the upper row is a tail that we designed for not the centromere the centromere is an ugly beast in the human genome in fact it was one of the many repeated sequences that was never in the original human sequence draft with a tail designed to recognize a Perry central marek region so we call this a pan centum Eric crow because it's recognizing a DNA sequence it's adjacent to the centromeres of all the chromosomes and here is a in m cherry red tea a teal a tail designed to a teal inner this gets a little bit tongue twisting this is a tail for a telomere and you can see that there is a very interesting set of patterns these of course do not overlap they shouldn't because the centromere is in some internal site in each chromosome and the telomeres are at the ends well that makes sense in fact if you think about it you actually can use this as a yardstick to measure certain distances of interest more compellingly we happen to be able to generate through a collaboration with Karen Riga in the UC Santa Cruz genome Center in the Howser group probe tail probes that were specific for Perry central Merrick sequences on chromosomes 18 or 15 so in these two cases this tail is binding only to the centromeres of chromosome 18 and of course the reason you see more than two is because this is perhaps a g2 cell but also this is a aneuploid cell this is a similar one that we designed for a Perry central synth American sequence around the centromeres eye chromosome 15 along with the telomere probes here one can measure the distance between a specific chromosome centromere and the telomeres and this begins to give us a yardstick for assessing how the many many mega bases of DNA on the linear physical map of a particular chromosome are actually conformed into a compressed distance in the in the intact live cell again remember this is all live cells nothing dead these are human you to RLS cells the same ones we had before yes we haven't done the ecology we encounter and now there's always the possibility that in one particular chromosome this sequence is not available to a tail I was very dogmatic when I said tails can bind double-stranded DNA that's absolutely true but there is the possibility that certain sequences are covered there might even been in regions and no stealing arrows that are covered now and things get a little clearer when we go to diploid cells this is just to show you and I would just would ask you to remember this when I get to the CRISPR part the CRISPR part of the story the crispy part is that you can do these tail labelings in any color you want there are now 18 fluorescent proteins the spectral bandwidth is extremely good the microscopy companies have not caught up any of you do this you know that you cannot get filter sets that will filter discriminately between blue and teal for example it's very very hard to do and so what we do is we simply you know we call this one we call yeah Alex you were right this is really take some practice we call this teal because this fluorescent protein is teal or us and protein this is cyan but we image them in the same Channel and that's sort of how they look up so we can make a polychromatic palette of colors and do multi labeling multi color labeling I keep walking over here think I have to advance the slide over there now to get more specific one of the things that we got very interested in is when we got these telomere tails was looking at cells that have different lengths of telomeres you guys all know there's a whole Gestalt about telomeres and cancer it's a dogma but I think it's been a little bit overdone frankly but anyway in this experiment what we've done is we've used a variety of cells these are the these are the human you 2os cells that I've been talking about they are highly aneuploid here are HeLa cells also highly aneuploid two different strains telomere length of new cells is is about 70 kilobases in these cells is about ten kilobases in these HeLa cells is about thirty kilobases here's a diploid cell line I am our 90s in which the telomeres are very much shorter about three to five and this is human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line in which the telomeres are extremely short maybe one to two kilobases and while we do not claim we do not claim to have a quantitative assay for telomere length as you have with a molecular assay such as trap assays where you use the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase to make a product there is a very nice correlation between the known telomere average lengths in these cell lines and the brightness of the signals that we see we decided that it would be possible to perhaps do a tricky experiment of mixing those two HeLa cell lines so we labeled one of those HeLa cell lines with a DNA dye that is blue Dappy and we label the other HeLa cell line that has the longer telomeres with a DNA specific dye that is red and then we mix them together and we image them and that's shown in the bottom but what is more interesting is and again remember these are live cells is you can go to your fax Center and when you go to your fax Center and in our institution and I'm sure you do here we have faxes and it's it's sort live cells and not only this is to me unbelievable they not only image live cells and sort them but they actually get it they give you a recorded image now those cells as they fly through that aperture around they've been trypsin eyes off the cover glasses are the plates of the cells and so you don't have the high quality microscopic resolution of the nucleus and the chromatin that you in the conventional experiments in our laboratory and yet you are able to extract a lot of information even from those round cell images I'm not going to go through this in detail it's much too complicated I really want to get to the new unpublished work but you obviously get a number of pieces of information out of this first of all with either the bappy or the red dye you get you get cell cycle information that's standard but secondly with detail specific probes labeled in green or teal you get binning of populations that you can then extract out and you can see that there is heterogeneity and I haven't been able to convince you because I didn't set this up right but this analysis is being done on a mixed population of those two HeLa cell lines that carry different telander likes each of which is labeled with a DNA dye that's either red either blue or red I think you can see when I said Halima is a very created investigator when he said who's gonna mix the selves is it supposed to mix oh that's not good I mean that's the low subterranean reptilian level of my intelligence relative to where he was thinking which is one up there and this is just the kind of image data that you get I really don't we have been now collaborating with some of our oncology colleagues who are extremely excited by this because it turns out and I'll maybe just take a moment here to turn the slide off and say that all of that work is live cells transient expression of these various plasmids for tails hang me ma one day came in the office and he said you know you don't have to denature the DNA a B and I said yeah why why are you telling me that because that's what you that's why you did this and he said but you know I just made some recombinant tails in e.coli as promptings with fluorescent proteins and what he had done this sneaky guy he had fixed themselves and he'd made up a buffer and he put his recombinant tail fluorescent protein in the buffer and just let it sit on the cells and brought me pictures that were as glorious as what you see there now you might say well why are you now reverting to that day of yesteryear to use a lone ranger TV show thing why are you going back to fit cells well it took Han me ma a couple of days to make the fluorescent tail in e.coli as a recombinant protein it took him 10 minutes to do the in situ labeling in CT nucleic acid hybridization minimally takes 24 hours therefore we now believe and we've been working on this with some of our oncologists if there are keylock people that it would be possible to take a sample of cells a fine needle biopsy or a suspension of blood cells and within five minutes give a clinician and report on the number of copies of chromosome 9 or the number the length of telomeres and so forth based on a thick cell assay that resembles in secu nucleic acid hybridization but is based on this technology so there there's a lot of new things that we're thinking of doing this keyboard has W&B in different places there we go there's nothing because the the cell the cell is dead the cell is cell is dead you're doing in situ hybridization but you're doing it in under condition where you don't have to do Nate DNA because the tale never wants to buy single-stranded it can't buy a single strand of DNA this is part of the patent good we filed a year ago and of course it's been only a year so of course we haven't heard anything from the pad guys now I want to and then of course you can I our our fax center also gives us data like this where they send this back and they even tell us what is the z-axis looking like in the cells that are flying through I mean the the the laser beam is oriented in such a way that it's getting a whole cell image but they can computationally extract out this kind of information and you can also again remember after the facts is sorted and you've got the data on the heterogeneity of Teeling their lengths now you've still got the cells they're still alive they've come out the under other end of the fax machine and they're still alive put in a culture and take a look at what they do you can follow them through several cell cycles that I'm not gonna go through those data so that's that's where we are now about four months ago Han we ma again came to my office he comes to my office and he says I have a new project I thought he meant he had a new project to propose no he sits down with his laptop and tells me that he has already done about one third of the work I'm going to tell you about today though this is what that's been done by him in the last four months or so so crisper this is a bacterial immunity system that was discovered over a decade ago in which there is an enzyme it is an endonuclease cast nine that is responsible for excising from the bacterial genome invasive DNA it does so in the most ingenious way you could possibly imagine it actually uses RNA transcripts made by the invading invasive DNA as a way to guide this pre-existing endonuclease to the very places where the invasive palindromic repeats have been inserted this is this is this is called CRISPR stands for four clustered regularly spaced palindromic repeats so it was not clear ten years ago that this system was anything other than an esoteric sideshow in the world of biology and I remember that several people in our RNA group Craig Mello and Victor Ambrose and the rest of us started to teach this paper in our lectures and as we were teaching we thought you know boy this is if this could be repurposed it would really be cool well of course one didn't have to wait long because the CRISPR system has been repurposed and is now the major tool for gene editing it is explosively dynamic field it's also I must tell you a very competitive field and so what Harvey has done is used CRISPR technology to label chromosomes in the same way as the tails but there are some additional twists that I'd like to share with you and this is what we this is where we are as of right now as of as of right now as of right now I'm going to tell you a little bit about how we're using CRISPR to do multicolor labeling of genomic Llosa and live cells I'm going to tell you about how we've been using it to look at disease related with Pete expansion low sigh in a number of disease situations I'm going to tell you without data about how you can use CRISPR to stall RNA polymerase on an expanded allele and the disease myotonic dystrophy and cause an accumulation of toxic RNA nuclear close I could disappear I should say by the way that if you think about it CRISPR is RNA interference it's not RNA I because it's not triggered by double-stranded RNA however it is an interference mechanism that is based on the sequence specificity of the small guide RNA transcripts going back to recognize their birthplace in the DNA and therefore it is RNA directed interference the big difference between RNA I and CRISPR is at RNA I operates at the translational level and the CRISPR operates at the transcriptional level and incidentally RNA interference I think there's no one I know he doubts that there will be a no bail for crisper and who probably will come as fast as no bells ever do Alfred Nobel you know wanted them all to be within one year and that's not possible but the CRISPR no guy will be very quick I can assure you and then most excitingly as our work on mapping individual chromosome territories with Xiao Jie Zhang we have been able to go through now all the repeated sequences in the human genome that were not well characterized in the draft sequence and that have now been mined by him and others and we have found sequences of repeats in every one of the chromosomes that is unique to that particular chromosome and we have now been able to further refine those sequences to CRISPR enablement and then finally a little bit about bar coding so the first thing is multicolor so the caste nuclease can be created as a GFP fusion or it can be fused with any other color you want and the experiments I'm gonna I don't know why the c-terminus is way over there this this is the C terminus over here I don't know why why it went over there in the labeling now remember this is a system that most people are using to edit DNA you don't want to cut the unit so in all the labeling studies we use a catalytically inactive mutant of caste 9 that has no nucleus activity so you will see the term D caste there are three well-characterized bacterial species that have CRISPR systems and they each have slightly different DNA sequence recognition motifs called Pam's I'm not gonna go through this in detail but simply to let you know that there are these three species with these three distinctive Pam recognition sequences that are related to the way the guide RNA attracts the attention of the dks 9 and so what we have done we meaning Han we and Pablo is we have designed plasmids that are expressed using the u6 promoter to create the guide RNAs the u6 promoter I'm very happy to say and very sad to say was discovered in my laboratory by Gary Conkel in 1986 and have a say because it was a very important thing that Gary did I'm sad to say because had me filed a patent and we envisioned that the u6 promoter u6 is a small nuclear RNA if we had envisioned ahead of time but the music's promoter could be used in trance to fire the transcription by Paul three of almost any small RNA you want and have correct termination I would not be here I would be out on my 150-foot yacht but we never thought of that because there was no reason to think of it and then in parallel you co transfect in any one of the three bacterial orthologs of of the cast nine the D cast nine catalytically enacted you give it a new symbol promoter you give it a nuclear localization signal and you give it the color that you want and so though this is a slide that would have been somewhat unbelievable if he had shown it to me without any data the fact is this works so we've been able to make some progress so here's a simple experiment in which cells these are you - us cells again have been allowed to express any one of the three orthologs of dks 9 labeled in red green or being fluorescent protein along with the cognate guide RNA and as you can see we get labeling of a blow Sai in all three I'm not even telling you what the particular DNA sequence is that we're targeting here is their relevant this is just sort of a demonstration of the fact that we can they can do multicolor here's an experiment in which we have deliberately used guide RNAs designed to recognize the teal America PD I want to emphasize the the D cast 9 system in any one of these three bacterial species is fairly discriminating about what sequences it will collaborate with as regards to guide RNAs however you can fool it in certain ways by mutating the dks itself or by creating Sol Pam sequences fo Pam sequences that confuse the bacterial cast 9 and the nuclease - thinking that it wants to work with this small guide RNA that it normally wouldn't want to work there this becomes relevant when you look at certain depite sequences that are all peering for example like a ggggg repeat that I'll tell you about in a moment so what you can simply see here is that expression of these two casts 9 systems allows you lips allows you to see telomeres in either color as you would predict ah and here's the merged image over here and the co alignment it is very very good it's actually quite a remarkable experiment when you think about it because on these human telomeres to bet to proteins those bacterial origin that those two learners had never seen before are being bound by those endonucleases here's just another example using different colors now it occurred to us that telomeres has been a platform for some of his work just to demonstrate feasibility but we're really interested in the whole genome and so we began to in collaboration with Xiao Jie's Zhang at the University of Central Florida look for repeated sequences that would be of two criteria one that it would be a repeated sequence that would be present only on one chromosome perhaps in many different places and perhaps at many different places in many different copy numbers but only present on one chromosome and we have now found such sequences for all twenty-three healing chromosomes including the Y which is the one that is so pathetically devoid of any intelligence or anything else second we would want to eventually have a lot of these on any given chromosome we would want to have ten families of repeats one through ten all of which are restricted to a particular chromosome but are located at many different locations and I'll come to that so a first one we chose was a sequence and chromis two sequences on chromosome nine one of which what do they do thank you one of which is a sequence that is on the long arm of chromosome nine but just beyond the centromere c9 one we call it the other of which is not labeled here is a sequence c9 two that is at the distal end of this arm in a sub telomeric region we designed cast nine for both of them labeled either red or green I realize this is confusing red and green and Express the cognate small guide RNAs in the same cells these are retinal pigment pigmented epithelial cells diploid ah so what you can see is that with em cherry the red we see two spots and with the c91 in green ec2 spots now these are not the same cells these are two different cells well that's good so we got two copies two copies these must be cells in gene one ah here's an example in which we have c 9 1 and c 9 2 in the same cell remarkably we label both and know immediately that this microscopic spatial resolution is the distance of the live cell chromosome that reflects this distance of DNA sequence on the physical map so we were quite excited by this but it was just the beginning then we decided to push this a little further this is oh I'm sorry this is just another example of this in two other colors now what we decided to do was then push down the resolution so instead of in this case taking chromosome 9 we took chromosome 13 and instead of taking a sequence down here we took a sequence way up here this is repeated sequences is unique to chromosome 13 and one array of which is located here actually this one is only located here and it's this close to the end of the chromosome where you have two T lamina designed to cast nine systems for the c-13 one in red and the telomere in green and we get labeling of both and now as predicted they are much closer together this is the microscopic need out of the physical map now of course in the cell the physical map is not a linear piece of DNA in fact we do not know exactly how the DNA is conformed at the long arm of this chromosome the teal America Lapita itself is not wrap around nuclear sounds in quite the same way but nonetheless we're quite struck by these results now in terms of disease we've been able to do some initial experiments here's an experiment with myotonic districting garage cells in myotonic dystrophy there is a repeat of CT G's in a three prime untranslated region of one allele of this inherited form of the disease in a gene that codes for a protein kinase called DM k1 we designed a caste nine small guide RNA for this repeats expansion and used it in vivo and live cells from a normal subject as well as from a patient who was a boy who had a normal length of the repeat is about sixty this boy who subsequently sees these lethal disease at 1,200 copies I want to emphasize that up till now we really are not sure of how many copies of cast nine fluorescent protein you need to have on any given repeat to get a signal but we can say from our tale work that we learned during that phase of this project that we probably need to have about 200 therefore it is not likely we will see the wild-type allele in this particular situation but that doesn't mean that we haven't got some cast 9 who else and protein on it it's just not bright enough to be seen in the microscope so here's the result for the normal fibroblast and as you see there is just a very low haze of green fluorescence so this is very compatible with what I just said you wouldn't expect to see 60 copies of the repeat however in the patient-derived fiber glass you see a single spot which is the is the mutant allele it must be the mutant allele because there's no other genomic DNA sequence basis for seeing a signal in this cell other than the expanded allele but this gave us confidence that if we had a repeat that was at least this long we could see it and as I told you I think we now are down to an estimate of about 150 to 200 repeats that we could be able to see in this work we have done another side project on the DM that I don't show data for it is the fact that using D ks9 we can stall RNA polymerase as it runs along both the mutant and wild type allele the stalling of RNA polymerase on the mutant and wild type allele allows us to do fish for foci of nuclear RNA transcripts from the mutant allele that are toxic these transcripts have such a long repeat of CTG that they form coagulated fossa in the nucleus in those foci they suck up so much of the mRNA splicing factors that you end up with a global screwing up a splicing of all transcripts and this is thought to be the pathogenic basis of this particular form of myotonic dystrophy you have a generic in addition of mRNA splicing because you've created this huge stockpile of these aberrant transcripts after we stall polity transcription with KS 9 we find that those nuclear RNA closed eyes disappear and the great majority of the cells and this is the basis of a March of Dimes grant application that we adjust invited to submit now this is in the 3-prime utr it is quite possible you can also stall transcription of the wild-type allele and get a functional protein and so there is a therapeutic interest in this possibility that the March of Dimes is quite excited about March of Dimes is quite ironic because Neil and I are we talking about the fact at Jonas Salk chose your medical school to make his announcement after the trial because Tom Francis was here so a little bit of polio connection now here's a just I'm I'm almost home today I'm almost finished yes I am almost finished here's another example so this is als and frontal temporal dementia here we have a different kind of repeat and this goes to the limitations of caste technology that I was mentioning before caste does not like Gee Gee Gee Gee Gee Gee doesn't like it at all however there are manipulations that Scott wolf our collaborator has helped us do that have been able to get to the point where we can begin to attack this repeat so in ALS there is a gene called c9 or 72 and c9 or or sanic Oba Whedon Trent is now thought to be by the neurologist the most determinative gene mutation for inherited ALS it also ironically shows up in a lot of sporadic ALS which is kind of mysterious that I'm sure I really understand that so we have used this Cass approach to attack the gggg CC repeat expansion in the human fiberglass and using our technology we've been able to identify single nuclear close eye of DNA labeling in any one of several constructions only two of which I'm showing you here now this doesn't get us very far but it's very very encouraging and we've also now recently gotten results for this for FTD as well I just did again what I live now I want to finish by getting into the real Holy Grail which is mapping chromosomes all together and the first thing we thought we would do we better check and find out if our live cell CRISPR labeling method recapitulates gene localizations and indeed chromosome localizations that have been recorded before in thick cells by fish and one of the best examples of this is the dichotomy between human chromosomes 19 and 18 chromosome 18 is a sad gene poor chromosome and chromosome 19 is a happy gene rich chromosome and Wendie bit more and other laboratories had shown some years ago that this difference in gene density is correlated with nuclear location and in the particular that the init that the relatively gene poor not gene inactive but gene poor is plenty of transcription chromosome 18 was situated at the nuclear periphery and that the more active gene which chromosome 19 was located in nuclear terior so we designed the appropriate caste 9 small guide RNA system and we were able to show very clearly that we were woops sorry very clearly that we were recapitulating the result here's chromosome 19 labeled with dk s 9 at a green fluorescent poking Ted and the suitable small guide RNA in a more interior location and here's chromosome 18 plastered up against the nuclear envelope in association probably with the nuclear lamina ah here's but that's only one example we've also now been able to go on and look at this with respect to chromosome 3 and chromosome 7 and it's very interesting that we've anticipated the literature here because chromosome 7 in these experiments is like chromosome 18 it's plastered right up against the nuclear envelope and we didn't know whether this is a positive control or negative control we don't know it and now we've learned in the last few weeks that actually chromosome 7 has this localization by FISH although for our publication we're going to have to do that ourselves since it's not appropriate to say personal communication of unpublished data not shown and here's the combined images of 3 and 7 so we're quite excited about this and then the last thing I would like all right then quickly let me say that another mapping we've been doing goes back to our long-standing interest in the nucleolus a part of the nucleus that arises from the genes for ribosomal RNA that are clustered in tandem arrays on five of the human chromosomes the Aqua Centrex uh and 13 14 15 21 and 22 and what we have been able to do is design the appropriate casts nine small guide RNA probes for the our DNA repeats and begin to look at their location now you might say why you even bothering the our DNA repeats you just said I the basis of the nucleoli I mean the nuclei are a psychological manifestation of biology namely Pete's and their transcription and the Assembly of Mason ribosomes that called nuclear the cleaner organized regions for that reason turns out only half of the our DNA that we can detect by our ks9 probes has a nucleolus vicinal localization shown in the red arrows nucleolus propinquity and the white arrows it's not near the nucleoli and it turns out that this is probably a manifestation in these live cell images of the fact that there is silencing of a lot of the our DNA in human cells and in fact there is an indication that there may even be some clinical significance to these observations in various patients so we're very excited about that and then finally let me just finish by saying that xiao jie zhang and his student Angela Nazari have now completed their complete bioinformatics mining endeavor of chromosome 9 and they have focused on the long arm of chromosome 9 and they have now been able to define a large number of repeated sequences which lie on that long arm and are not present in the short arm nor are they present in any one of the other 22 druman chromosomes they are arranged in a non-periodic array why would they be periodic they are arranged in that way we do not know whether each and every one of those repeats have enough copies that we could pick them up by caste 9 some of them might have 10 repeats I might have 50 those will miss but we already know that many of them have 200 or more and what is more there the blue ones are all the same but the red one is different and so we figure that if we now design at least several be cast nines for these repeats we'll be able to light up a large region of the chromosome and now Xiao Jie has begun to find a second family of repeats that lie all throughout that are not as many as these maybe about 12 they are lying all throughout and they are a different sequence family so we will have at least two colors for barcoding this chromosome arm and of course with 17 fluorescent proteins and our microscope can't simultaneously resolved in colors but we think it should be possible in the near future in this very fast-moving field to be able to do bar coding with chromosomes in live cells this means we can look at translocations not only as they happen in the father or the mother we can look at translocations as they are actually happening in a laboratory environment and cultured cells so with that I will simply say that where this is our current work localization and tracking of dynamics I have not had time to talk about the fact that we have a switchable system if you think about it if you're trying to optimize your CRISPR editing of a gene you first need to find the conditions where you're getting the maximum CRISPR binding our system allows that by using the D ks9 mutant that cannot cut and so we have a platform that we've designed in which large numbers of cells can be analyzed for the efficiency of D ks9 labeling of a targeted gene those are then sorted and the cells that are brightest are taken back and are subjected to a second round of a switched be cast that is catalytically active to accomplish cleavage not of the same sequence because it's don't forget it's already got the DES nine stuck to it but two marker sequences that border it that we can excite this has high speed potential and very fast turnaround and we're very excited about it well I thank you for your attention so I've got a short and a long question the first is where we're on the ribosomal gene repeats are your probes relative to the transcription unit they are in the coding region so they are in the transcribed region so by analogy they could be in the path of the polymerases oh yes that's true and it's a good point and they could be stalling the polymerase and that could cause it to move away from the CLIA lies it's an excellent point yes so the related long question is that they you always worry that when you put 200 copies of anything down on a chromosome it might change the behavior but you've got it you've got a really interesting system with which to to block transcription as you're seeing it in the ALS examples and ask does that affect the behavior of the locus by independent means have you started looking at that at all no I mean the collaborative team there has suggested that as well it's a very good point and I think that it's something we really have to do you would there's different predictions you could make but right now we're just trying to quantify the degree to which we've stalled the clients by doing RNA seek and we're doing chip also to make sure that we've got the polymer is stalled at the right place I mean should be coming up to that point and then stopping you shouldn't see transcripts beyond it and so forth that wasn't such a long it's of interest to many of us is what the variability is in the population of cells and to be able to answer some of those questions I guess the assay needs to be something that is a robust throughout self population so I'm curious about this assay in terms of you look at the wholesale population what proportion of the cells show different numbers of both I know that's a very good point well in the retinal pigmented epithelium which I would say is our best system so far because it's diploid we don't see number variation for any particular target we see two three or four but just what exactly you should see the target you're looking at probably isn't currently the two alleles are probably not concurrently replicated so that's why you see three but I think it's a very good point that we need to be careful about in general as far as the spatial concordant I can't speak to it yet because we haven't done three-dimensional coordination what I was saying it's all 2d in the sense you know eighteen is always at the nuclear periphery 19 is always a nuclear terior but is 18 always at 3 o'clock or is it sometimes at seven o'clock we haven't gotten to that geometry yet but that's something that we need to do with Z access focus I may ask he showed us an example where you had mapped these repeat elements by informatica li identified I think it was from some thirteen or wasn't well you saw only one of the chromosomes in those images do you have an idea why you're only seeing one no we see two and thumb I mean there there are cells where we see one and it cells where we see two and that one we may not have focused on far enough the thing that really excited us was see consistently only the expanded my account of dystrophy allele this may be impertinence is a little tangential but it is about the myotonic dystrophy you made the comment about I couldn't tell what was your speculate you know somebody else's speculation that the the deleterious effect might come from this generic jamming of the [Music] splice machinery if that were the case then it raises well to my mind it raises the following question how did you see that boy in the sense that that's such a generic mechanism that would seem to make a fetus unviable yeah well I think first of all that is not my speculation that's sort of a dogma that's into myotonic dystrophy feel he's in there since David Hausman and other people working on it I think the the answer must be that this is not all or not I mean after all it's not embryonic leaf though in fact it's not even early onset relatively speaking I mean that boy died when he was 13 it's like some of the diseases now that would be considered to be translational slow down I mean why would you think translational slow down wouldn't hurt you ever because you'll make the protein sooner or later but there's a number of pathologies now that yes this this patient had one of the longer the Peet's that's from the Coryell library that's the one we chose to start with but I think I think the idea is that you get mrna processing botched up enough that either qualitatively in terms of alternative splicing or kinetically in terms of just mounting the proper steady state level of message you've just created it kind of a bad situation and myotonic dystrophy has upstream and downstream effects at the neuromuscular Junction there's a there's a there's a motor neuron component of the distro 'fuck muscle post neuromuscular junction as well so you've got two different gene expression platforms also playing in this game did to do did that boy die young that's that's but I I think that's a little on the later side I think it's not like Duchene where I think the agent a little bit earlier this is not this is a little less severe than you shame which is always seen in the secretarial muscles when a little boy this cannot push himself up and that's something I think this was a little bit on the longer loop side yes it's already been done actually so about six months ago now let's see October October first isn't it okay yeah it's October well I think about six months ago the group at UCSF Jennifer Doudna John Wiseman published the paper and cell in which they were able to localize a single gene however they localized the single gene single copy gene by virtue of the fact that in one of its introns there's a repeat and and you could say we've done that with the mk1 as well a dmpk as well I think it's a very good question Michael I think what I would say by the way I'm very pleased to say that I was on Mike I was the external member of Michael's PhD thesis research Advisory Committee when he was at Lehigh University and I am so proud to see the year of doing all the great stuff he told me about it breakfast I don't think we can go too much further in sensitivity if you talk to optical engineers they'll tell you the charge-coupled device invention as the quantum efficiency that it has and that it can't have anymore just can now I don't know why they say that but that's physics the brightness of the fluorescent proteins is what it is they've been those have been tuned in evolution to create a spectral shift on the case of GFP from from from green light to blue that is important for the mating of a jellyfish so why are we just saying we could make it I wanted to be brighter I want our cameras to be more sensitive but I think we may be a little bit stuck it's a good point actually the jellyfish it's green it's blue like thinking like I'd say thank you [Applause]
