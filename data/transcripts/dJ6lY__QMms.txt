[Music] I'm still here I know but I knew I didn't lie on the falsifying [Applause] Thank You Marcy back to here it was attacked again so that's my sub money mr. cuddlebuns I'm here my markers bad and today I'm going to talk about a method with developing without that these are absolute big transcription factor binding from a taxi so I want to start binding or see why we should be interested in precision factor binding in the first place so we know that special in the case of the majority of the bands that we detect we have the non wide Association studies and non-coding so this means that rather than altering protein structure these variants are attracting regulatory circuits in the cell which in turn means to increase disease for this position and we have evidence that these variants are affecting transcription factor binding by either creating or disrupting binding sites and this leads to downstream changes gene expression so to illustrate the concept on the right here we have this example of a native C variant right so there's a particular binding site here you try to regulate these jeans bounce to him and you can see that the a you have a binding site here so the binding site is intact but whereas with the see this disrupt the binding site that can imagine this to be like an insulin gene or some bad weight relate some important pathway for the for the disease so this means that we understand what is non-coding regulatory circuits are doing we need to know what is happening at the transceiver factor level so if you know these are certain factors you are looking for I have a family can do it every time so one alternative if you don't know what a factor you're looking for or is factor binding from chromatin accessibility profiles which we can generate from a space such as a taxi and DNA seek an attack seek is a very versatile set a sake which is using the TM v transpose a so integrate the genome with accessible regions and generate this open chromatin profiles and to determine where that the apps are binding we can look at the first patterns in the India toxic data and you can see on the schematic here we'd expect so with respect Locard the entities where the TFS earring that is protecting DNA cleavage right and we call business in fact of food prints but turns out that not all the transition factors we've put this and these are figure from Gordon Hagar's lab and it's showing aggregate DNA scrap profiles over to initial vector bound motifs it see the motif here at the Sanford and the sports plot here is showing ctcf and you can see that these are very beautiful together a professor so the amount of protection gear completed compared to the defeated is this higher item highlight black box here but that's not the case for all the factors I have examples here of a g1 + 2 / 4 type receptor and you can see particularly local corticoid receptor and right leaves a very faint protection all right so it was hypothesized that the lambo of this DNA protection is a function of the time that the protein is tiny to DNA its residence time and turns out that ctcf and if you one have long experimentally measured president's type whereas the Google for spoilers sapper is known to bind very drastic treatment less than a second for each binding event so the way we know this actor residence times at least some idea how long they're binding the DNA is by using frappe assays so basically you respect yourself with but just be pegged version of your protein of interest then you bleach photo bleach part of the nucleus shining a laser there many times the time that it takes for the four answers to be published that's mean the molecules that are outside the bleached area are going into the beach area and this recovery time will be a proxy of the transcription factor DNA dynamics so freely diffusing or highly mobile the apps will recover very shortly whereas at slow-moving PS would take minutes and maybe hours if you're doing like a histone for a quick over time it takes hours for those recover because they're so normal viral that it takes time so but the problem of those experiments is that they're very very hard to perform so there is only data available for hand for some factors and is actually thrown up interesting and relevant biology regarding transition effects of residents at times but because focusing more on the tools and tech as fear I'll focus on the question that's directly relevant to us here so how do know which factors with footprints and which don't so that would be a function of the president yes this case you imagine recovering is not as famous residence because pseudo Roxie you measure the morbidity by subtle even if our proteins recite on his filing side for where we shuffle namaha but the fighting side is where we frequently happening around the comedy you were still measure it was still observe the properties sorry yeah I know what you I see what you're saying and there's another type of experiment where they do is single molecule fragments so you're doing at the single molecule level there's high correlation between the single molecule finds and the rats and that frankly proper time so the first piece of population matter right you have your entire population of protein with the GFP attack but still we know from non biology for instance these bones will take hours recover ctcf and for ease and also take many minutes and this factor that you were to fight we separate wouldn't know that they bind very friendly they recalled or very fast so it's a the frack recovery time is paper there's literature showing it's an upper bound of time so this leads to the main topics I'm going to cover during this presentation so first is how to use the attack seek therapy for this dynamics opposition factor DNA interactions and more importantly how much are the tech that you have any predictions influenced by this kinetics and then going to talk about our methods to predict transition factor binding not depending on finding this right so might have seen this lights parcel if you have go ahead and take some pizza but if you haven't this is an important concept so keeping what I said in mind about residence time and DNA interaction let's do this a path experience where we have of what we'd expect to see from the chromatin organization for a transition factor that binds for a very long time in DNA it's something like ctcf is not completely face the local nuclear sauce around so if the nucleus object a is around yeah we're gonna have this evenly spaced shaded regions where with expecting low t & v integration probability rights are protected from from cleavage then we can either y-axis exe fragment size and see what is the expected fragment distribution that we would see in this case so first the small fragments would be adjacent to the transition factor binding site to follow them the left to the right then we'll see some slightly larger fragments integrating on both sides of the decision factor will follow them in grab then we will see some nucleosome sized fragments for their integration on both ends of the adjacent nuclear songs you have Dino course on site so there's any so far right and instead of showing the actual fragment that just showed the fragment meet one so where is the middle of that fragment and in the end we'll have these clouds of fragmented points forming these V patterns around the transcription factor binding site so Steve Chanukah look at those in the context of mnac theorem we're looking at the taxi so it's a different application and now let's see what Percival V plot looks like so on the Left we do the deep lot on ctcf bound motifs on vm to 878 there again the x-axis is the business to the motifs and some of this right at zero and and the y axis is the attack stick fragment size and each point here is going to be a different fragments midpoint and protector is good enough that you can see these clouds of fragmented points forming this pattern around around the city set binding site then we can ask we will see this for every transcription factor so we would look at NF kappa-b Emma found motifs yeah you do single chick there we don't see anywhere close to that platter so and I would like to say that this plots have the same number of points going into them so it's not that you have more saving all on CPC airports designer attribute similar points it's all about the organization the underlying chromatin architecture so we can quantify this differences so let's look at some you know that cities haptic what and we use an information theory approach to measure how order are given the plot is so we can do this by calculating the information content of the fragment size distribution which will tell at every position if the in the x-axis whether the points are uniformly spread along the y axis or if they're concentrated so let's look at the example right here at the center we have high information here it's the majority that the fragments are small fragments next to the binding site so it is so this high information if it was low information then basically we would see a uniform distribution of this mid points along the y axis here some information content right here you can see it's a high all to move a little bit to the left we see there x2 information please see this cloud point here but there's also these other classes a little bit more dispersed information site but not as high now we can move this part of the deep what we have this first put some sized fragments of the person who put something around this position and the information goes up and we do this position until we reach the end here where we have low information and also do it on the other side so we have this track of the observed information for this v1 and I'm just shuffle the points here and we get an old investigation alright so to divide one by the other we get this information content in regional and we can focus at the center inside weeks here which are a fraction of the transition factor binding antara adjacent new blossoms and we can calculate what we call the feature we plot information content engagement chart for advice for short and this is doing a single number a quantitative measurement of the impact of the transition factor in the local chromatin environment and we can do this for every turn signal factor if we know where they find right so looking back at this those CDC afternoon there's a five fold difference in the plot information much more organized than and IB and again this is the same number of points that we're looking for each one so and not that I'm not alive into the valley for the next one so we did that for all the factors that we have chips if data available for GM to 878 and you can see this range of the plot information almost zero pretty much no information all the way to 1 which is ctcf and city 781 those guys with the deep footprints they have the highest scores in this room right so it's the the deep plot information content correlates with food Pratap then basically everything that elasticity CF and if you want won't leave very deep footprints on the table we would or job of predicting where they bite so based on what I just shown before it seems like using footprints to predict TF binding can be potentially problematic for the majority of the discussion factors so we need to come up with a method that does not depend on priming this food that's or any kind of modeling and ideally we should use my bus mattress that should be hopefully less affected by factors such as signal-to-noise grade or sequencing that and I attempt to solving those issues is called Nemo and it's account base algorithm that's looking at the effects a signal at the vicinity of and also at the number of co-occurring motifs right so both of these methods were shown to positively correlate with transcription factor or occupancy so basically the more accessible your motif is the more likely that the app is going to randomly encounter it when it's diffusing along the nucleus and the more binding sites the more chances of your transition factor dwelling on that region so a way to think of that a bit like a B where the decision factor is a beam and the binding sites at flower right so if you have one big open flower it's more likely that a B is going to find there compared to a closed flower and if you have multiple flowers it's more likely that that means going to be around so that's no idea behind our modeling and I can imagine Nimoy's that alpha is alpha so this mean that for each different practices for TF approach we model those two distributions using two different negative binomial one for the attack 1600 and one for the Corcoran voltage now the right here I'm just showing an example fit here for elf one that Surrency a factor that's fairly easy to predict and if you were to predict elf one solving on accessibility so we have this I'm rather the model distribution on blacks observed data we have on the x-axis the number of effective fragments the DC innocent let's see the majority of the data is flanked and Wendy Freidman right and let's say if we want to do predict binding just on taxi signal we say let's say we want the office have a rate of five percent and say everything that's to the right of the faucet every line we predict a pump so you have to have at least twenty four fragments every more every elf one motif instance it has more than by default fragments we can see it as well as bomb so now let's look at how we obtain this model distribution over the ataxic signal and co-occurring motives and also for them how to get a single p value out of two distributions so for the ataxic signal we calculate the number of effect fragments in the vicinity of every count the number of ataxic fragments we nor fragments that integrated directly at the motif sequence so it's been known that both our DNA is an attack see that they have specific sequence bias so it's not completely random how its coding DNA and if you imagine every motif instance here we're gonna have like the motifs at the center and this plus minus 1 another is Parabolica the motif sequence is going to be basically the same across all of those those regions right so we want to avoid any kind of integration buyers and just ignore everything that's integrated directly at the motifs dealing with the attack suffice so we fit a negative binomial distribution on the motif instances outside ataxic things right so the vast majority of motifs outside that exit Peaks would be unbound expose chromatin and this is going to be or no distribution where we calculated these values for automotive instances and for the coca a motif is more simple we just feed the negative binomial distribution on the number of neighboring motifs so how many other ctcf sites are in excess it easy apps that CTC appearances or how many of one instances are next to the one that you're looking for and then we can binomial Annette and again we can calculate a p-value for let's say you have for ctcf specifically you have wanted to share with five others so we take the p-values from the two distributions and combine using this method which is basically just compare the p-value in Twizy sport and then some disease sports all right and we define bound the instances using instead of a positive rate we use the bimini Pacelli for action so this is a little bit more stringent and kind of regular vision in hartford because it's modeling the dependencies of the data in a more general way so this is ideally suited for cases where you have a low proportion of true positives in the data so you expect to have few binding sites like out of that 300,000 or 500,000 ctcf for the businesses you expect like 20,000 of them to be vomit so that's why you use this okay so less compared so we wanted to see how to be more compared to different methods so we compared to first centipede from Roger wicker gravity he is now at Wayne State but this was developed which is lab this one is not directly modeling footage for this model in the ataxic signal at the DC Mitty of each binding site we have DNA CPF from garden Hagar's lab and hint from the course the lab both of these are doing footprint predictions and also some attack 6 by us more than actually the amazing by modeling then we have peak which is also a key method from David here for its lab but this one is grayed out because it does its own internal motif scanning in this kind of hard for us to directly compare the two methods so I can show there later if you want and our baseline is just that please intersect both these with fantastic peaks and is the most simple way of every believe instance that within an attack Sukhdeep we consider that as bombs so if I show the comparison first we're gonna look at precision recall you see if we're comparing this is the view cheap seek the airport and poll and see how well those mentally will take the your binding site from gypsy so all these plots in the next couple slides I'm going to be showing you the more on the y-axis of that our method and the other methods on the XS right so each point here is a different transcription factor you have them the key here and if four point lands above the diagonal it means that Nemo is better for that received a factor in that pathway and I have here the total experience of 37 experience and number of points followed falling above the diagonal so you look at centerfield we outperform three-quarters of the time then we can look at GNA SPF in here and basically I'll perform them on the on this precision recall way you see method this is when Ross Perot there so this is one ataxic dataset but we also have hours and this is what we see on our the asset so very similar but I don't want to focus on precision recall where you see is I want to focus on f1 sports so if you're doing kind of mantle prediction it's not enough that if you rank your predictions by their sport that you can separate in the bound and unbound classes we want to say you want to test it the threshold that your method here or safety more than 24 weeds are predicted us bound its best better compared to the other now take into account both the precision and recall as well as the ester cutoff for each method so it means a more realistic way of comparing those methods and again you can see we are performed and the kids will perform being other methods this is done when roses data and again for our on a taxied better so here for each different point are using the same thread of TX the secret recipe so for our method yes we bother which transcription factor separately and then DNA suit the app and here it's going to give you a bad file of where there are footprints and you have to intersect that with the motif instances to figure out because it doesn't tell you each transcription factor is fine and there it just say I fatherhood yeah so you have to intersect that so in other words be an own is to pre-trained or the cut-offs no it's not pretend doesn't mean supervise no but it's the threshold for considering that's the TF biding you need to go urinate know otherwise about Amenia - charlie correction it's apophis carburettors a p-value people give the p-value yeah there's no training but here when you get f1 score and that's the charlie kappa i develop and that cutoff is supervised but every supervisor and supervised instead or commit equivalent or you send in manually or no no the contain we model we combine the p values of the tool disputed the solution right this is all and supervised there's no at no point to be more is looking at through your binding sites this is just from the ataxic theorem then we get this combined p-value we do a being a maniac which are the correction and everything that's less of 0.05 we considered a spot just a p-value so i think just a few minutes back you were talking about thresholds yes and that's on trial here so you're okay for all your points Jacque fresco is p-value is 0.05 you know f1 score top yes so that means there's Oh transcription factor use the same fresco so this threshold is going to be different so let's say for elf one let's say 24 fragments here right but for ctcf we're gonna model this distribution differently right because it's more than a word message factor what is it we can populate so another way to look at this data is trying to correlate with those we plot information mountains that we looked at before so on the top here I have the transition factor so the ones that you see there is a one that we're making the predictions and their associated the plot information content I'm splitting them into three groups low medium and high default information and you can see the overall prediction performance of this is just the f1 sparked some for each of those methods regarding those different people our information categories and you can see that the moon clearly outperforms the other methods and it's mostly because of this lighter colors here the medium and the low so those guys here they're probably not leading with this and the other methods have a hard time predicting where they're buying grab bars here there's actually not a lot of difference between the Mathis mostly on those two here and another way to look at this is showing a fraction of the best performing prediction but the best fit addiction performance olds for each particular factor here whatever method has the best that once or is going to be the part of the solution and then we took the other method as a fraction of the best performing sports that make sense so let's say or a p1 centipede was the best here so the best what is the fraction my receipts for the other Mathis hassle one method to have an act once for one and the other was 0.8 then it's going to be zero point eight on this and hopefully we can appreciate that the more to the left we go so those high-low information advice the words the other methods yeah any more thought is really here at the top and the only exception is cities yeah so now we should ask if most factors are like cities Yap where the other methods are there or into the majority of transition factors unlike everything else in the spot here where be more outperforms so using the only made predictions and calculated apart informations or for all the transition factors that we have motives available and you can see that basically CTC Act is the very tail after this right so the majority of optimistic effectors are more like the glucocorticoid receptors that leave footprints and not like cities Yap so we shouldn't be using foot linking methods to predict them and then just for making things interesting we filter the mixture model in this data just try to estimate what's the proportion of this high versus low deep lot information yet and you can see that the ctcf and the high informations of the highly ordered people odds yes account for around 20 to 25 and deceits percent depending on the data set up the data and this is actually strikingly consistent with what garden Hagar's group they measure the depth of the footprints and they found that the factors with the footprints corresponds 20% of all the transition factors that they they measure solvents encouraging to see they are think these are completely different metrics are this is measuring food prediction and we are the party from their taxi information father and I wanted into this and that was hard to see but we looked for the proteins that are associated with each of those incision factors and look at what are the protein domains that associate with that high and horrifies distribution and there's there's different so we see different protein domains I mean which for the height advise the high information content yes compared to the others of this and supports a via that this might be two different classes of transcription factor right and so let's go back to the photo bleaching si and let's look at how Luke combined predictions and look at how they correlate with those frappe recovery time so get an idea if this V plot information form and that we measured correlates with the transcription factor diet DNA dynamics so that's what I'm showing here on the y axis I have the advice of the what information content on on the x axis I have the experimentally measured frac recovery time or if this factors over here and hopefully I can appreciate that there is a nice correlation so ctcf now very high report information right at the top here then we have crab fries and intermediate factor at the sample here i can add a cup of Y which look before great right at the bottom here and we did this in our own better certainly fine basically the same correlation Alex so I do have that that's the limitation of those practice otherwise otherwise we would know so that's something that we're excited to be able to which leads gives some horses I wouldn't count like the advices of man like as a prediction of the residence time but at least you can get some ballpark if your factor is more like ctcf or if it's more like the people 45% so without doing those very intensive experiments right so before we go to the live demo we can conclude from this data they're shown here that transition factors vary in the impact in the Lobeck Roman architecture and this correlates with measures of residence time asparagus and the negative binomial modeling of is a better overall predictor of transition factor by mean that footman and most likely because the majority statistical factor had much lower the thoughts of much lower chromatin information than cities yeah so let's do some demo if you want to do if you want to use in your own lab I just okay all right so you can go just move our terminology okay so we can go to github back home Parker laughs laughs that you just need your attack seek you need your BAM files you need your because any need one bad file for motif right so we have a little some hints of how to format and get those right and if you want to solve just get from Guillermo and F us now is built on snake make so I'll be giving a talk on technique on November 30 and to make things more reproducible instead of you having to install yourselves they make and all the differences we have a home the environments that you can source and activate directly this will make it easier during the closer and you don't have ten minutes if you access or simply don't want to mess around with your the famous right so just run this step here this command here and then you activate and for the first time you do that you also have to stop some of the art dependencies that we don't we cannot include them with qualifies it's just packages and in order to so what do you need run let's show the example here so you have your fat files here's with motifs you have your BAM files and you need this the big file did smooth teeth this is just just a name of the piece you want to run in case you don't want to run the config file you need to make this fixed file that what snake makes uses so basically just need to say where it's being more installed where did you come we're like what older are your motives what is the extension if the file that contains the motive names and where do you want to put the results and then we have some more Advanced Options and then for each sample you just need to see what is the BAM file and what is the big file so I have the description here and I'm to run basically you just environment and run this command here so snake makes following a snake make I'm saying we were running with four threads and I'm giving the config file and now voice is going to calculate the attack succeed no on the on the bad five seats over here is gonna take like ten seconds to do this example and then so here are all the steps old vs. managering the broth the text 16 isn't for the second motif then is gonna be it's the negative by notice and then finally run and once this is done go back here after Seoul we created this work directory here that's where the the results are coming yeah so now it's reading this is this is so it's just reading the data feeding the co-occurring motive distribution calculating the p-value is using that some z-score and that's it so we can go to work example once we don't have one folders word file in in this bound directory you have the predicted calls predicted bound cities yeah if so everything that's on this bad file is what we movie leaders have found and we can directly use this as input for wherever you want and if you're not satisfied and we are thresholds we provide this other folder here is called off and this actually has the whole automatic so what was the ataxic signal for usually instance these p-values for the taxing signal for the cocoa nibs the combined value p-value the adjusted p-value and this is predicted bound or not everything is hopefully gonna say that this is easier and everything else that's out there okay yeah and so I briefly mentioned sneak make but I have an upcoming segment thought that markets was fine enough to invite me for the highlight it is going to be November 30 3:30 young reasons to come there's free pizza as well and that will be fine so from your taxi taxi experiment you only need a vamp fire with the actual needs and the pitfalls I saw because you need to fit the model with the weeds or sidepiece so beginning talk about the G bars how does the so you can move for instance you can use wherever at once that try to do enrichment of features in you was snips so I actually don't have to be they don't have this light geared but I have a slide I have a I've done an analysis where we inputted  predictions right so all the all everything that we may consider that woodsman versus just attacks each piece and we get a better enrichment India was hits on the predictions compared to the ataxic peak so we're narrowing down or where those parents are another way to look at it like imagine you have big linkage disequilibrium block and you have a lead snip yep the one that with the highest signal but you don't really know for all those parents in LD with definite leads need which of those only which of those are the cause of parents or at least potentially cause a parent so you can intersect that with the which the beam of predictions and see that which of those could you want you might want to look for others so so far that's up to you right so that's we just generates the predictions and then however you want to analyze so if you want to input them whether you could for instance we did a similar work for whooshes can ask paper where we predicted we made predictions with centipede and then we ran the entirety to type 2 diabetes catalog on those predictions and we find that there's this factor called artifacts 6 potentially that's enriched for the type 2 diabetes snip so it could be a factor that's driving the phenotype and that case we look at every possible prediction and calculated which was associated with disease so there's there's multiple ways to look at there or maybe you just want to see is your transcription factor binding add known and answers are forever process your interest after you have a pair for you have the genes and you have the promoters order or the enhancer associated with each of those genes and endo see which factors are enriched but the DP family are enriched there that make sense so further required input the metallic Peaks they're also called from the vampires they yes there any way you could internalize this step so you only input the up that file that will make it much easier actually yeah this is just going to be as others naked don't buy anything yeah I can make this automatic so you don't give them vampire its fireworks wings call but then it's going to use Mac students how do you distinguish TF binding and other non specific protein violence say other structural proteins non-histone structural proteins by the same place he was no coil T now you don't have the ability to do that what you have the motives right associated with decision factor so yeah that's an important question we're limited things to transition factors that have no motive cannot you cannot look at factor it's like you cannot predict his bone behind me or anything like that because they don't have no cubes so you're constrained within this movie well any other questions thank you for asking about the craft
