so welcome everyone thanks for joining us today for the tools and technology seminar series um if you have questions uh at any point during the presentation you can put them in the chat box i'll be monitoring that and can let our speaker know if questions come up or if you prefer just ask them audibly you can use the zoom reactions at the bottom right of your screen to raise your hand and i can always call on you we can ask you to unmute yourself at that time so i'd like to just quickly introduce our speaker today we have nicole sieberlich who is an associate professor of radiology and biomedical engineering and is also co-director of the michigan institute for technology and translation great thank you for the introduction and you know as marcy said um if you have any questions please feel free to put them in the chat so i think it's probably better if um questions can be asked while i'm giving the talk instead of holding them all to the end because there may be things that you want me to clarify and you can also just unmute yourself and go ahead and ask um so as marzi said i am an associate professor in the radiology department and also the co-director of the michigan institute for imaging technology and translation i moved to the university of michigan almost three years ago so almost completely in the pandemic but not quite and before that i was um an associate professor in the department of biomedical engineering at um case western reserve university so i'm kind of a biomedical person at heart and my phd is actually in physics so even though i'm in the radiology department i'm not a doctor at all or not an md type doctor but i do work with a lot of doctors and so um you know while my research is focused on how to make mri scanning faster and cheaper and better we're going to take a much more holistic approach to mri in in this presentation um because i think this actually might suit you guys a little bit better okay so first i want to start off by saying mri is amazing like the fact that we can make images like this of the inside of the human body is is totally incredible um this technology is not really that old so it's celebrating almost its 50th anniversary or birthday i guess um probably i think next year is the official year that will be its 50th birthday um and mri has been used in a clinical setting for probably about 40 years um and before we had technologies like this if we wanted to know what was going on inside somebody's body often they would do exploratory surgery where they just you know cut the person open and look around to see what is going on inside the person and now we have this amazing technology it's just one but a pretty useful one that we can use to make diagnoses in a way that's much less intrusive than doing something like that um okay so as i mentioned before while my research is all about how to make mri better i'm not going to talk about my research today instead we're going to take a brief look at mri and then see how mri can be used clinically i want to go over some of the characteristics that we look for in our images so kind of the constraints that we have when we are thinking about making images with mr then i will delve into how we make mri images so this is a little bit more of the physics we may go through this faster or slower depending on how much time we have and then i want to wrap up a little bit by talking about the various mri scanners and groups that we have here at the university of michigan so that you can better understand the landscape of of mr here um and i do want to mention right now this caveat that i'm going to be focusing mostly on human mri so mri using radiology the clinical uses of this technology i'm not going to be talking much about small animal imaging although we do have a lot of facilities here where the basic physics are the same but of course the uses then are totally different for for these different mri scanners okay so mri is clearly an essential tool for us in radiology so when you think about medical imaging you probably think about x-rays cts and mri and each of these three different imaging modalities has totally different strengths and they would be put to use in very different ways um so you can see in this kind of you know example x-ray image that what we see is mostly bones and that's what we'll use x-rays for bones and um often to look at the lungs as well um ct allows us to see some of this soft tissue so this is actually brain tissue and we can use it sometimes to look at plain brain bleeds and things like that but it's very difficult to distinguish different kinds of soft tissue from one another so for instance here it's hard to see the difference between white matter and gray matter in the brain it's all just tissue kind of nct and this is where mri comes in mri allows us to depict different kinds of soft tissues very clearly so here you can see that there's a good delineation between gray matter and white matter and also here this is the um it's a ventricle in the brain where you can see the csf and it's due to this ability to distinguish multiple different types of tissues from one another that mri is really very important in in clinical radiology um so here's another set of examples again here's the x-ray where we can see the bones the ct where we can see bones here but not really distinguish that much else and then an mri here's two different contrasts where we've collected our data in slightly different ways so we can highlight different aspects of the tissue so we can see here the spinal cord we can see some of the tissue in the discs here in between the vertebrae and some of the musculature of the spine in different ways depending on how we collect our mri image so as i mentioned before an mri one of the main strengths is that we can change um which tissues are bright and dark depending on how we set up our skin i'm going to come back to this image a couple of times during the presentation so that you can see how some of these tissues are very different so let's just take as an example um the csf here this is the fluid in these ventricles it's very dark in this image it's very bright in this image and it's kind of intermediate in this image here um and csf isn't normally something that we really need to highlight in our images but it does serve the point that we can really change how this tissue will look in comparison to other tissues by playing with this contrast we can also see different tracks here in the fibers in this image here where we don't really see all that much in this image over here um so this is great because it allows us to discriminate different types of tissues from one another but what that usually means in an mri scan is that we are going to be spending a lot of time collecting a lot of different images with different kinds of contrasts in different orientations maybe looking um so this is an example here of a coronal slice through the top of the body where we see the lungs the liver the kidneys here's part of the spine we can also make a cut directly through the body so here we're seeing basically the body on its side where again we see this is some intestines up here we can see the kidneys down here here's the spine down here and all of these images again will be specifically designed to allow the radiologist to be able to separate different types of tissue and to look for any structural abnormalities that might be going on in this person um so when we talk about a typical mri scan so here's here's one of our scanners that we have here at the university of michigan um this will involve a couple of steps so the first thing we have to do is bring the patient in we screen them for safety um because as we'll talk about in a little bit this mri scanner is a big giant magnet and so we have to make sure that um you know when the patient goes into the magnetic fields they don't have any metal in their body which will cause harm to the patient when they're giving their skin they change into a gown so again they don't have any metal on their clothes we lie the patient down on this table and they zoom into the scanner and then the scan lasts a pretty long time between 30 and 60 minutes usually because we need to collect all of those different images with different contrasts and different orientations and that can take a long time depending on what we need to see in our images so the mri technologist is the one who is going to be running the scan they're doing all of these different collection routines we call them different sequences to get all those different images we may administer a contrast agent so this would go in intravenously basically into your veins so that we can look at your blood vessels um more clearly and depending on the kind of scan we may ask the patient to hold their breath while we're collecting the images because any motion while we're collecting the images can lead to errors in the images that can be a little bit annoying for the patient depending on what kind of skin we're doing and then after we're done with the whole scan we send all the images to radiologists for them to evaluate them to see what's going on with their patients okay so what kinds of things would we be scanning for um in mri well the most you know obvious thing is that we're going to look for any problems in anatomy so if there's anything that's that shouldn't be there in the wrong place too small for instance that's what we'd want to see in these images so again this is an image of somebody's torso basically like a cut directly through their head like in this direction and you can see that this is actually the skin of the patient this black part here is fat that would be surrounding the patient depending on how we can collect our data we can make the fat go away so it's easier to see other parts usually the water in the organs here you can see the liver again here's the stomach we have the aorta coming down here um we have here's some intestines you can see the hip bones down here and we're just looking for for any abnormalities anything that is structurally incorrect in these images we can do this in all different parts of the body so here's an example again of a brain image where we can clearly see the cerebellum looking really nice down here um this is of the brain stem and of course their nose and their mouth and teeth and everything this is another example of a spine image and this is just a cute image that i think is kind of nice of a a mom and a baby in in the mri scanner okay so um often what the radiologists will do is look at an image and they know after seeing tons and tons of these images what looks normal and what doesn't look normal so this is an example of a normal mri scan of the brain this is an example of a patient who has an enlarged ventricle so you can clearly see right that there's something going on here this ventricle is much larger than it should be and this is you know again a structural abnormality that would be immediately obvious to a radiologist um here's another couple of examples where even we can tell that there's probably something going on here that shouldn't be going on of course usually these findings are more subtle than that but this is you know an example of what could be seen with this technology uh we can also as i mentioned before give contrast agents we can see blood vessels really clearly so the contrast will make these blood vessels very bright if we collect our signal correctly so we can look to make sure that all the vessels are you know intact nothing's occluded um you know there's not something strange going on in the development of these blood vessels this is an example of a patient with an arterial venous malformation so it's like a big tangle of blood vessels here up in the brain and this would be something that you know radiologists would say hey we don't really want that there and what they might look for is actually the blood vessel that is feeding blood to this this arterial venous malformation avm in order to basically um try to block this off so we could starve this avm of its blood and then they could eventually go in and take it out so this is the kind of thing that they'd be looking for um the other thing that mri is really good at looking at is determining if there are tissues which shouldn't be there so this is usually cancer is what we're talking about and again the the properties of the cancerous tissue are sufficiently different from the properties of healthy tissue that if we if we plan our mri scan properly we collect the data correctly and it should be pretty easy to generate contrast between healthy brain tissue here and this glioblastoma which you can see here this is just another example of a glioblastoma that is basically coming into the ventricle of this person's brain um this is um an example again of cancer in um in the liver this is a hepatocellular carcinoma so hcc you actually see this little cancer here um and depending on how the data are collected we can either make it brighter or darker and it's the combination of all of these different contrasts together that the radiologist will look at and say okay that's that's definitely a cancer and not something else not maybe something benign these are just a couple of other images showing very similar examples um finally we can look at um you know we're not looking for completely different tissues but we're looking to see if there's something that's off about the tissue that um it should be there but you know maybe it's not functioning quite properly um so here's an example of the heart so this is the left ventricle of the heart the right ventricles over here actually all this white stuff is blood in here and these little dark points are the papillary muscles here you can see the lungs up here and then there's some liver and stuff down here um and what's happening in these images is that this is just the normal cardiac tissue it looks fine in this image but some contrast agent was administered and that contrast agent gets stuck anytime that there is scar tissue so the contrast agent which is making the tissue bright is actually right here can kind of see it a little bit but the problem is because of the way these images are collected it's hard to generate a difference in signal from the blood which is here and this little scar tissue but if we wait long enough then that contrast agent which was flowing through the blood and into the scar it'll go out of the blood so the blood becomes a little darker but it'll get stuck in the area of a scar which is pretty easy to see in these so-called delayed enhancement image so so it's not like cancer it's not like tissue that you know is growing that shouldn't be there but it's just indicating that something's wrong with this tissue um this is another similar idea where this is a healthy liver where they're looking at this this patch of signal in the liver and saying like okay it seems you know pretty pretty much like we would expect from healthy liver but when the liver becomes serratic so it starts to uh generate again fibrosis that the the texture of the images becomes very different and it's fairly easy to see that this liver isn't working exactly like it should be and then there's a lot of work especially here at the university of michigan to look at organ function with mri so this is not looking at the structure anymore but to see like how well these different organs are are actually doing what they should be doing so fmri functional mri is kind of you know something everyone's heard of where the the idea of functional mri is that the the subject is exposed to some sort of stimulus so either something that they're looking at or something that they hear and then with the mri scan we can see which parts of the brain are getting more blood which parts are working harder um so we take a simple um just a regular scan to look at the structure of the brain and then usually overlaid on that are the areas which once we do our mri scan look like they're activating a little bit more and so we can basically say what parts of the brain are are important in understanding whatever that stimulus is that they've gotten we do functional mri for other organs as well so for instance we can look at the function of the heart um so this is a little bit hard to see here but what you're seeing is the volume of the left ventricle as it's beating and so this the volume should get smaller and then bigger again and you can use that in order to describe how well the heart is functioning how much blood it can pump out with every beat it's doing and of course can't get away without showing some movies this is a lot of what i do so basically what's happening in these images is that they've been collected um pretty fast one after another and if we play them all in a row then they just make a movie showing the heart beating so um this is again how we'd figure out how well the heart is functioning so here again we see this is the the heart wall this kind of grayish part here the white part is the blood um this is the left ventricle the right ventricle and then the atria up here you can actually see this valve here which is kind of flapping open to keep the blood out and then let the blood in um and these are just a whole bunch of vessels basically at the top of the heart that you can see um you know the blood is moving in and out of them um this is kind of a cool example where we're not really looking at the function of an internal organ but looking at speech so how the mouth would move this isn't necessarily something that a radiologist would look at but maybe somebody who's doing speech therapy or trying to understand how the mouth is moving when we are making certain sounds and mri can do that as well and then i just have a couple of other cool movies that i thought were really interesting so um we haven't really talked about how mri works yet but it doesn't use any radiation um so you might think of x-rays and cts as scans that involve radiation and so we don't want to give those scans unnecessarily mri we also don't want to do unnecessarily but because it doesn't involve any radiation it doesn't pose a risk to to anybody whether you're an adult or a fetus and so we can make images like this showing basically the motion of of a baby in utero you can actually see the baby is kind of sucking his thumb at some point again we may not make these on a routine basis but but they don't pose any harm to to anybody getting a scan um this is an example of somebody's brain you're seeing their eyes move back and forth and actually what i really like about this is just how much the optic nerve here which is connecting the eye to the brain is moving around um this is something you might not think about every day and this is not a human it's an artichoke and it's a three-dimensional view through an artichoke which yes i know this is not made in our human scanners is made on a small animal scanner it's just really pretty and kind of shows the the cool internal structures that we can see using techniques like mri which um are difficult to see in other ways nicole i have a quick question i might cover this but are the functional mris is the machine the same equipment as a non-functional as just different software that's incorporated exactly yep so functional mri and basically all of these every scan except for this artichoke which maybe i should just back up from just so we can get rid of it these are all made with the same types of mri scanners so um they're all um we call them just human scanners it's a 3t or 1.5 t mri scanner and our research scanners and our clinical scanners are exactly the same really we just we buy them from the manufacturer and use them for different things but they're really exactly the same hardware you know maybe with minor minor modifications so you know if you're doing an fmri scan the person can see out of the scanner you know to see whatever the visual stimulus is but the only thing that's different is the software and that's why the the scanner console like what we're actually doing at the scanner is so important and becomes very complicated very quickly but with exactly the the same hardware it's a great question okay and perfect timing because we're about to switch gears to when we analyze these images what are we actually looking at um so in my job um and in you know a lot of um human mri the end user of our scans is the radiologist right so when we we think about what they're looking at an image that's the kind of thing that we look at when we're developing new techniques so you know the most obvious is the size or volume of whatever right is it is it a normal size or volume question um so in some scans we can easily see right this is this ventricle's too big this is not normal so they might measure the size and that's the kind of information that they would report they might also look at the size of a tumor let's say this is you know this is how big it is um based on all these different images where with different contrast where they can definitely tell it's a tumor and of course we also look at the sizes and volumes of you know the the ventricle here in the heart to see how much blood is being pumped out and if it's something that they're trying to follow over time they may use cereal scans to say did whatever we're measuring change is it getting better is it getting worse is it just different and this is you know again a pretty straightforward measurement on an mri scanner where it's just looking at you know the size of something um the other thing that we often look at is is the tissue does it look right is it too bright or too dark and and mri scans are really weird i'm not going to get into this here um in great detail but you know the actual like if we would you know draw whoopsies we would draw a little circle in this patch of the image and try to measure the numbers in this image those numbers themselves aren't a measurement of anything specific the the actual signal intensity is a combination of a whole bunch of different factors and so um we can't just you know draw a little patch and say did this number get bigger or smaller over time because it's not a meaningful number um and again it's complicated why we'll talk about that maybe in a little bit but what we can say is that we expect myocardium to be homogeneous um it should not change in signal intensity and so when we see that there's a little patch here that is too bright in this case we say that there's something different about this tissue than about you know the rest of this tissue it's it's something's wrong and the radiologists that they're trained for years and years to be able to tell you if it's bright on this and dark on that and medium on this then that means x especially given the clinical characteristics of the patient um so we use this too bright too dark all the time even though you know i think when you actually think about it that it's a little funny that that's how mri works um i showed this image before where um you know we looked at this patch of of liver and compared it to this patch of liver to say well the signals here are different and again we aren't going to necessarily look at the numbers that we're measuring there but um you know here they're looking actually at the standard deviation over a patch of signal which even that is probably a little questionable but um you know it's just looking at different qualities in the tissue to say this is this is bright or dark or wrong i shouldn't be here okay so um the last thing that we use a lot again when we're evaluating our images is does the radiologist like it um and i know this sounds crazy but often what the radiologist is looking at is a very small portion of the image and so anything that we would change in collecting those images might change the image in a way that it's no longer sufficient for the radiologist to use for the purpose that they would want to use it for um so this is not something that's easy to you know look at a difference or a mean squared error or you know it's very difficult to actually quantify which is the bane of you know the existence of many mri and other medical imaging researchers but what we often do is um give our images to radiologists to have them rate them and that's our best quantitative metric of our image quality unfortunately um so for instance this is from a study that i've been doing where we have at the bottom the old method i collected these three images using an old technique and then i collected whoops the top ones using a new method um we collected all these basically at the same time and we asked the radiologists to rate the old images versus the new images and it seems very disturbing but this is the best quantitative again metric we have um and we basically say okay the the red bars are the ratings for the um new images the blue bars are the ratings for the old images the higher the score the better those images are and if we you know look at enough images and have them rated by a couple of cardiologists or radiologists then we can tell whether we're actually getting a significant difference improvement or or lack of improvement in our new techniques um so we look at all these do a statistical analysis and say okay basically in everything except one reader for you know the right ventricular wall um we had a statistically significant improvement in our image quality um so this may feel a little unsatisfactory but that's usually how we're looking at our images okay um so i'm going to kind of dovetail now into what an mr image actually is right i'm talking about these images but like what is that okay so um this is an mr image and it's really just a grid of of pixels of numbers that we present in a you know 2d matrix in order to make an image this may be obvious but i just want to put it out there but if i kind of zoomed in here to see what was going on in my image i would see you know a whole bunch of different numbers where we take the the lower numbers here we make those dark and we take the higher numbers and make those white and the medium numbers are some sort of gray and that's basically what we're looking at when i'm showing you this image so this is very different than like you know if you think about an x-ray where they would project it directly onto a film where it's basically like an analog picture so mri is not that it's it's all digital um and that's what you're actually seeing that's what i'm representing in this image unfortunately um we can't just you know put our object or our patient into the scanner and immediately capture this image because mri is a little bit more complicated than that and we have to do this detour through the space where we actually collect our data um so we're collecting our data in the space called k space so this is what actually happens when we're sitting at the mrs console we're directing the scanner to collect this data and once we have this data we do a mathematical transformation on this data called the fourier transform which gets us to this image so it's not important to really understand where that's coming from but the fact that we work in this other space is actually has a lot of implications on the the image that we get out okay so what do we care about in these images so when we're thinking about how to make them we usually care about the resolution the contrast between different tissues the signal to noise ratio um the total time it takes to make the scan and then artifacts so we'll look at each one of these individually okay so here's my image right it's just a matrix full of numbers and um i have a couple of different there's a couple different values that we use to talk about this matrix of numbers that makes up the image um so the first is what's called the field of view that's basically how big this area is that we need to scan so for the brain it might fit into a field of view of like 250 millimeters by say 250 millimeters these values don't have to be the same but often they are just because it makes it easier if we're talking about the abdomen it might be a larger field of view it's a larger area we have to cover and unfortunately because of the way mri works everything that is in this plane that we're trying to make an image of has to fit into the field of view we can't just zoom in to like a small little area in here um it doesn't work like that basically um we need to have everything in that in this kind of box all the signal has to be coming from there um we also have then how big of an area each of these individual numbers represents um so this is actually the resolution and the resolution of our scans are typically between one millimeter and two millimeters so you can imagine like you know there's a lot of different kinds of tissue that would fit in like a cube that's one millimeter by one millimeter by one millimeter but all of that gets kind of compressed down into one number which represents whatever is going on in that pixel or that that voxel is what we call that three-dimensional space that's kind of being all squished together to to be represented as a single number in mri and then also important for us is how many numbers we need across this whole area and that so for instance in the x direction is going to be the size of the field of view in this direction divided by you know how big each of these individual boxes are so if the field of view is 250 millimeters and each of these little boxes represents one millimeter that's basically the size of the tissue that we're going to represent in there then we're going to need 250 numbers across this direction to represent the entire field of view and again we do the same thing in the y direction and none of these numbers has to be the same it can all be totally different because they're just two orthogonal different directions which we can totally treat as independent so this is our resolution and field of view portion um so this is an example of a knee scan with a poor resolution that um basically the the amount of tissue we're trying to represent as one number is just too much and when we do that we can't see fine edges and details and the radiologists would probably come back and say this is not a very good image because the resolution is too low what they want is an image that looks like this where the resolution is much higher we can see those those edges it's a lot crisper and there's reasons that we would try to push the radiologist more towards an image that looks like this because it's much faster to collect which we'll talk about in a second um this image takes a lot more time but has a lot more potential information that could be used for a diagnosis so there's always a trade-off between these guys the other thing that radiologists are really very concerned about rightfully so is this contrast that they want to be able to make sure that there's going to be a distinction between different types of tissues especially tissues that they want to be able to discriminate from one another so for instance you know if there was a tumor hiding in here but in these three images the tumor had exactly the same signal intensities as the healthy tissue surrounding it we wouldn't be able to see it right and that would kind of ruin the whole point of the mri exam and so depending on what they're looking for they will set up the scan to have different contrast so that they can look for those different you know different abnormalities that they may be wanting to rule out in these images so as an example um this is it's not a beautiful image but here's the liver and there's a tumor in here and it is a little bit darker than the surrounding tissue but i would say that the scan parameters haven't really been optimized to be able to separate this tumor from the rest of this tissue so this might not be the best set of settings for for this particular deployment of mri whereas here you can clearly see there's something different here right and the radiologist will know again that you know if it's bright on one and dark on another then that means it's this type of tissue and this again is an hcc where you can again clearly distinguish it based on the difference in contrast between these two images so this along with resolution is really really important uh radiologists also care about the signal to noise ratio so let me just get to some of these images so basically the signal is is actual true signal arising from water molecules in part of the body we're trying to look at noise can come from a whole bunch of different places but the the noisier the image the lower the snr the more it will look like this and what a radiologist wants is a high snr image and this also sometimes can take a lot of time to get an image where we have the right contrast a high resolution and an enough signal to have an image that's like this and not like this okay so um the thing that i have been talking about telling you about but i haven't told you about yet so so here's our image um you know it has a certain field of view a certain resolution and it's related to the mri data which is over on the right hand side through the fourier transform the 2d fourier transform or the it's the discrete fourier transform which is why it says dft um and so this is the space that the mri scanner is actually collecting and once it has it all then it can convert it into this image and the way that we usually collect data and mri is um you know we need to collect for every number we have over here so for every you know nx times ny number we need to collect one number in our two-dimensional k-space data and often we collect these numbers not one at a time but we can collect them efficiently a line at a time so we'll collect one line and then we have to often wait for the magnetization to do what we want it to do to make this image then we collect another line and so on and so forth until we've collected all of the lines of our data space then we can convert it back into this image so if we look at how long it takes us to collect this data again um we need to collect ny number of lines that's how many one two three how many lines we have in this direction times the amount of time it takes us to collect one line and this time will depend on the contrast that we want in our image but we want bright what we want dark um and we call it the tr so i think i have it's a replacement here where it takes us tr to collect one of these lines here um so the number of line the number of lines times the time to collect each line is the total acquisition time we have for for this data set and as i mentioned before all of these things kind of come together in mri to form like this horrible triangle of doom where we can scan really fast but we'll have to have a low resolution or very low signal or both we can try to get to a very high resolution scan but this takes us a long time and we will lose signal because each of our little little voxels full of magnetization will be very small and we can try to get a high snr but to do that takes a very long time and we would typically go to a lower resolution and so it's always a matter of trying to find the space on this triangle which is appropriate for the um the indication that the patient is coming in for for the scan and that may depend um you know it really is a factor of what the radiologist needs to see in those individual images and the thing that um we also have to keep in mind which can be really tricky is this idea of artifacts um so this is kind of off that triangle of doom because these artifacts can come from all sorts of different sources so an artifact is anything that appears in our image that isn't actually in the object so for instance this is somebody's brain here you can see their eyes up here this is actually their nose um and all of this stuff which is on the outside of the head that isn't really there right it's not actually in you know it's not surrounding the patient a signal that's coming from somewhere else it shouldn't be there um that's you know a function of how we collected our data or how we process the data and what's actually happening in this particular scan is that the patient is moving their eyes and this motion that's happening while we're collecting our data because of this strange transform we have to do to get from our data space to our image is causing these weird kind of fluffy looking artifacts um and often a radiologist can look at that and say you know what i'm not interested actually in anything up here i'm interested in what's going on in the brain so i'm not going to let this bother me but sometimes these artifacts can be more disruptive and they could even mimic pathology if we're not careful um here's an example of a brain scan so again here's the the brain here's the neck down here and this is where the person's mouth should be but they're wearing braces and braces are metal and mri works with a big magnet and the metal combines with the magnetic field of the magnet in order to basically make it impossible to do any scans in that part of the of the anatomy so you can see here and i see my little picture but maybe you can see under me there we go um this is again this kind of hole in where the front of the brain is and that is just disruption of the magnetic field due to due to the braces here um here's what happens if we try to make our field of view smaller than the object so you can see that um you know i said oh i'm not going to worry about this part the brain that's on the outside because i don't really care about that it actually starts to appear on the other side everything has to kind of squeeze into the field of view and that causes problems not only at the edges but it can also cause some issues in other places in the image again because of this weird relationship between the data space and the image and this for some of our scans is the biggest problem of all so here's the back of the patient and here's basically their tummy and this is the liver here which is obscured by all of these these rings of things you can see there's something going on up here what's happening in these scans is that the patients started to breathe while we were collecting data and you could imagine that you know the image doesn't doesn't look like this the entire time when they're breathing you know sometimes when we're collecting our data their um you know their belly has puffed up and sometimes they might be you know letting their air out so it might be smaller and it doesn't result in just a blurry image it actually results in you know these strange sort of effects all throughout the image again because of this weird relationship between how we collect the data and have to convert that into an image so it can be a little unexpected um occasionally to see what the the results on these these images can be um so not only do we have to worry about the the time of the imaging the contrast and the image how much signal we have in the image we also have to try to avoid artifacts like this and in some cases we could say please try to keep your eyes still or put the artifact somewhere where the radiologist doesn't care sometimes you know there's not a lot we can do if they have braces like this most braces and things like that aren't aren't a problem anymore they don't cause these big artifacts we have to make sure that we include the entire object and what we're scanning and then you know down here we have to squeeze this is another acquisition time problem we have to squeeze our whole acquisition into the amount of time that the subject can hold their breath okay so um in the interest of not keeping you for a very long time i'm not going to get into this now i'm happy to come back and talk to you about how we collect mr images if you ever want to hear that i am going to zoom down to mri here at the university of michigan because we are the people you can contact if you ever have any questions about mr so we have at least 20 human mri scanners these are housed in all sorts of different departments but many in the department of radiology and um you might hear a 1.5 tesla or three tesla mri scanners these are very common clinical mri scanners that we would have floating around we are also one of the very first groups to get an fda approved low field system this is a 0.55 tesla so a lower magnetic field system and that's this guy right here which again looks like any normal clinical system but we are lucky enough to be able to use it for for research as i mentioned at the beginning of the talk there are many other animal scanners that we have access to so these are often much higher field strengths but here you can fit a person and here you can only fit some small animal so these are not suitable for human scanning but if you're not interested in scanning humans there's a ton of these out there and these are in all sorts of different departments at michigan medicine so radiology radiation ecology there's some in surgery and then in departments of engineering as well like biomedical engineering they have a couple of scanners over there um so there are also several groups who do research and have research mri scanners so these are scanners which you know people who want to do research projects on them can call us up and we can all work together to figure out how to make those research projects possible um so two of our scanners are um with me at the michigan institute of imaging technology and translation um so i co-direct that with dr goulani and radiology and we have a 1.5 tesla system and a 0.55 t system for development and application of new mri techniques there's also the 3t lab which is run by tom shenover also in the radiology department and he has a three tesla mri system um which is used also for development and then more translational work so um he does a lot of like clinical trial scanning and and he has a really wonderful system for that and then in biomedical engineering doug knoll and his team have the functional mri laboratory they do a lot of this fmri scanning where they're looking for different activations in the brain um and he has i think two 3t mri systems maybe just one but i'm pretty sure it's two of them um and these groups are are independent but all work very closely together um so you know if you contact one of us and we think you would be better suited to work with another there's you know no competition we're all we're all a happy mri family here at the university of michigan um and so i just wanted to you know touch very very briefly on one slide on some of the the research that's happening here so we we like to use mri in all sorts of new applications so this is working really closely with with our clinical partners to find new ways of helping patients with mri so looking at patients with cardiac arrhythmias or using fmri to help surgeons avoid like important parts of the brain that they may not want to touch when they're going in to do surgical planning we also are working on improving existing mri techniques um so you know in in radiology tom schnever is looking at making consistent measurements of tissue diffusion on all different kinds of scanners uh my group is working on using our low field system for clinical imaging so this is you know basically trying to figure out how we can make these scanners immediately better for clinical usage and then a lot of us do kind of way more out there things like trying to figure out new ways of collecting or processing mri data so we crack open the h the hood of our mri scanner and say we want to do things totally different not at all like it's been programmed to do before and that allows us to do really cool things like map tissue properties or to develop new machine learning techniques to use less data to make images faster and better and with higher snr and everything so all of this is going on here we range really from basic mri research all the way to clinical areas as well okay so i hope that that was what you guys were looking for and um i want to thank you for um for coming and and joining and if you have any questions i'm happy to answer them now i also put my email address um here in case you want to contact me and then you can check out the website of the michigan institute for imaging technology and translation that is down at the bottom so with that i will i'll wrap up and i'll be happy to take any questions that you have thank you nicole i really appreciate that presentation is very interesting so yeah if anyone has any questions you can put them in the chat box or simply unmute yourself and we can give it a couple minutes see if anyone has any questions i don't bite well we're waiting to see if anyone else has anything i was wondering if you could actually say a couple more words about the machine learning efforts to remove artifacts or various aspects from the images yeah so that's a really good question um basically everyone's using machine learning to do everything right now so um i'm just gonna zoom back to i can somehow it's not liking me okay um so going back to the slide about the data which is right here um so one of the tricks that we like to use to make our scans faster is just not collect all of these lines of data we're like it takes too long so we're just going to skip some of these and if we do that then we end up with artifacts in our image they don't look good and the radiologists don't want to use them um but we have all sorts of additional sources of information that we could plug into like an intelligent sort of imaging reconstruction algorithm like machine learning um like um information about prior scans that the patient may have gotten or scans and different modalities or features that we know our image should have that we would like the reconstructed image to retain even though we didn't actually collect enough data to reconstruct the whole image and so we um we and everybody else you know in the mri world have been working on training machine learning algorithms to you know take in data that's not quite enough to make an image but you know if we have a network that's been trained to be able to extract the important parts of the image from that not enough data you can output an image that's just as good as if we had collected all of the data um it's a little tricky to train networks like that because you don't want the concern is always if you train a network on you know images that don't have tumors and then you show it images with tumors is it going to output an image without a tumor because it hasn't seen that before and so there's all sorts of testing that goes on there um but i think that you know this is where machine learning is very powerful it's just a matter of figuring out how to teach it the right things and ask it to do things that it's been trained to do great thank you again if anyone else has questions you can feel free to just unmute yourself or just put them in the chat box and we'll just give it just a minute we're right at about 10 till so we'll wrap up shortly if there are no questions
