hi everyone um it's nice to be here um I have Clinic about half a day a week so I just rushed over from clinic but um I think I'm supposed to uh tell an inspirational story and I think I have one um I'll prepare you for the fact that what I'm about to show you by no means expresses the depth and breadth and capabilities of ccmb but I think it's a nice story and example of how ccmb has really focused on one problem solved it innovated it and done so in a way that's actually touching real impatient care and I think is really making a difference nationally and perhaps internationally and I'll I'll show you the story so we're going to take a brief uh brief course into here into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis these are inflammatory bow diseases I'm a gastr neurologist by training but I have background in image analysis biostatistics and Immunology and some for training there so I'll tell you a little story here about how ccmb is really making an impact in these diseases um this is the only talk I've ever given where I've started with a quote but I like this one because I think it's relevant it's from Mr Gates he says without feedback from precise measurement Innovation is doomed to be rare and erratic but with it Innovation becomes common place and you know part of my research program in the clinical and translational Space is really about measurement how can we come up with better ways to measure diseases from a molecular perspective as well as from a macroscopic and even population perspective and find ways to use data science to integrate that top to bottom right and precision medicine which we've been talking about for 30 years now is really only going to become a reality when we start making Precision measurements and I think that's one of the things that many of us are doing in all of our domains um in medicine as well as in other biological sciences so IBD okay so this is principally a condition that affects the colon maybe this is the wrong timing around lunch but but bear with me um this is a picture of what normal colon looks like normal intestine it should look similar to the palm of your hand right but these inflammatory bow diseases are condition of aggressive immunologic response which we believe has to do with immune tolerance more than autoimmunity and this is what your colon looks like when you have ulcerative colitis where you have an aggressive immune response that ultimately damages a superficial mucosa and we have a very deep understanding of this from a microbiologic standpoint a genetic and transcriptional standpoint as well as from an immune response standpoint and there's a cousin condition Crohn's disease right which they are related but the molecular functions are very different this is typically more of a th2 response um and the the human level impact of that is much deeper penetration into the tissues plus more systemic effects um because of cyto kind storms as well as differential response to to microbes so for a patient this can be as minor of it gives me a bad day and I have certain certain food intolerances or it can be completely life-altering totally debilitating and in some cases deadly although fortunately that's much more rare so this is what I've spent my life so far kind of working on I'm 43 so hopefully I have a lot more time but the way that we assess this I show you pictures from a colonoscopy those are still images and this is the primary means by which we assess these diseases right and for all s and this is true for many different conditions where we use some kind of Imaging as a primary macroscopic phenotypic assessment of the disease right this is the mayos score which was developed in 1979 at Mayo Clinic and it takes ulcerative kitis and turns it into four degrees of severity this is a lyer scale normal mild mod to severe they put numbers on it so that they can claim it's quantitative but it's really like just a categorical description right frankly this is pretty low Tech but this is the only thing that medicine's been able to do to come up with some kind of system that's works and is reproducible but we use this for everything staging the patient and phenotyping them determining how much therapeutic response there is giving them their prognosis and probably most f is the fact that this is what Regulators use the FDA and the EMA they use this as the primary means to figure out is a drug effective or not and increasingly insurance companies and payers are using these scales to figure out does a patient have access to a certain type of therapy will we continue paying for their biologic and small molecule therapy based on this score but there's a lot to be desired from this right and there's a ton of problems with this even when you have experts there's an enormous amount of disagreement because as all of you can understand these are qualitative assessments like if we go back to these images it's hard for me to tell and I do this all day what is the line between mild and moderate right and that concept can be whatever you want so the ways that we've tried to CH address these bias problems subjectivity problems and expert disagreement are to spend a ton of money on what's called Central reviewers so we're supposed to send our colonoscopy videos to some unbiased blinded human who allegedly is an expert at doing this that's right literally blind in many many ways in many ways but I'm trying to be nice I'm trying to be nice farma spends a fortune on this payers are now demanding that we do this and I send my colonoscopy video to Blue Cross Blue Shield or United Healthcare to for them to tell me how severe the patient is and make a major determin for the patient so this simple score this simple thing has enormous impact for the over 1 million patients in North America that have these conditions not to mention the money the money is a whole another story but I'll just tell you it's a lot and our ways to try to solve this are just unfeasible and untenable so here's the background here's the problem this is my entry point in 2018 this is a little story of ccnb this is my entry point to ccnb and I'm I have a little bit of knowledge John image analysis for that's a story we won't get into now but can we use data science and just at this point convolutional neural networks and other artificial neural networks are starting to become available they're starting to begin to enter into the clinical domain but there's still not a lot of expertise on the GPU access isn't there so it's really small pockets of knowledge the ccmb of course had that knowledge they were way ahead already for them this was 2010 technology and they're like why are you bothering us with this but I'm like humor because I think that there's there's there's some legs here so we take this is what ccnb is supposed to do right take the clinical expertise with a little bit of translational science knowledge and combine it with the breadth and depth of Technical and methodologic Innovation that's possible in ccnb bring these people together and really try to make impacts on maybe a small scale and in some cases a very large scale so this was my entry point I was nice enough to meet Kavon he's like yeah yeah yeah sure Ryan we'll figure this out this is simple but no problem and it's it's turned into a great relationship and friendship that um I'm incredibly um grateful for but a big team of people on both sides so what do we do we started simply I'm going to blow through this part because this is old hat to everybody but in 2016 2017 2018 neural networks no one knew what what I was talking about when I put my clinical hat on and I'm like you got to trust me this is the way to go so more or less we pump a bunch of images in we get a couple take a couple humans reviewers they take a year to manually annotate all these images for the severity we train a CNN no big deal in 2023 but then this was a big deal and we came up with a model that could take still images and give us a predicted probability of what's the Mayo score here so you've got some automated standardized nonbiased method for grading disease I'm not spending money I don't have to worry about the expertise of the individual we all know this now this is old hat but this is where we were then and suffice it to say we were able to show that our simple system based on 20,000 images which runs of course Very quickly matched the agreement for imageo image agreement of paired expert humans that are getting paid about $600 per colonoscopy video to review this so from just a financial standpoint this was huge but we showed this I was surprised as made a big impact because I didn't think that it was that big of a deal but the field was the field was really interested in this but these were just still images I could build the neural networks at this point I could put the CNN together frankly I'm just stealing code on GitHub that was work but that's how kind of coding is at this point but we needed to go further and this is where the knowledge and impact of all of us in this community really came to play when we look at real world video video and motion analysis is really a complicated thing this is a still image from a colonoscopy and you're like oh well I don't know what that is because I'm not a doctor you don't know what this is because this is nothing this is the camera bumped up against the tissue most of the colonoscopy most of medical video in fact a lot of ctmr endoscopy laparoscopic video is noise is useless and just distinguishing noise from not noise is a huge problem and so the next year we said how do we adjust for these real world distractors right and this now become more more complicated we did not use VHS but um more or less throw it back to the old days but we're getting increasingly sophisticated and this is all you know through kon's lab and frankly a lot of Kavon students who work very closely uh with me clinically actually came and saw some colonoscopies and we really had a nice exchange of knowledge here and developed multiple neural network modules that were now interacting together prepr modules deidentification modules and informative image detectors to figure out is the image useful or not delete those images figure out other distractors we take a lot of biopsies and those biopsies often look just like an ulcer they look like disease but how do you distinguish whether or not what you're looking at is iatrogenic impact or is actual disease you have to build subsystems to do this pardon me iatrogenic yes oh I'm sorry iatrogenic meaning that is the damage you see from um something that the clinician did or the operation did or is it native disease does that work y yeah okay so ultimately we're making slow progress in 2019 here we're now we're finding ways to try to get these neural networks to talk to each other and come up with a whole video of predictive endoscopic score and this was a lot of work from Heming Yao who um has graduated but did a a lot of hard work on this and she led most of this effort um and ultimately we were able to build a fully automated video analysis system for Endoscopy which nearly matched the review review capability of paired Central reviewers so this was really doing the a professional level expert work on full motion video regardless of the source so this led to a number of Publications and in fact two of our Publications got stand alone editorials for the space because they were really recognizing that these small impacts in data science and particularly image analysis are making a huge impact in clinical medicine and really changing things so everybody's excited about this in the clinical space we're providing reliability efficiency and speed lower cost frankly eliminating the cost and giving uniform non-biased measurements Precision medicine really we're giving you the right kind of measurement the same reproducible measurement all the time the field is thrilled with this Kon and I were not satisfied because we felt we could do better if we think about these Mayo scores and you can extrapolate this to lots of other medical conditions it's four levels right but it's even simpler than this the FDA and the EMA they consider zero and one to be the same they consider two and three to be the same and these this type of construct is similar and on ology and many other disease States transplant medicine where they have to bend these conditions into very coarse measurements but there's so much granularity and detail here that's being thrown out we felt that Michigan had the opportunity to really innovate in this space and come up with new ways to measure disease think of these situations here's a patient and this is a colonoscopy graphic where most of their colon is severe compare them this patient where they also have severe disease in mayo3 but only a portion of the Colon's involved are these two patients the same are current measurement says they're identical but they're not what about if you have two patients who have a therapeutic Improvement on treatment but the distribution changes are they the same and what if you have a mixture of different disease compositions and this may be severity grade or it may be phenotype grade this may be true at the macro level but it also may be true at a histologic or even a multiomic level but you need to be able to parse out that granularity so this is what we worked on we're failing the field has been failing for 40 years to really quantify this disease and we thought with data science we could really make an impact but this part was going to be hard we had to innovate the complete structure of how we look at this and principally to be able to come up with a methodology using image analysis other metadata to try to get some kind of localization or Geographic specification of where are we more or less a spatial mapping of disease and not just what the grade of disease is but what are the different features of disease are there ulcers there what's the hystology at those segments what are even the genetic and transcriptional signatures at those segments so this is just a slide to basically say it's complicated right that's all we need to know um at least all I need to know um I did pretty well in mathematics but I I had a limit at discreet math I I can follow this but we didn't write it but we work together on this methodology for spatial M macroscopic spatial information and then translated this together where I worked with bioengineering here as well and brought them into the game to try to come up with invivo sensors to give us location data for the patient now it was course because the technology is not quite there yet for ultrasound and Laser capture and RFID inside of PTI but what this is is taking the the new methodologies that we develop together mapping the predicted path of the colon and then the actual path in blue the red is predicted the blue is the ground truth and over several models we got really close and what ultimately this translated to is a completely new way to assess inflammatory bow disease we take endoscopic video and we perform multiple different levels of computer vision analysis frame level pre-train networks for severity classification and disease features and combining that with the positional location estimation which is completely Innovative and new and really there was nothing in the literature about this so I can confidently say we invented something and this is what we're using now and we are now pitching this to the field and we call the cumulative disease score so this is something real it exists it's out there and in my small little world of gastro neurology we're really making an impact and we're space ially mapping this is an example of spatially mapping the disease severity for the patient but we can also overlay all kinds of other things the histology the omix from the biopsies that are collected both transcriptional as well as protein and even microbial signatures that can get mapped spatially so we can understand how these things interact and all leveraging existing data science so what has been the impact here pretty huge we partner with Johnson and Johnson on live clinical trials with them and what we've shown is that using our score we're informing the entire clinical trials community that the buckets that they've put patients into for severity are really limited and their results really need to change so in clinical trials these are mayos scores normal mild monitor severe and in a clinical trial you assume if you have a Mayo 2 or three that all those patients are the same they all go in the same bucket of active these patients are inactive and what we're able to show them is all these patients that are screening into your trial they have a huge mixture of the amount and severity of total disease in the colon on a per patient level so in this bucket there's a spectrum of patients sure so these are these are traditionally severe patients mayo3 but this red here in that bucket sure about 40% of these patients match up with our scores being severe but look at the distribution there's so much heterogenea in this population and this has a lot of impact for drug development so we're replacing conventional scores like these mayo tws and threes of severity with our cumulative disease score which is giving so much higher resolution and informing drug development at a far earlier phase they're seeing signals now in Phase One 2030 patients that they could never see before because data science is providing the granularity new metrics for IBD it's completely quantitative it's explainable and traceable you know getting a lot of you know some of Brian's comments on generative Ai and some of the needs for traceability trustworthiness evidence we can provide that and we're capturing more of the Physicians assessment when we show this to the doctor that performed the colonoscopy they have no questions they're like that's exactly what I saw so this scans well with the clinical experience this is some of the impact that we're having in clinical trials this is um as I'm sure you all know this is just a um a power calculation a power plot done for the purpose of sample size estimation and clinical trials using traditional Mayo scores this is your power curve that we've had for 30 years using the new score that we developed here you gain so much power that in multiple randomized control trials we've shown with our score you can detect the same degree of clinical and therapeutic difference with half of the patients cut the cost of the trial in half speed up drug development by by years right and also get a go noo decision on if your asset is worthwhile very early but we're even moving past that taking this type of CDs data and this is some work from uh uh Christian where we're taking this data inputting it with clinical metadata and actually from the screening colonoscopy predict ing what is your likelihood in 52 weeks of having a therapeutic response before the drug goes in the patient you can actually tell prospective subjects based on your characteristics this is your pre-test probability of having a response to this drug and if you go on Placebo we can figure that out even more and then we're implementing this real world so what excites me the most is that these data science Innovations with all the work together in ccnb we're able to push this out to touch patients shown you clinical trials but we're actually doing this in clinical practice now so at all of our indas sites with the University of Michigan actually have something called access which is our automated Cron's and colus scoring system where we are passively with no clinician touch capturing all this endoscopic video pushing it to it to a server that sits in Domino farms and this is just running in the background all the time so this objective standardized reproducible data is available to clinicians right now so we're really solving a lot of problems in IBD where ultimately by taking a lot of Innovations and image analysis combining that with new types of modeling such as um fuzzy Neal networks we're really getting better answers for patients and trying to predict things um in the future because we're doing more precise measurements that match up with the patient so I think that this is a small story but a good kind of inspirational kickoff story for cc MB because I think we've got the right people here we've got The Perfect Blend of clinical and translational scientists with Innovative methodologists and um that that span a spectrum of biologic Sciences data sciences and computational medicine and when you take that plus all the tools that we have at Michigan that's really special I think that we're finding the right Solutions so it's been great to talk to you all and um I hope I hope you all have great stories like this to provide next year so Ryan that was fantastic and I hasten to say that I bet it will be memorable for this entire audience thank you so much and is it okay if we uh put the recoring in the website maret I can come to you it's like it's showing them old right yeah welcome Ryan now I just I don't really have a detailed questions I just have a comment for since we are having a ccmb crowd here is I think your talk Illustrated why we went from one mstp student every two to four years to now having four or five mstp students in the program we used to be not so popular for mstp because we don't say oh all the classes you took in Medical School are similar to what we are teaching therefore you can go straight into the work and don't have to take classes which is what CMB and human genetics and many of the other programs do we ask them to do programming uh linear algebra all of these good things that are nothing like what they are taught in medical school but we now have a pretty good class of mstp students who are interested at exactly that face and are doing taking the same classes as our students and are doing well in the program I think one of them is also called Ryan so uh I think that that was just the comment thank you great sure go ahead so I understand why this is going to be really important for drug development and things like that but I still missing the clinician getting the information and choosing a therapy based on this Are We There Yet yeah well I think so I don't think hold it up just hold it up this works okay all right thank you both um I don't think that we're giving the clinician any necessarily huge insights what we're doing for them is we are Prov providing a quantitative means to justify their intuition in most situations so in our specialty we don't have the luxury of most of our patients having a complete response going from severe disease to totally normal so it's always some kind of increment and so the clinician is really interested in I appreciate there's been an incremental decline but hasn't been enough am I biased and imagining things because I want to continue treating the patient and and I think that the clinicians are all very aware of this but if we can arm them with quantitative data to substantiate their decision-making I think that's one arm of this but then the other arm is you know much like art we don't always understand why something is or is not art and we don't always understand at least myself why I think I should continue a patient on a therapy or why should we we should change and so this type of analytic output can help us understand more what is the phenotype or the quantitative description of patients that correlate with one who will have a positive course versus one who will have a negative course we're still learning because when you make a new metric um if you're if you're a proper methodologist it takes a lot of rigorous work and time to really understand if these are useful or not but we think it will be and certainly it feels excited but I appreciate your point and it's spot on question so I'm an oncology and I I totally like this is this is really powerful I'm a huge fan of higher resolution data right you have higher spatial resolution at multiple levels so I I love the work one of the things that we run into in oncology just with the clinicians and I and that's why I'm really interested to hear what what you see in GI whether it's you know different or the same is that we'll have new metrics we'll have new tool TOs and we'll say hey this can actually give you a better more precise right understanding in this case it's like we're predicting infection and imuno compromised patients um and then I get two responses so there's one group of people who's like oh yeah that makes total sense yeah I would like to know yeah there's a probability there yeah I'll integrate it into my day-to-day clinical work and there's another group of people and I'm not judging either of them but this is just observation that says well yeah that's probably good but you know where's the prospective randomized control trial that proves that this includes the outcomes and and all of that and I'm just sort of curious of of what your experience has been in the response to of of clinicians to the tool yeah so I I think there's two brief ways to answer that question because I don't want to take too much time what one of them is um granularity does not ensure that you make any better of a decision so when you apply these typ of tools um the quantitation is attractive but it might not matter so something that we're doing more of is applying to you know decision curve analysis to try to look at yes you have higher resolution data or more quantitation but how much of that information is actually impacting your decision if I'm going to send this patient to surgery regardless and it doesn't matter what I see then I don't even need a video like I can know nothing and guess surgery all the time for this kind of patient and my guess is as good as all this quantitation in the last five years of Kon and I's live um so I think that it's really important and increasingly in the clinical journals that work with AI and ml we want to see decision curve analyses um and this is actually something that um uh Vickers and Karen deep have uh Karen De sing have introduced me to which I think is a really useful way to look at it but then the the other part of is with the RCT the challenge with the rcts are that so much of our decision- making is already baked in before you get to these measures that we're finding it increasingly difficult to tease out those uncaptured nudges that push the clinician behaviorally to do one thing versus another so I think we just have so much work to do people are scared of generative AI I'm not worried about it because we're gonna have so much work to do figuring out how to analyze it and how to properly report it so that we know these things are useful or not yeah I totally agree I think the rcts are totally impractical for a lot of these things so I was just sort of curious like how you're you're handling it so thanks that I'm grateful for the FDA though because it's kind of like pumping the break so that we have some time to all catch up and I think they're stalling with the rcts and um not the smad space but RCT is oh randomized control trials randomized control trials okay listen this is great thank you very much thanks for the comments and questions let's now turn
