all right you haven't signed em there's a sign-in sheet I might bring it back with me but Diane before you leave don't stray again it and a research assistant after in generality burning specifically in this okay so I guess it's a late good morning everyone thank you for coming to my talk today yeah thanks for a nice introduction over the Marci so for some of you I think I already be Fred for years and I remember ten years ago remember really I came to my first credit patient also in this room and after I started my first job in the University of Michigan today and from the Chi call you can say I would like to talk about some research fundings using the big data at the multi onyx that who look at the microarray and the target genes interactions so before I it'll how could justice keyboard thank you yes before start a story I would like to give a little bit of background about the cancer first so everyone knows this name I think which is a very scared term and when people hear someone had a cancer and that's that's like really got Oh could it okay I'm going to die immediately so cancer actually the in the in the molecular levels really it's something that caused by uncontrolled division of abnormal cells so you relay in when the cell or divide divide itself and it goes to the very normal stage and the continuum dividing and grew the tissue and plays a normal function but the inter cancer that really had all the abnormal and caused a lot over continuous abnormal cells so the function of that cell is clay actually we're late so the cause some diseases so or here this is a part of the tissue here if you see this area or this is a really really like cancer cell TV division area so you can see the difference between the cancer area at the normal area so are many years ago and people know this and but it's a really hard to fan out of why and like the National Institute of Health specifically the NCI on National Cancer Institute and NHGRI National Human Genome Research Institute we know that's where the human genome what sequence the first and place and so they are initiate a project called that he's a DEA or the Cancer Genome Atlas so this project actually try to sequence the many cancer individuals and also has their normal match are the sequence to try to determine or characterize the the cancer signature for me and they're going to conduct this through their nectar or sequencing technology because and like many years ago we don't have that technology and so this project actually has sequins the more than 30 cancer type and subtypes and now their data publicly available to the community and so therefore the level one for some addition or like detailed data you have to request access through the NIH portal site - so here are specific cancer cards and they are dating information and we can see each cancer Piper has abbreviation and also foo names that these are kids is shifted by their other the center and also there are actually final case is available for for each cancer type and as you can see this was mainly conducted in and finished in 2016 which is three years ago so this is a continue for the cancer type and as we can state disk hours and multiple cancers and the air almost every area in the body has be determined some are have a lot of cases and some are don't have and that this is the depend of a lability that this project is actually across the nation so another background information I would like to give is MRA or message re and microarray and I think everyone here are familiar with this MRA terminology and the full name is a messenger rebo nuclear and state and this is this is actually the prescription product of the gene or DNA so and I think through their of re polymeric you have machinery so the microarray or the me re and this is actually also re but it's a small and the full name is a micro our rainbow nuclear the ants eat so this microarray is not something our be used for translation and rather than that I played a very important roles in doing the post transcriptional regulation - specifically this is are are actually the smari which binds to the three prime untranslated regions of the message RA - plays roles so how micro is generated a it is a very long process and I so I just here give a brief overview about the major process so the microarray URL it could be like generate leaders through their intron intergenic region and this one will be under there are a polymeric use help as well so the first part of the forms that are including the stem loop structure is called a pre micro right the PRI and thereafter that this product will be a continued be processed by the machinery coltd Rasha Rasha and will remove these connections and the generate another product that called the Premack Rory so the PR e now so and this one also has supplies immune Bob here everything here stab happens in the nucleus so after this a process that the pre microarray will be transported out chip from nucleus into the cytoplasm and the starter plasm this is the area that happens in we know the translation also later or happens for the MRA so so here this happens through directs 14:5 help and it could come to the here there's another process the rule called the machinery called the kaiser so this was cut off the stem loop and the P comma B come out to straddle complex so only once thread will be kept the other shredder will be degraded so they're the one that keeps either will form that accorded the RA induced I think the color there a small complex so this one has like see the region together and that they bonded to the 3-prime utr plays a function some cons and you will have the translational repression for the MRI and it called a partial complementary and the perfect the complement is sometimes it has you know like doing the MRI irritation so MRI network be translation so Michael why we study microwave because the microarray the expression actually has the change there from normal to diseases all including humor stage and so so so this actually has to be discovered many years ago we know some of aberrant micro expression has the associate with many type of cancers here is just an example on lung cancer or the heart failure as well so this will happen so in particular micro expression all therefore we was to identify the additional microwaves in our human body and that you see if there's also associate with the certain diseases or cancers and a wowser actually made your challenging is how we produce this and how we identify this actually should put others first identify that the product I said so many actually are computational approaches happy actually employed to study this and why is a wiser I think it's a very popular one the people talked about the clustering things because in the network we was to see how this microarray connected targeted MRA or these genes so previously clustering for this microarray gene expression data actually really focus or the microarray the expression theta because what first is a NGS technologies are not available very early and the second is the not many data actually available to Ana - however there are all these studies actually are not enough especially we want to look at the complexity of the change of the correlation coefficient at the expression value of speed feel mercury and an MRI on target pairs and moreover when we look at the tumor at the normal sample simultaneously and there's really not a not a single study even to do that and so unfortunately we have that he's idiot data to compare that and so so we was to develop a some you know wait here by informatica tools or method to cluster this interaction pairs and into functional modules and that we want to visualize their interaction why will consider the both cases simultaneously so this is the figure actually demonstrate a a very general how McCrory McCrory and incorrect or target it's a Mari so from this why it's very simple by apartheid graph right the left is the MRA list and the right is the micro release as we can see why my query could the target on more than one MRI and the why my memory could be targeted by more than one microwave so they secrete a very complete the network and how we can classify that or grouping them so to do these things we was to make a hot positive but the hypothesis and between humor the normal samples and the microarray and its target here MRE they are errors or their Col correlation coefficient or anti or and highlighting in the opposite direction we caught an accurate here that means in tumor samples their relation could be positive but in normal samples will be the negative at the vice-versa so to do so we need to apart by and the processing from the raw sequencing data and here which this so this is a very I mean sir come consuming steps and about we summarizing into six major steps and when the TCG take one sin theta were actually provided by the by the NIH they already have a wrong sequencing data many of us here knows how to reprocess NGS data start from the fescue files right that those things are same here and to really really when we doing this a TCGA project actually has some part I already be up colitis through the re white kurta like the expression calling and also there they have some how to read corridor rpkm available for us to use however there's a very messy and that we have to do a uniform staff the one we did is that we first download that is the post microarray and AMR expression files for all cancer types into a local server and there we can buy this samples for microarray and MRI to make four files and so for tumor we have a microexpression file and for the also for the MRI expression same thing for the normal so we need to combine these things that we are doing to those days begin to order all the samples for who make correct for these when we calculate the correlation between microarray and MRI and also we download some database prediction result for the targeting information locally at the to check each pair make sure they have a target relationship at least the computationally predicted so so so so then there are we also recalculated the transcript premiering to make a consistent because P for the sequences that are generated different normalization result I think many many fetishists here knows that we was to do a uniform for these things that will also deal some basic statistical calculation like me media P fer values in order to make sure the resulted at which a potato are statically significant there we will look at the post tumor normal samples we can buy them in two side-by-side format to make sure and we can compare them and they'll be analyzed differentially expressed the MRI and a microwave pairs between tumor at the normal samples so on this column and everyone can see here and it has a lots of different command some other unix command some other executable and some other are scripts some other poor or some other you know parsing or some java things because this is a project I was actually completed in my former lab the students at some have this the program your skills some has that so but finally we put it together into a poplar like this and so see here are specific how we did for the cluster identification we saw like a she actually so the legion is my former PhD student they did a significant the microarray anime my repairs help with many other student help and shinchon and who is undergrad student just graduated last December and now working the Facebook and that he did a cluster scoring algorithm doing that cluster detection the dr. JA who is the faculty at the school public health here D the statistical significance at once and for the calculations well so another are mr. Baker who is the IT specialist er he's a very very very reputed server-side and did some visualization coding for the owner of the flap server which I'm going to damage a second so the one was one positive control that we used for very that our result is a gene is a fgfr3 the funny needs fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene at this gene has been recorded or identified to the associate with plastic Collider cancer so this is the information from the from the table if we magnify this and also it's a car get you I am a curious mirror 100 and so we can see the food to change your father fgfr3 in the tumor is higher and the microarrays targeting microarrays the extraction is the lower in the tumor because microarrays suppresses fgfr3 expression in the normal but in the tumor and it's opposite so so yes and when we look at the correlation between humour the normal it also goes update and in that humor is negative and the normally the positive and so so that this is the p-value FDR value and also significant and when we look at our target relationship at a two out of three well new target prediction databases like target profiler and Amira either reported that you have targeted relationship so this is a positive control what do we say that now this is the Wilder figure actually generated by our server to look at their correlations between de are targeting the macro a hundred and fgfr3 genes the horizontal axes are the samples and the vertical axis is the expression level so for the scoring algorithm we actually employ the modified the lluvia algorithm so this one is actually very popular community detection algorithm at using a greedy optimization method and i to optimize the modularity of a partition of the network to the fork function that would be finder for this algorithm either we based on the microwave voltage in sorry the MRI a photo change at the microwave photo change and we we just take all the available voltage induced for the in the a cluster and Summerall them and also we considered their correlations between tumor and the normal and so by the way this is to first to other know the information and the third part is ages information when we calculated the score there we assign a score to each a cluster or each community after we run these things so you know in the algorithm self we also incorporated some statistics and to do some like significance the calculation so basically we if we have a cluster for example identify like these three genes three microarrays connect like this and that everything this is a cluster and that we just are randomized is by shuffling the ages and the calculated the significance after we get the number of their cluster scores greater than the one that whatever we reported a stake and II thinking to see how many are out of total shuffle II other simulation steps so these are very routine result and getting the how many are micro Rory and the mRNA pairs with universe correlation for the all the cancers for example for plc we have a 998 number of pairs and when we consider they're also opposite the photo change between humor and normal samples we reduced numbers em to the 578 because this is a Mesa perhaps a nice additional information for for for disappears not just at how correlated they also expressions are opposite so the relationship between in the third columns why is that including the second economy including both the opposite of owed to change and the same time hopefully change by the third economy is only opposite the function yes yes so this is a this is how many communities affected for all the available cancers we have studied and also there there's a significant the class or face or the FDR where you port one cut off and as we can see this is another consistent across because the number of the hepatic cluster is not always a sushi with number of significant the clusters okay this is another observation about the cluster size because when the Louie overs and detect the clusters some are big some are more that we arrange them into increasing order from there how many clusters detected and also cluster size and will be the vertical and specifically there are at least the number of clusters the for the hell you ad PRC in cancer which are two DB cancer data said in the TCG a portal and there are the Li HS see this this is the cancer actually has a lot of the or the most clusters but the cluster size is not that I've had big as L you ad at the BRCA and but we do have a one big cluster for l rh t in which we use the for the further study so from this or distribution we also see the cluster score distribution and the Lu ad at the PRC again close to the very high cluster score at LHC is not in that low but it also somewhere here and this is the observation for the result and any questions so far we use a P by the formula here okay yeah we consider the expression for both the target gene or my Mari and the microarray and also their ages yeah that one we have to look at the supplementary table we just take that as arbitrary ones because we don't want to that's either lose a lot of a biological meaningful ones and the soda so the one that actually has very very high ones and actually you know there could also be something biological meaningful and oh yeah we just haven't included everything for the further study any other questions okay so now it's come to the spared about the web tool that associated with this detection things and I will do a demo a finish the slides so the web to the website look like this okay we have a page upload options here user care to their own file and we also have some sample files here can select each cancer and of course the into the format that has certain themes it's all the website that talk about what's the columns and there we can do some parameter future relations which is on the left of hand a top part and this is a tell what kind of information we only want to see here to be civically we have their like absolute of those change like mr a mark where you want to see how big that both changes steps that you want kinda those have a correlation range we also have data based prediction like a selection one two or three and also there are normalizing expression range for MRA microarray and here and we have they're also available if you want to see some additional things about you want to see after upload you want to only see the node that you are interested in or subset you are just eating after select now you just reset the graph go back the second parent here on the left side is the cluster calculation which basically called the modify the movie algorithm on the server to calculation that the user can get the result through the running our server here actually also you can select how many runs are types of the simulations you want to perform one 1,000 or 10,000 a hundred thousand the long the lobby girl you want to run and if a longer calm you take therefore there is an email you could food and the instead of honey or the server when you finish like a battery or you just close the window data stop and I rather than you want to put the email you get a link download and the third part has visualizations things and you want to just to see what's the p value or koo value cut off the subset cluster pilot they look at your interesting pairs okay as we can see this tools also has the some additional selections by writing click each node in the summer marker is some are MREs and we have a summer additional functional annotation information here which I also do your just a second and that tells some additional annotation so okay so our this is the justice stamps and I think I will not adjust average through days and the rather that we can look at the details and the to the parameter interval resist Asian and that we could also do a search here and copy us intricity jeans on Mike Lawrence just that he was sent her them at the UK just realized that easily and again so when you do the calculation for the cluster step and you was to actually upload your file first let's select that at the later on and you could download that also to visualize it and the one thing I want to mention about the cluster realization is the sort of graph for the visualization what we use actually the technology uses nodejs application I think some of you here are very good in this visualization things there may be comments whether this is the best technology because the so far we encounter a little bit the issue is that I will show you just second is that when we have uploaded the whole graph especially the beginning part the know that the ages will move everywhere it's very hard to control that so we can get a comments feedback and see how do you improve that and we have the ages as we said ages also represent a detail the information not just the connections also the thinking is at a collar everything tells their different meanings and we use different shape represented the either MRA or the microwave and as I mentioned we have a cluster of view function and according to the q-value cutoff and there I think a user causal collapse the expanded the legend and the some days it just like costume attic features another things I want to mention is databases into a grid forward who and are listed here and for the microwave socially database we have the HM DD and a similar mirror which is also look at the target changing due to a variant and also mirror base everyone heard this is a database before the microarray sequence and annotation that we have you incorporate this information to another very common information and data basically in card it's a cake pathway it's a look at the pathway in warm and the father microarray and also you know and we could link this to the mr as well for the genes as well so for the MRA we have David and that's the very well know database for functional annotation look at it go terms information and another things that we have there is cosmic and a look at the somatic mutations in cancers because we use the example cancer sequence data as as a data set we want to look at some cancer specific and also cancer hope this is one look at the passive form and a you know immunology information for those how the microarray and gene could be a sushi is that that and again same thing for the cake I already mentioned that so this is a magnified the screenshot for the tool and I thinking instead over looking at this and I would you to leave damage so this is the one to catch why yes okay so the first things that I guys said and when I uploaded for example sample file this is a this is the interaction pairs and they come to the come to the visualization and that if you look at the legend here at the circle is the microarray and the square is amre if you see this collar the connection for the father for the ages and the you will see this is a normal because the for each pair we have a tumor relationship at the normal relation at the tip and other arkanese for this database of prediction that arm is the more database more database of prediction validation for the relationship and also thinking is about the correlations like Ronnie's and that the thinker will get higher and the thinner will get lower so so so yeah this looked like a hairball I know many protein-protein interaction databases also like this but this is the normal this is why we need to develop a pause to to look at that so if you click this manual borrow the car upper corner and you can do tutor you know tools and link there and you could also go to the tutorial page and we have all this step-by-step information listed here and if you click the about and this is just the one house or what do we do that we just need to put the publication out there and then let's go back to home and let's reload this and so if you see there is a very small double areal daughter middle area in the left card and this is it means something you can click come out a window and you can't do something here so if you was to get those a functions you click this drop down menu come up like three pairs I just mention there so for example if you want to send her gene and we just look at her if he ever 3 if you click Center it will show up somewhere here we flash it and if you keep clicking this it's moving here moving here okay so for this gene if you wants to see that name if you position the mouse here you'll see there there is a label there okay so when you screw your mouse or triangle you could get her you know a closer daeso validation so this is gene actually you can say for example this is you and if you want to put this keep this sitting there there are the photo changes between why the steak pitting wine of two you need to select this between why the five and this gene would highlight either keep there because the filter change is still meets the creature rear the database of prediction that they kept it to you because because because I am are a microarray data getting there where that's not not select one part the other part will be gothic yeah now you go back there and tell you he wants to keep there was the gene names you click the MRI show the gene label and so there's the circles are not being sued and if you click this button it will mark or a label will also be listed so you could continue to you know starting more and for example the one that has like this this is a mirror 100 and because mirror 100 did in the past that expression for the chin to cut off at the beginning but now to go back and if you was to remove note and still here we've got to the lack of there now you keep this database prediction the two and the so the others were faded you can remove note the others gone just keep this and still moving sorry nobody was told later off and so this one that were at this stage if you were to study some additional things for this appear the review clicks there you know right click these things you pop out HM DD and to where this information will show there is another area you click this bar come out you could just maybe issue this one nothing I know Katie they do another show there and if you watch to see Sumeria an impatient for this microarray this information will show everything or the bottom we have all these columns to parse out from the database that are downloaded from there and for this for this table you could download to your local computer by cilenti which format you would like see as we excel PDF and so when you click this it will ask you to you know open or download and so it will come out it will come up this information and you could download and so another things either will be your base Amira base as I said is a visa for micro notation it also you can't get this that helps you there are sequences self microwave and mature or ID and also sequence and so if you have a more than one rules it will shows more multiple pages and for the gene you can do right click and you can stay like David and somehow this one is not have get better information download it and also there are cosmic you could have selected a cosmic attendant tells you this is this is fgfr3 gene who named at a location and tells the humor humor associations the bladder and some other you know the information also identity but everything I know they did here it come from the cosmic database and so another thing is answered better enter tope connection it's a detailed search so this Y is a link to that catered to the website and so you gather you can continue to work on this place and wait here that close that step further search out or that or this much yeah oh okay here okay that's right here we go thank you yes so for this long and that we could also link to the last part here or the click this go back cake so this one will tells you if this information is available here and so little dealer no drag yeah no I can click this a little bit on there you'll see that bar that but the EP you do click this one the fgfr3 at the interview link to the king pathway website directly navigate you to this fgfr3 link and this is a plant or cancer to see the pathway here it's a clay the rules here there are yes so if you were to are let's see you finish this and you just close this doing here and so now after we finish the visible addition feature and then if we want to cluster calculation again you do the standing off out by browsing your window or you see you see sample you into the file which is the one that we already through what here and you can click selection I don't care you can put your email here number of runs you want to let's say because it takes the long time if you do too many maybe 100 times only you click a crease the crit cluster but here is that the file upload your successfully just waiting and then do you want to see the submission history it will here is most likely already finished it's the we are so finished and you could open that and the cluster result this is what how's the cluster result and what's the cluster cluster size like how many genes had my corner is and also the score I think dollars the the score or calculation and this is the p-value this is the key value this is a specific Jing at micro RNA pairs inside a cluster if you want to start the score and think go here do you start and so so if you want to do the decreasing order and just select enter okay so now you have the you know largest the largest cluster score is the three hundred own I and you have smaller so there you were to dismiss list and go back and if you were to do the visualization here and then this one is pre computed the result up tutor and thousand times that you can see visualization and that if we use a rh stay at the example and the cutoff would you know maximum wah this is only law available and this is the community index the 67th but in order to show this one you have to first load this first and then do that selection because this is a bigger cluster and still if you was to that's a reload this agency and this is the one only want a significant here and then eat this cutoff and if you do another big ones and the RC wants this is the biggest one I like haribol like this I'm glad this the computer server can still upload this and so so light here you through the BRC see you have a motive whole clusters detected and if you clearly want OD is only the one that associate is there if you select another one if you can see the changes and all those want all your show that a cool ally or solution is that that community has been detected so yeah by changing this you could do that and think you finally when you're finished you don't want to gather this a lot a strategy that you just click this again make this one and together the interesting things you know continue to look at that yeah I think that's why I want to show for the to today the running of the kind either we're still there in the in the summary and so we we actually look at all the literature's and the so far this is a actually only want to consider they're like anti correlations for their interaction for the tumor and almost ample tools to look kinda macro and MRI and the specific our tool can calculated let's see the interactions and the clustering them and finally and visualize that and so we also have their database for the functional annotations into a great healing in our tool which is a very convenient for the researchers to look at the downstream analysis or annotation and those so part of the case is that we actually look at is a TCGA dataset for the public by the end the killings are like a what what's the big significance association for each cancer of genes about the users and welcome to try their or old data sent and this will give us a additional opportunity for them to try our - that also gives an addition of a biological interpretation for their dataset so yeah I think finally I want to acknowledge my students and colleagues and think couple colleagues are here on campus and student I think to already graduate he that who are high school student also prove height as some helps get it get the experience and so this is a paper actually just published last month at the genes Journal and so welcome to read that be happy to answer questions so I think the common restriction I still have a something going on by the Navy stop here to answer some questions you would if I can though thank you for coming [Applause] doesn't seem to have any verification extends yes so uh so we are 20 just a more defined at a Louie because the Louie has B does it be proven in the question here this is why we need to base all the customer without we need to continue to look at some additional an impatient rather than just from those pairs the one thing is we look at the summer changing so for example after migrate for example we we've reported the targeting for example five genes and then the five genes were could also be you know or targeted by another marker let me look at them together I look here there for example Cancer Association or some additional expression things and just a good idea and also another another things where what you're working on it's a look at new patient you the 3-prime utr side because that will gives evidence where they're migratory targeting genes what but the quarter relative to the previous selection gives like continued of her hydration thing and so from that three prime UTR the target relationship will get in that whether this the targeting due to that aberrant change is obtained or the lost so this is this is just addition Oh which are work to do yes your algorithm it was considering only micro RNA binding in the 3-prime utr I think yeah we we rely on the three database of prediction algorithm or leather target scale anything yes and and indeed another future work we want you to include you some additional target prediction tools I know there are some people renowned sir actually also try to compare different like experimentally validated targets I like diana tools are delayed called a car base and that's it also something we want to add and and adding to a notation to further further future specific and context and i think you have a unique data set because you have multiple cancer types so i just wondering if you started sharing the interactions that you identified her cancer type i and also help validate yeah yeah i think that's a very good suggestion but though i think it i think it definitely definitely there you'd be very cool to have that comparison yeah and we do have a some cancer comparison are actually result in publishing the paper we actually look at how they're how the difference between the clustering and also their like how their resole addition different across those cancers TCGA so what do we what do we actually do these are week that define some like how many target a step from my own currently together let's see another my query for this cancer compared to the how many strengthen the other other cancer and so this tells the whether it's a theoretic are getting or the additional character give you and we compared but there you're the sound hybrid or some additional specific things if you're including that that would add value introduces some additional discussion how we compare them so yes we do have this sort of things and reported in the you know actually that they're actually in the in the paper I think that's very good point yeah any other questions [Applause]
