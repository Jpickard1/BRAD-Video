so our next speaker is dr kristen perrington kristen if you want to go and share your slides okay great um so dr perrington is an assistant professor at wayne state university in the carmonas cancer center she received her master's in statistics and phd in epidemiology from the university of michigan in 2010 and in a post-doctoral fellowship in health sciences research at the mayo clinic our current research focuses on mainly on er positive and her2 negative breast cancer and colorectal cancer and racial disparities in them much of her research utilizes data and biospecimens from the detroit research on cancer survivors or rocks cohort study which is an nci-funded prospective cohort study of african americans recently diagnosed with breast prostate colorectal and lung cancers her talk title today is area level socioeconomic disadvantage and racial disparities in cancer and metropolitan detroit um so i'll go ahead and hand it over to you kristin thanks thanks thanks so much maureen excuse me i'm losing my voice a little bit here but um yeah i'm really excited to talk to you all today about some of the work that we've been doing um in detroit and to start us off um i want to take a second to talk about the cancer experience specifically in metropolitan detroit and and specifically racial disparities in cancer in metro detroit specifically so i am a kci in detroit which is situation situated in southeast michigan here um but the kci catchment area actually consists of 46 counties throughout the state of michigan because we now have i think it's 15 different satellite locations throughout michigan um but most of what i'm going to be talking about today is going to be focusing on data coming out of southeast michigan um again where kci detroit is located and this graph on the right is really showing um highlighting the racial and ethnic minority populations that are most predominant in our catchment area of southeast michigan um so you can see that overwhelmingly um the most predominant racial and ethnic minority population in southeast michigan um is black or african americans so that's going to be the focus of much of what i'm going to be talking about in the context of racial disparities today so um we can take a closer look at geographic and racial differences in cancer incidence and mortality specifically in in metro detroit particularly compared to how that looks sort of uh based on the experience in the united states overall so in the graph on the left um if we actually first just take a look at the comparison between cancer incidence and mortality rates in southeast michigan compared to the united states so southeast michigan is in the um sort of darker bars here and the united states overall is in the green bars but you can see that generally speaking um there's actually higher incidence and higher mortality for most of these common cancer sites in southeast michigan compared to the united states overall and that effect is actually even more exaggerated when we specifically look at cancer incidence and mortality in the city of detroit where you can see these really striking differences particularly for prostate cancer and lung cancer um for both incidence and mortality so excuse me you might be thinking um knowing that um residents of detroit are predominantly african-american how does this actually translate to racial differences in in cancer incidence mortality and um it sort of plays out how you would expect um excuse me where you are seeing that we have um higher incidence rates for higher incidence and mortality rates for most common cancers for african-americans compared to um whites in our catchment area and that generally speaking um not only are these differences these racial differences pretty striking but for many cases including lung and colon cancer um that we see that the experience in metropolitan detroit is worse than in the overall sort of u.s population so why do these racial disparities exist and i know you know this is a really complex question and that dr wynn and others today have already um you know really kind of tackled this issue and thinking about it and the way we need to think about it of course is first to address the fact that um race is a social construct so there are lots of different components that are correlated with and contribute to um racial categories so specifically with respect to racial disparities in cancer we can think about things across the spectrum of socioeconomic factors like access to quality health care environmental factors um ranging anywhere from pollution to sort of neighborhood resources and quality societal factors like structural racism and medical distrust um cultural and psychological factors and then of course i think what gets a lot of attention is this idea of biology underlying racial disparities in cancer and particularly i think the thought that kind of goes along with that is genetics and ancestry even though excuse me genetics and ancestry is often um you know a very imperfectly core imperfectly correlated with the definition of race as sort of a social a social construct again so again i think that traditionally a lot of people have sort of thought about this complex problem as each of these factors individually contributing to racial disparities in cancer um but particularly in our group and increasingly sort of in the community in the literature we're really appreciating the degree to which each of these factors um contribute to sort of underlying biology of racial disparities in terms of somatic changes as well and really understanding that interplay between these um other sort of social factors and how that might be changing or changing underlying sort of biology of tissue or other um sort of biological processes might be um influencing racial disparities in cancer and i think a really great example of this comes out of um actually dr john carruthers group from here or there at university of michigan and looking at the emass phenomenon in colorectal cancer so this is the elevated micro satellite alterations that selected tetranucleotide repeats phenotype and colorectal cancer which is conceptually a little bit similar to the idea of micro satellite instability where you have differences in the lengths of these tetranucleotide repeats between normal and tumor tissue which is a result of defects in mismatch repair but emast is unique in that um you know we definitely are looking at different sites um but also this is very specifically due to somatic defects um or dysregulation of msh3 specifically um and it's been pretty well described now that this um this phenotype and that dysregulation of msh3 is really initiated by chronic inflammation so there are two interesting points that come out of that first that this is seen much more commonly in blacks or african-americans i think it's about twice as common um in african-americans with colorectal cancer compared to non-hispanic whites um and that this is associated with much poorer survival so we're definitely seeing sort of um evidence here of this inflammation inflammation initiated phenotype relating to differences in actual cancer phenotypes um within different racial groups associated with clinically relevant outcomes so our next question might be why is there an inflammation-initiated phenotype that's more common in african-americans with colorectal cancer and i think again increasingly you know our group is really interested in these hypotheses but this has gained a lot of traction in recent years in general in the scientific community that social determinants play a really big role in systemic inflammation over the life course that has implications for human health ranging from cardiovascular disease to covet 19 outcomes as well as cancer so how do we start to think about tackling some of these big problems and thinking about social determinants of how it interacts with biology um to answer or think about some of these questions around racial disparities in cancer um and on the plus side and you know sort of fortunately we live in an era where we have a ton of access to publicly available large data sets that capture a lot of these complex social and biological issues so one that i'm going to focus on today um for much of my talk is the utilization of u.s census data to capture a lot of area level metrics um and specifically i'm gonna be talking about excuse me the area deprivation index which is a composite measure of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage that actually uses 17 different census measures that um i think is kind of unique in that it goes beyond just addressing issues of socioeconomic status and also brings in some information about housing quality so things like running water and access to transportation and things along those lines so i think it does a better job of actually capturing some of those different um sort of social factors within uh at the neighborhood level so the um two maps on the right here the first um this one with the bright colors is showing the distribution of these adi scores or the the area deprivation index throughout the tri-county area that is captured by our cancer registry here at wayne state so um the dark blue areas are those with the lowest um socioeconomic disadvantage so those are tend to be the higher socioeconomic groups and then the dark red areas in contrast are those with the highest levels of disadvantage um and so the sort of lower end of the socioeconomic scale and i think two things really jump out from this graph first that you see um sort of intense clustering of these um neighborhoods and regions with high levels of social disadvantage in and around detroit and then also in the pontiac area and the other thing that's really striking to me is the degree to which you see sort of segregation of those areas right it's not just that there's a lot of mixing of red and blue throughout the map that we really see concentration in specific areas of those areas that have the the highest levels of deprivation so then um the map on the right is showing like how does this translate to to racial differences and we're gonna we're gonna dive into the details of this more but visually speaking um this map is showing um the self-reported race of residents within this tri-county area um where the green dots are those of black or african americans the blue dots are those of white individuals um and unfortunately you can see them just visually that if we were to superimpose those two graphs or those two maps that there would be a high high amount of correlation or overlap between the areas that have the the largest or the highest scores for social deprivation excuse me um and those where they are are the predominant areas where african-americans live in metropolitan detroit so you know we talked or i just talked a little bit about how maybe we can get at some of the social factors using data like data from the u.s census so how do we then start thinking about you know integrating that with uh the biological part of things and so those of us in the in the cancer world particularly thinking about somatic changes or of course thinking about uh tcga or the cancer genome atlas um which is an incredible resource with thousands of samples with tons of genomic profiling um but i think something that you know isn't talked about in the broader scientific community enough is the vast um and sort of dramatic race under representation of racial and ethnic minorities in tcga so about 80 of all the samples that reported um as of this i guess was as of 2016 but i don't think a ton has changed since then um were white with only 12 percent um being uh black or african-american and very small numbers of other racial and ethnic ethnic minorities so i think this graph is really striking or this figure is really striking because it tells us not only obviously that we have underrepresentation of these groups but how does that translate into sort of the science that we do with these data and so this graph is showing um the number of samples that we would need to detect even a 10 mutational frequency rate which is a pretty high mutational frequency rate um in terms of surplus or deficit of samples across different cancer sites and across different racial and ethnic groups so for um white individuals you can see pretty consistently across all cancer types we have a surplus of samples and of course you know um a surplus of samples for that 10 mutational frequency rate that also translates down into um having better power to detect things like rare mutations in these samples as well but then on the flip side as soon as you start looking at non-white or samples from non-white individuals you start seeing that we have these really strong deficits across cancer types and across each of these different um racial and ethnic groups and of most interest to our group of course is looking at that deficit related to african americans with a couple of exceptions um like for breast uterine and prostate cancer um we we just have a really dramatic under representation of black or african americans in the tcga which makes it really difficult to do some of those analyses where we can use some of these large publicly available data sets to answer questions around social determinants of health and uh biology so to start to get at some of these questions i'm going to talk a little bit about um a study that is underway now uh that's the disparities in cancer epidemiology study or the dance study um specifically thinking about colorectal cancer and this is a collaborative effort with um dr laura rozick and dr elena staffel at the university of michigan and of course my team at wayne state university and also um with machine shea who's the co-director of the louisiana tumor registry which is a seer registry based in louisiana at lsu in new orleans so um and i start out by adding another layer of complexity on top of the colorectal cancer and racial disparities issue by talking a little bit about um consensus molecular subtypes so these subtypes were derived in 2015 um to really sort of better capture based on transcriptome or sort of whole transcription level expression profiling sort of underlying prognosis related features of different tumors and the one that we're particularly interested in is the cms4 or the mesenchymal subtype um which is by far associated with the worst relapse free and overall survival so in this overall study of about 3100 tumors about 23 of those tumors were described to be in the cms4 subtype so as sort of a first pass analysis we were really interested in looking at what does this distribution look like in african-americans with colorectal cancer so we were able to use some data from the detroit research on cancer survivor study or the detroit rock study um which as marine described in the beginning um or before my talk is a cohort study of more than 5 000 african-american cancer survivors in metropolitan detroit and we did some pilot analyses using rna-seq data for 34 tumors out of the detroit rock study um and just classified them into these consensus molecular subtypes and saw a really immediate sort of striking difference in the distribution particularly with respect to cms4 um compared to what has been published and again um they didn't present in this published paper you know these results in terms of race ethnicity um but these studies are predominantly composed of uh white individuals so we're seeing a more than two-fold increase in the prevalence of cms4 in our african-american sample compared to um this largely white sample so this has really motivated us to continue to do this work at a larger scale and to help kind of address that deficit in terms of research and biology being done um in in african americans to really better address the question of are there racial differences uh in aggressive colorectal cancer phenotypes but not only to address whether they exist but to try to explore some of the mechanisms and really specifically focusing on the relationship between race social deprivation chronic inflammation and these aggressive colorectal cancer phenotypes so for the rest of my talk um i'm going to be focusing and diving a little bit deeper into this question surrounding race and social deprivation and how that impacts cancer incidents and outcomes in metropolitan detroit so in order to do this we use some data from the metropolitan detroit cancer surveillance system which is our population-based cancer registry uh again here at wayne state university that captures all cases within the tri-county area so we identified all incident cancers from 2012 to 2016 aged 18 and older for the four most common cancer types so female breast colorectal lung and prostate cancers and we were able to pair that again with census level data to get population count data so we could get an incidence um stratified by age race and sex and so integrated with this or together with this we were able to get demographic clinical first course treatment and follow-up data from the registry um and again going back to that adi measure that i was describing a couple of slides ago we were able to calculate and map adi to each of these our incident cancers and the population count data so that we could directly look at the relationship between adi race and cancer incidents and outcomes so um before we really dive into sort of the meat of our analysis this is just sort of a table and a graph that are quantifying what we were seeing um in in those maps a few slides ago where we see these really striking differences in the distribution of adi by race within metropolitan detroit so um you know just visually you can see that there's the distribution looks incredibly different we're highly right skewed for african americans who are much much more likely to reside in areas with these high area deprivation indexes um and to quantify this um african americans were more than threefold more likely to live in areas with sort of like middle levels of social deprivation and 36 fold more likely to live in areas of high social deprivation so really really striking differences in even just sort of the the general experiences of what what these neighborhoods look like in terms of of metropolitan detroit residents so uh how does this translate into cancer incidents so um we stratified our analyses specifically uh to look separately at non-hispanic whites and african-americans so that we could get a sense of whether sort of there were different patterns and how adi was associated with cancer incidents within these different racial groups so starting with breast cancer and this is stratified by the four main sort of breast cancer subtypes defined by uh hormone receptor expression and her2 um so for non-hispanic whites we actually see an inverse relationship between adi and cancer incidents meaning that people with who live in areas with more social deprivation actually have lower rates of breast cancer specifically for hormone receptor positive her2 negative breast cancer and we think that largely what is driving and what this is reflecting which is consistent with what's been seen in the literature is um access to healthcare and access to screening and participation in screening specifically that individuals who live in more social highly deprived areas are less likely to get screened and specifically less likely to have these more indolent cancers identified as a result of screening um we did not see any significant associations between adi and the other cancer types for non-hispanic whites and we're already getting into some of the differences when we when we're now looking at breast cancer subtypes in african-americans so um in fact we don't see any relationship between adi and hormone receptor positive and her2 negative breast cancer like we did for non-hispanic whites but in fact we see a strong inverse relationship uh with adi and triple negative breast cancer incidents again part of this is probably largely different by the fact that these cancers are more common in african-americans um but we also see sort of this interesting non-linear relationship with triple positive breast cancer as well so um this is going to be kind of a recurrent theme and i think thinking about and interpreting these data is obviously thinking about screening which is really important for breast and then we'll see that for prostate cancer as well but also thinking about sort of the differences in you know reflecting underlying risk factors um you know but that might be captured by differences in adi as well so things like um bmi or reproductive risk factors like the number of children um and breastfeeding and things along those lines so there's likely an interplay between sort of all of those things that are contributing to the differences in the patterns that we're seeing here so again for prostate cancer we see this strong inverse relationship or an inverse relationship among non-hispanic whites again likely reflecting increased screening among individuals with lower social deprivation but we don't see that relationship at all among african americans um where in fact if anything it's not statistically significant but there's actually higher rates of prostate cancer among people who live in the higher uh sort of social deprivation areas and again another sort of recurrent theme that certainly goes through my head as i think about these data is the idea that um you know we quantify area deprivation or social deprivation um and numerically they might be the same between different groups but what that actually is reflecting in terms of sort of the the characteristics of a neighborhood or the quality of you know a person's lived experience in that area is likely to be very different for um non-hispanic whites compared to african americans who live in regions who are numerically similar in terms of adi but might be very different geographically and in terms of other features as well so for colorectal cancer um we only saw an association between adi and colorectal cancer incidents for um african americans where there was this sort of increasing uh trend where higher social deprivation was associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer incidents um and we certainly did not see a linear or significant relationship for non-hispanic whites too far um but we did see it um being become significant for lung cancer even though we have this again sort of u-shaped distribution um not not linear but what's even most striking is this incredibly strong association between adi and lung cancer incidents among african americans and i didn't show it here because a lot of data and only so much time but if we were to specifically look at young onset cancer so individuals diagnosed under the age of 50 the difference in sort of these associations and the trajectories that we're seeing here are even more striking among young onset cancers so um it's really interesting things going on here and this is a somewhat limited analysis because we're using registry data so we can't pull in things like individual level data related to smoking for example which probably would jump into anyone's mind when thinking about um social factors and lung cancer incidents but um certainly is is a really interesting finding that we're we would like to do some future work to try to tease apart and understand what's going on there so in addition to these differences in sort of the patterns of association between adi and cancer incidents we wanted to see to what degree do we think or do we have evidence for adi actually mediating that relationship between race and cancer incidents so um this is looking again at each of the different cancer types for non-hispanic whites and african-americans on the left-hand side for each of these cancer types this is um showing the estimate of the association between race and cancer incidents so reflecting what we would expect and basically already know um african-americans are less likely to be diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive her2-negative breast cancers much more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancers and also more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal lung and prostate cancers so the um sort of the the plot on the the right side for each of these cancer types is showing what happens to that estimate so the relationship between race and cancer incidents when we include adi in the model and really what we were interested in is did it moderate the the effect of race essentially so um we did see evidence that there was significant sort of moderation of the effect of race on cancer incidents for homo receptor positive her2 negative breast cancer and for colorectal cancer and a relatively modest uh decrease so about eight and a half percent of the effect was moderated for the breast cancer subtype and then about seven percent was moderated for colorectal cancer so the next step we also looked at um adi as an effect modifier obviously you know thinking about that graph we saw a couple slides ago looking at the difference in how adi was related to cancer incidence particularly for lung cancer it's not surprising to see in fact that there is a strong effect modification uh effect for both lung and prostate cancer so lung cancer was interesting in that the effect of race on lung cancer incidents got stronger the higher the social deprivation index went right so something more like a linear relationship but prostate cancer was even more interesting where um in fact when you kind of subdivide down and look at the effects within the lower uh quartiles of adi excuse me that african americans were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in these lower groups but then that flipped and now we see higher incidence of prostate cancer among african americans compared to non-hispanic whites for those in the highest quartile of adi um so again um thinking about you know patterns of screening and other risk factors but also really i think um is indicative of the potential for this reflecting racial differences in individuals experiences of what area level socioeconomic deprivation is and how that affects their lives so last but not least we're going to take a quick look at how adi is related to cancer survival by race um so again this is just looking at breast colon and lung and prostate cancer um and we looked at this both by race overall and then uh by race for non-hispanic whites and african-americans and then we also looked at overall survival and cancer-specific survival so in general what we're seeing from here is that um adi tends to be positively associated with increased mortality so higher deprivation is associated with worse mortality um sort of across the board certainly for overall mortality generally speaking that is true for cancer-specific mortality um though it's a little bit attenuated for colorectal cancer and uh to some degree for prostate cancer um but then also we don't see any huge striking differences in the relationship between adii and survival by race um but then we wanted to again address that question of does adi mediate the relationship between race and survival so again on the left-hand side this is just sort of the unadjusted or only adjusted for age stage treatment and insurance status um the effect of race on survival where we see that african-americans are more likely to die um if they've after they've been diagnosed with breast cancer colon cancer or prostate cancer um actually inverse the inverse is true for lung cancer um but then what happens when we add adi to the model and we see much more substantial um mediation or moderation of this effect than we did with incidents so that when we account for area level deprivation um we're explaining about 50 of the overall mortality differences by race for breast cancer and similarly for prostate cancer so uh where do we go from here so um we we certainly have a lot of individual components you know we have established racial differences in cancer um and racial differences even in tumor phenotypes specifically we talked about colorectal cancer um we know or have a lot of evidence that social factors affect biological processes like inflammation and also see that striking differences in social disadvantage by race um and and their impact on cancer incidence and mortality but coming back to sort of the slide from earlier in my in this talk um what we need to do next obviously is to really pull all of this together to do a better job of of really integrating these data which is what we will be doing with our dance study um to really do a better job of accounting for each of these different things their impacts on biology and how that might explain racial differences in clinically relevant colorectal cancer subjects uh so with that um just lots of people to acknowledge both uh collaborators here at michigan uh wayne state and lsu and of course all of my people on my study team um i am happy to answer any questions
