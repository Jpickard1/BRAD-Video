[Music] these are the keys you find them in the dark I can actually [Music] [Music] all right so we're gonna go ahead and get started so welcome I know there's some new faces here so this is the tools and technology seminar series it is a weekly seminar series every Thursday at this time there's a sign in sheet going around this is just for the pizza so please just named out just justifies our having pizza at this event that we had people here that can eat it um sorry so I'm just going to forum with introducing our speaker so our speaker today is ko Ming our young and he is a min Sophia robbers lab and hematology and oncology good afternoon everybody thank you all for coming this is we talk about ya diffic I don't vacation of visit Jesus images in epithelial cancers so before I begin I'll just like to make a disclosure that I've licensed the fluidic device that are disclosing in this presentation from the University and also with a warning warning I'm not a competition about it just by training I'm a cancer biologist by training so I hope this is not too heavy on the biology site for you guys but if you have any questions feel free to interrupt and and ask away so I'll just start off with a brief overview of how the thought is going to be like first I'll give you an introduction on why we want to study invasive gene signatures and how we could possibly do that I'll follow up by describing a little about the fluidic device that I have developed in my prepar during my time here and I'll talk a little bit more about how I've applied this device to identify the gene signatures and I'll quickly conclude or if I run you through a summary of our main points presented so from cancer from a pencil biology point of view the overall survival rate for patients with locally or confined tumors that means cancers they have not they have not invaded past the primary site it's extremely high across almost all cancers but when once this cancer once cancer has invaded pasty the organ site and development invasion this survival rate drops and the survival rate the survival rate further drops when the patient devel metastasis which is when the cancer has spread up to dis loggins so from against the biology point of view fighting cancer invasion the biology or cancer invasion is a map it's a way of us trying to capture the disease before it becomes unsolvable and by doing so hopefully we will be able to detect certain biomarkers that would be of use either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and when we talk about biomarkers you know in the area of personalized medicine biomarkers are key in ensuring that this view succeeds so with advancement in sequencing technology and I'm sure most of them most of people here in the audience are working on algorithms to solve to identify the soft through the saw through the sequencing data this is really key in accelerating accelerating the progression of personalized medicine however problems still lie from the aspect of the biology where we observe have significant heterogeneity of the we see in almost on any type of tissue this complicates sequencing and also January is possibly a disconnect between the biomarker identified as well as the biological logical function of that mario marker in clinical progression currently we have several available solutions such as single-cell sequencing and plus everyday you know you use you see papers reporting new algorithms to help sort through sequencing data to make sense of the data that to identify biomarkers however single-cell sequencing still have quite a few drawbacks local capture rate you know you got sequencing error rate intrinsic sequencing error rate that you've got to sort through and algorithms affect the effectiveness of algorithms again is really dependent on what you put in and i believe this is probably seeing among you completed computer scientists the garbage in garbage out so what you get is really dependent on what you put in and so to solve this problem you always have to try avoid putting in garbage or at least separate the combustibles from the non-combustible so what does this mean towards like tumor head in the sense of cancer biology so there is definitely need for better quality input to provide provide for analysis and this can be done by trying to tease apart the heterogeneity at the upstream stage so we tried to tease apart the tissue heterogeneity and provide you with provide you know provide samples that we know more a little bit about and what do we know about tumor heterogeneity and you know how can we go about this problem so in regards to tumor heterogeneity the tumor invasion front is one of the better study fuse within this area of where the accumulation front demonstrate clearfield tipic differences from the rest of the tumor and also you know the tumor invasion front is also the key feature of cancer invasion and so you can if you if you remember i recall i say that you know when cancer invades the survival rate drops so the to me a vision fran has a positive correlation with survival outcome so how do we do this how do we study this well to begin with the cancer imaging process is the is a very complex biological process that involves lot of interplay of multiple factors this be broadly classified into extrinsic or intrinsic factors extrinsic factors can fall under mechanical biochemical or cellular and so nowadays if you hear a lot about immune therapy you know that's part of the cellular component of extrinsic factors and on the other hand you have an intrinsic factors coming from genetic instability such as microsatellite instability an additional burden and as well as epigenetic causes such as DNA methylation histone acetylation and you can imagine that this is too broad broad classes of factors actually in the playing with one another to play a role in this complex biological process so studying this complex biological process using the relevant models is really crucial in ensuring that we are able to make any progress so while the current current currently widely available sis model systems for us we have in essentially we have in vivo or in vitro and in vivo site we have we can look at it in the patient but that of course brings up several issues because we are trying to cure patients we're not trying to kill them by letting in Beijing occur and so the majority of in vivo work is actually done using non-human animal models the problems with non-human animal models of course ease of use costs in the fact that you need specialized personnel a personnel trade in animal handling to study this so it's not surprising that there's a lot of attention paid on to in vitro devices in v2 devices can be broadly classified into 2d and 3d and of course I'm pretty sure everyone most of you know that the 2d cultures devices are quickly losing favor among you know cancer biologists as they are not really fit they really live right the extreme end of the you know the nobody physiologically relevant and a lot of attention is repaid on to 3d culture devices micro fluidics organic culture in fact this is where we focus my attention on developing a 3d culture of I guess of cancer biology progression and more importantly the device that we construct must be compatible with patient material at different cancer types so with this in mind I'll just quickly jump into the description on the device that developed so this is a this is work that we published recently in 2017 Santa Fe reports it is essentially a purity device that supports the growth of cancer cells as a tumor mass in a 3d environment politically is this chamber made of PDMS so PDMS is a compound used in micro fabrication of fluidic devices it's optically clear that allows you to allows us to obtain a few images relatively easy easily so it is a it is a sealed chamber made of PDMS with free channels running through the center of the chamber in each of the channel openings we put adapters as you can see the alignment of the adapters are not flush the adapters in the middle channel are actually closer to the innermost of the chamber than the rest there is a reason for that we shall explain a little bit later on essentially what we do is inject the chamber with collagen or before the collagen permanent polymerizes we put an object there to moldy fluidic channels and as the collagen polymerizes withdraw the needle and we leave behind the channel and in the middle channel we inject as the cells which can be captured as a which will be kind of grown as a tumor mass so down here will be a tumor right containing in cancer cancer cells probably about one to two million cells in here forming an tight compact mass you can see here the scale is on the order of millimeters and you know so we are looking at it really from cancer mask point of view and the side view you can see this is just a side view of the device we have a cross-sectional view where we have the silk PF PDMS chamber with collagen contain with it with three fluidic channels or the in the middle of the collagen gel and in the middle channel we put the cancer cells known as humor mass the skills it's not the skill for reference and in either of the two fluidic channels we can introduce these growth nutrients by flow through a peristaltic pump or some other equivalent model so the the fact that we are introducing interest we are introducing nutrients via flow which suggest that we are going to generate interstitial pressure within the system so to understand how this system is distributed to vessels we just did a very preliminary COMSOL modeling this is just a simulation under the under the setting such that we have flow in one channel where channel the middle channel where their cells has no flow and in the third channel there's also no flow and based on the car comes to modeling we see that there's a there's definitely an uneven distribution organization pressure with interstitial pressure highest at opening of channel a where flow is being introduced but overall you can see that the system overall system the overall pressure in the collagen in the region between channels a and B is actually lower than that in between B and C where there's no flow so with this so that's what there was this was also a reason why we decided to we decided that we decided align the openings of this adapter further away from that off the channel because we didn't want the higher pressure to really disturb the inta to show that the fruity integrity the channel integrity so with that in mind we with this under this this set up we grew prostate cancer cells in this device and we were able to track the dynamics of invasion into the collagen over time and this is we are talking it's not like 1/2 days we're talking about 3 3 weeks 2 weeks or so as you can see here on the left hand these are to face images time-lapse face images of prostate cancer cells grown in the device you can see this black mass here is just part of the tumor right at date 0 and as the time progresses you sees certain bright objects coming up into the collagen gel and decide to leave the invading cells so because because of the ability to capture these images using by few we can easily quantify the invasion rate on invasion distance over time and this is done for both PC G and D 1 4 5 so what what you can appreciate is that the invasion distance of cancer cells into the collagen varies from region to region cancer cells invade lasts with the region of between a and B where there's flow in channel a then there then they are and there then the caste cells in between regions B and C when there's no flow in channel C so this is kind of counterintuitive because we were introducing nutrients through channel a and you will expect the cancer cells to invade more to us the source of nutrients and away from that so again that brought us back to the fact that there was an uneven distribution on interstitial pressure and that could have likely played a more of a role in directing invasion distance than nutrient sauce this was seen not just in PC three by bu one four five cells as well and moreover we also found when looking at overall invasion distance we found something interesting that the invasion distance or innovation invasion rate of different cancer cells did not remain static over time so as you can see here within the first two weeks of culture the one four five were twofold less invasive than PC three but almost like after two weeks you can see that this dramatic increase this almost like a spurt of invasion that onobu the cancer cells do you want four five cancer cells to catch up with them of PC tree this suggests to us that there might be some phenotypic plasticity occurring in the cancer cells that would be there's the complainer role in innovation rate so I like to also highlight that the invasion is it is known that the u15 are less invested in PC tree using conventional transferral invasion assays but you know and so our early findings our findings in the earlier time points support that but the fact that we see this change almost abolished after two weeks was something kind of interesting to us the two different ions two different but they are two different biologically they're very different one the PC tree is actually isolated from a bone metastasis where whereas the D one four five was actually isolated from the dura mater which is somewhere in the brain so there they did they came from very different origins so you know it highlights it points to you highlights the the heterogeneity between cell lines between biological samples when so when you're dealing with such things you know you're dealing subsidies you have to bear in mind that heterogeneity does exist and it is not static they change over time when the cell is growing there and exchange enjoy being like they inject no so channel be assumed so the cancer cells are captured within the channel they are not allowed to migrate out of the channel so we block their to be injected as cells into the channel and we've sealed them in so the only way they could go out is horizontal or due to the name other words to you say in certain enemies only for injecting yes yeah I'm sorry I didn't I didn't probably I didn't do good job explaining advice yes you're absolutely right but originally you so be was he said liquid about instead jealous so is liquid so so so when we model the channels this are this tree this tree fluidic channels are initially empty so because you do a needle we put a needle or some sort of cylinder in there to kind of clear the area of collagen so when the collagen polymerizes that region is free when you pull out the needle so it leaves behind a kind of like a fluid filled space that we can replace to cells and silly old feud yes and a is right promises something like that yes then be is like the tomb or witnessed a tomb yes this is kind of of course we don't have anything the cells here but we I have had successes in the putting entity the cells in one of the channels which I'll talk a little bit about later on so okay yeah so so phenotypic plasticity dynamic changes in cancer phenotype and this is not only seen we cannot only just use this to study cross the cancer cells we can use this to study breast cancer cell lines as well this is work time in my current lab where we've grown triple negative breast cancer cell lines someone for 9 PT 5 for 9 and MVA two three one and you can see here that we are also able to quantify the invading cells here highlighted as this bright spots on bright fuel because this is a low oh no objective amman magnification image so you don't see a lot of the cellular features but this is just to give you a sense of how the tumor right behaves and just for looking at a macro scale level you can see that in addition to just invasion rate you can there's also differences in the ability of the cancer cells to form tumor masses we believe that there might be some underlying biological implications behind that there is something of active study I can't comment too much more on that it's just that some this is a phenomenon that we observed more so than breast cancer cell lines we also able to apply grow cancer patient derived material in this device so I successfully use this device to culture tree PD access patient-derived xenograft this this is essentially patient material that have been transplanted into mice and we actually did those tumors from the mice and grew them in this device and we have also successfully grown proof material from pleural effusion which is the liquid isolated from the space between the around the lung and this are this this material is often found in patients with metastatic cancer so we've successfully grown them for up to at least three weeks for most of the D but for most of the material and we are also able to qualify the invasion rate of those days so just to give you a better sense of how the dynamics look like because right now if I only shown you still images this is just a time-lapse video of the tumor dynamics so this is one of the PD axis so you can see as time progresses on you see spike spots coming up from the tumor right mass Center and from here you can easily appreciate that invasion is not uniform throughout the entire term right for this patient you see only specific regions of the tumor they actually have invasion this against is this is also something of significance because in clinical patient samples you know can see invasion does not occur true yes what's the orientation this is left up or is left up left well is really family generally is here on the left but you said yeah saying that invasion was showing yeah so that's telling me in prostate cancer cells so we don't see that in tumor right here so I'm not sure what to make of it maybe there's again some heterogeneity in biology we're not sure so this is just some preliminary data that we got and it's just we are still actively studying this area yeah but good point no definitely definitely a good point is this seems to we only see that in prostate cancer cells but in breast it's yeah yeah so and PDX number two so you can see also you know invasion occurring over time in this PDX envision acute appears to be a lot more even throughout the entire tumor right so suggest like there's a lot of heterogeneity between biological samples and we are only a really really at the tip of the iceberg and the rific us to really understanding the underlying underpinning biological reasons behind that again the profusion behaves somewhat similar to PDF number two in the sense that we see even distribution of the invasion throughout the entire tumor rather than specific regions yes have you seen any concentration of invading cells near channel abnormalities like I'm thinking like yeah pulmonary embolism or something like that you actually see the small balloon so I think we really so yeah that's definitely some stroke like structural or what side effects but so it's not move but like is that what you're trying to get it yeah so I mean there is may be some correlation but we haven't really done indefinite assistance area so you know so that is taken over a period of 21 days so to give you a better sense of maybe a smaller micro scale time of how engaging cells occurred there doing so we use an MPA 21 which is highly invasive cell line to take a time-lapse video of invasion over 24 hours and this is kind of using the track mate function in image a we were able to kind of deep the dvd-r not even in it but elucidate how cancer cells and they appear to be invading in a linear fashion I also like to draw attention your attention to somewhere down here the cells down here because in the this invasion does not seem to be a mono directional it doesn't seem to be one direction it seems to be may appear to be bi-directional essence you see that invading cells actually going back into the going back into the human right so like say almost looks Brownian I once a is Brownian because like say look at this steady flowing the tracks back in so they did digesting some of the matrix in there we believe that that's the case they might have an easier path likely that's that's the that's the underlying theory behind likely the cells and that's why people are so interested in studying invasion front because they believe that the cells at the invasion front are the ones leading the way for the rest of the tumor to to to invade so I think you're being able to study the dynamics of such process and a real-time is I think of value expressing matrix so later on we will talk about yeah we will talk a little bit because we're twisting over what's the end of talk this is just to kind of highlight you the device wise capable of doing and what we did yeah and they don't talk a little bit about the gene expression analysis yeah so I think it's yes something with something that we saw I think I'm not sure I think it could be yeah yeah exactly so this is kind of interesting to there's something that popped up why is it going at an oblique angle it seems to be at least linear open channel C open is there flow I don't say bow so we arranged this such that channel a and channel C are mirror images of each other but there's just no flow going through channel C so it's a closed loop circuit okay yeah so it's a closed circuit so you can consider it closed yep there be things when you did you put the cylinder in there and then cast yes so could there be flaws when you're pulling it absolutely absolutely absolutely because it's an is this this is kind of like I've not achieved like GMP status of construction so this is you handmade and a lot of that definitely flaws in the construction I actually agree I thought this place could get biases and things yeah somebody do it by hand or pulling it out yes I don't really just gently pull all right okay so additional applications of the device we can use these study effects of hypoxia and evasion and down here we drew a bit gruesome breast it's triple negative breast cancer cell line someone four nine under the effects of no mastic or hypo singing the conditions and we find that under conditions of hypoxia cancer cells seem to emit less than under no moksha we are also able to do whole culture English culture experiments we are instead of so this is a so previously I've talked about a tree channel setting this is actually a five channel setting where we have fruit of fluids flow on to additional channels on the other side and we have macrophages either stimulated with phorbol ester or MOT so in this experiment we see that in the breast cancer cells tend to migrate more towards the the macrophages stimulated with phorbol ester than that without so suggesting that macrophage activity macrophages might have an effect might be secreting some factors that induce invasion and we are so able to call culture endothelial cells so previously I talked a little bit about including epithelial cells in the separate channels so down here I don't think you can see very well but you know we are able to grow some into the cells in channel a with the presence of flow so this will be a lining of endothelial cells around the cylinder and I'm sorry that you can't see very well but the alignment of the endothelial cells are in our parallel with the flow of our in parallel with with parallel with the flow I'm sorry yeah parallel with the flow I think I says GFP we're able to see far right the other range yeah oh so you can see the orientation of cancer cells in the direction of flow and you know because the GFP we can look for any structural deficiencies in entity themselves I will say it's perfect because you see a like an empty spot here but otherwise you know you generally get a pretty nice mono layer so in summary I just wanted to describe to you a little bit of a device they've developed and some of the potential applications that we have we are able to do with this it is compatible with different cancer cell lines and patient material and we are able to achieve Mountain culture over weeks without disturbing the culture and the cells remain viable and we are able to record the dynamics of cellular invasion down to a single cell level we also able to use this to study how different environmental factors can affect invasion and there's a possibility for Co culture with different cell types and we've so many multiple possibilities of air study you know then we decided I decided to really focus on elucidating the gene expression landscape of the invasion front because that's where we really want that's where really the bread and butter the meat of it is so this comes to me brings me back to the next next part of my talk which is using the device to identify invasive gene signatures in epithelial cancers so more so than emission rate invasion distance we are interested in what genes the invading cells Express which is basically the molecular phenotype of the invading cells to start off I focused on a molecule known as G d/f 15 so this G da 15 is a pet molecule of mine because I worked on it as a graduate student this is this molecule this is known as micro fish inhibitor cytokine is this member of the tgf-beta super family and it is known marker of metastatic cancers in metastatic cancer in both for both prostate and colorectal so I actually came from prostate lab so so in this study don't use just a receiver receiver operator curve when you where you see a positive correlation between serum macrophage cytokine one or gdf 15 with the presence of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients so there's a positive correlation between serum levels and vomit and on the right panel here you see some cool accumulated survivor curve of colorectal patients with different levels of GTA 15 essentially patients with high levels of GDI 15 have an overall lower survival rate than patients with lower level of Gd 15 so GTA 15 is an important marker both of metastasis and clinical outcome so in my own work as a graduate student I found that in addition to GDI 15 being a marker of metastasis we observe differential differential staining of GDI 15 in cross sequences xenografts so down here in the top row you see these are what we call immunohistochemical slides where we cut the prostate cancer jido grafted the tissue into 4 micron slices and we stain them from different scenes such as hematoxylin you'll see in stains the same four nuclei cellular protein the same four specific proteins such as G da 15 of EGF and negative IgG as a control so even at the low power setting you can you can easily appreciate that this also Brown is positive for sinning and blue is no stain so even a no power low power magnification you can easily appreciate that the staining pattern of G da 15 is differentially localized within the within the xenograph itself and it appeared to be near regions on the closest where there the source of blood and if you look at higher power magnification of the xenograft you can see that heaviest gdf feeling staining gdf seeming occurs in cells that appear to be pala sitting towards the regions of the cross-system blood so there may be so based on that there might be some correlation between about active ongoing biological process such as invasion maybe and gdf 15 expression this is not seen just in one view of view we see that in multiple views of view of the same of the same xenograft furthermore I've also elucidated that the expression of G di 15 can be modulated by mechanical signals mechanical signals so this is well done in the full app over the mechanical engineering where we use a pool known as the microprocessor ray which is like his name suggests a post an array of posts by regulating the height of the post we are able to modulate the stiffness of the attachment sorry what we find that is that on Polly substrate softer substrates jeanie15 that was increased and on more rigid substrate GTA 15 levels decrease so this work suggests that GDR 15 responds mechanical signals such as stiffness and this led us and I might just want to bring up to you again in case I envision being an interplay of different factors such as mechanical extrinsic and interesting factors so this based on this this kind of hypothesized that the ongoing invasion process where cancer cells invent into the ECM they might cause a change in these local rigidity of the surrounding environment that might feedback as a feedback to the cell as a mechanical signal to induce a change in cellular phenotype this can also occur in CDC's many undergo shear stress and you know and also in the distant metastasis when they colonized this society they may experience a different mechanical signal that caused them to undergo a phenotypic change of course this is only purely came up mechanical signals we have not considered the fact of the role of both biochemical or cellular factors as well but this is just kind of like a hypothesis based on what we know vascular yes so with that in mind that will sell so suggest that GD 50 will be more highly expressed in the invasion cell in the invasion front of prostate cancer cancer tumors so in fact we do see them okay so so we what we did was we stained it took the prostate cancer human rights that we grew we perform IHC on them we suction them at four microns and we stand for G da 15 as well as K SEC 7 which is a market or cell proliferation and this is the left it's just a low power magnification of the xenograph of the disease of the tumor right on the right here is a higher power magnification of the tumor right so on the right here it's just a hitch in Easton showing just a regular structure of the of the tumor right and you can see here there are certain several cell invading into the collagen and if you have to skip KSM first but let's just focus a little bit on GDR 15 so you can see that in GDR 15 their savior staining in the cells that invading to us the into the collagen and this if you this is very visualized by using and doing a 3d surface plot after staining intensity so this kind of supports but we see what we hypothesize proposed previously and you know cases what other markers do you think you could stand for or analyze for and those aggressive shells so right now I'm just looking at GD for right now but for just for this right now I'm we're looking at Gd 15 but we are adopting more omics approach so we are looking at gene expression analysis of these invading cells I've successfully isolated am NOT intoxicated by breast cancer if we shall talk a little bit about later part of your thinking that these shows undergoing energy transfer me well yeah I mean you could talk about you can think of it as some EMT related I think there's a lot of research that shows that EMT is not be all of metastasis and you know is more than just that but okay so so seeing GDI 15 over expression at the invasion farm was pretty nice and you know satisfied to see that and it's kind of supposed to see read our our model proposed and in addition you know you see also see ki-67 so this basically this tells you we did ki-67 to make sure that the cells were I should proliferating in the inner in the tumor and you know seeing that is writing a better hurry because I'm running out of time so yeah okay this is smooth on so in summary through the use of a mechanical sensitive button biomarker the SGD 15 we're able to demonstrate a positive correlation between jeanie15 expression and invasion together with ki-67 marker information so what we really want to do is actually the invasion front for more more omics approach to us to identifying novel markers of maybe invasion so this was this the following work that I'm going to present will be done on triple negative breast cancer cell lines which is why I mean the breast cancers like right now so so what I've done is basically isolated invidious a population from the if not even in sub population and long story short they are phenotypically distinct so this is how the tumor looks like we have the non invading cells are classified as the cells they're localized within the tumor right they're not invading into the collagen and the invading cells are classified as those bright spots here this is low magnification so you don't see the Sun of the substructures but these are all invading cells into the collagen I've managed successfully managed to isolate these two sub populations as match controls so you know when we subject them to gene expression analysis using microarray the fu matrix 2.1 ac21 array and you know based on the PC analysis you know we see there's a clear distinction between the non reading and invading cells so yes I'm sorry because you we face that so so this is the breast cancer cell line so this is what we presume to be pure almost 100% yes this is for my device yeah this is for my device so I'm sorry I grew up so I grew breast cancer cell lines in the device you know we met we let them grow for three weeks after three weeks we took out the device we isolated the invading cells from the no invading cells we isolate RNA from those invading cells and non invading cells and we send them for my career a and and based off on the B cells of the microwave we did a PC analysis plot and we see basically that the invading and non invading are phonetically distinct so you might see also separation between different batches but this is because I have to say that this was done at one time point both the cell separation and the micro rerun and this was done in another batch probably another batch of different chips so that could explain why you know you see such a difference between money baby cells are you beating cells as well the reason they're not invading Joan completely black as we couldn't recover over that fool of cancer cells just chock-full of cancer cells yeah so I guess maybe you wouldn't you weren't here earlier so what we did was yeah boy did was that we injected cells a mass of cells any one is yes so the because we are able to achieve 21 days of culture we allow enough time for the cells to read resolve themselves especially from invading and non beating okay there be edge effect when so adhere to the border of this absolutely absolutely but you know I think because we are looking at again we're because we're not isolating single cell so we are still looking at a population level so the contamination from the contamination from the edge effect will be minimal as compared to the non that effect so definitely that's a I mean because again yeah this is this is just the biology of how it's done and I think this is I think in terms of sample preparation this is a problem that everybody will face and you know but I think we forgot in this experiment at least the level of contamination is minimal of course you know there may be some experimental errors but oh yeah we can do FFPE but what I really wanted to do was light cell isolation so FFP is good but you know again you get problems with irony integrity and you know fixing is a problem is a lot of things you didn't consider with FFPE samples but we fly cell you don't have to worry too much about that and that's why we I mean anything obvious you know we are making a higher level of meeting a higher level higher level of QC is that if we are able to do in life we have no problem doing FFPE so I think we wanted to meet that bar high bar first you can't anything interesting out because it looks like the batch is separated on PC one and yeah so I had to separate them using yeah so I mean we're not sure so pip is helping me with soap units is the guy he was helping me with the genius pression expression analysis so we are trying to sort through this data right now and you know maybe make some sense out of it and definitely you know there's something on a list so what we're more interested in is well genes are being expressed in the invasion front so this is again Peter helped me a lot with this so we did a path I paprika analysis is maybe something that one more of more interest to you so basically we found 252 Huggins that were differentially not officially expressed but affected during invasion so this was this 250 genes were identified using a cut-off of 1.5 for changing expression with a p-value of less than 0.05 and using these twenty fifty two significant statistically significant genes we were able to kind of classify them using gene ontology based on biological processes and we're using a wig pruning method you know classifying ten genes per term and a p-value of less than 0.05 we were able to kind of classify this g20 52 genes not 12:52 genes we were able to come up with seven main processes though in they were involved in the process of invasion and not surprisingly you get you know extracellular matrix organization was one of them which is what you would probably asking about metric patellar matrix-matrix proteases you know we also have response to extracellular medium align which is which is very happening to me because mechanical signals is is a XSL matrix simulus so that's something that was good to see that popped up and you know we have some interesting things like dynamic process and anatomical process is so I mean how this is just kind of like this this is now complete and says lists of the genes that were upregulated after 2052 genes maybe only 40 or 30 or 40 are actually expressed here so again i'm again with peter and we're going trying we're going through this analysis you know hopefully we make some sense out of it not some sense more sense out of it so and in addition so right now we're just looking at a microwave but really want to do from biological perspective it's the validate that the target genes are really being upregulated at the envision front so looking at 2g w identified packs 1 ohm in 5a we stain the human rights so this are cancer cells again growing at the device for 21 days this time around we isolated them we section them and we stain them for his journey I did a back swamp protein in 5a up here c7 so as you can see here we do see up regulation as indicated by habeas staining at the invasion cells in the alleviation cells for both x1 and win 5 8 so this validates our what we see in a microarray so we know that the findings we obtained in the mRNA level are translated at the protein level so we also tried that on different patient material we see that interestingly we don't see the same signal pattern for all patient material we only see maybe one or two genes that demonstrate similar patterns I say for PD x1 we see different shifts in a higher staining of x1 only impeding x1 but P DX 2 & 3 we don't really see that so this was not obviously was this bad result but you know again the highlights again the biological heterogeneity that you experience between patients and between samples this is just H any staining of the x1 and with 5a so more so than just looking at the genes being upregulated we really want to do a network construction of the pathways involved in regulating these genes because we're looking at gene expression analysis this is only the output of invasion it's not a causal relationship and how get is the while these genes may be useful for a biomarker for diagnostic purposes they may not be useful of they may not be of therapeutic benefit so what we why so relevant is to identify the upstream signaling pathways that really kind of affect the expression of these genes so to do that I actually talked a little bit of Marcy and I worked a little bit on cytoscape Society skip has this application known as I regular application so I guess everybody's familiar there I won't go too much into it this is just the link this is the citation from sine earth so that detailing the process of how they do I recommend pathway so this is a preliminary analysis basically using the I regular application we were able to identify predicted prescription factors in this in this first directed map we have downregulated genes as green squares up regulated the genes as three triangles and predicted transcription factors as blue hexagons so you can see that you know interesting me you have this one big green square so this green square was a down regulated gene there's also identified as a potential transcription factor that regulates other genes so so yes this was a force directed that what we're using is record so this oh I can't remember the details I'm sorry so we use them so the sign escape they have I use the G mania force directed so yeah I use the default settings I've been playing around too much with the the coefficients and stuff like that but yeah so this is preliminary but um so I mean but if anybody has any more experience in elucidating puffy analysis like you know from huggy genes I'll be happy to hear any input because you know I think I need help with this because so right now we only have a list of particular transcription factors based off off the needs of genes that we have so what I really want is to identify the signaling path the signaling pathways that affect these transcription factors so if anybody knows of anything please let me know so in conclusion I'll just quickly run through we've created a development device that allows for robust long-term treaty culture and using the device we are able to identify potential applications biomarkers based off on like gdf 15 which is an Omaha metastasis which based on our results might be more useful early on in earlier stages of disease we also be able to adopt adopt omics approach to us identifying an invasion of gene expression profile of invasion invading cells right now if I need an irony but it's possible doing with DNA and protein proteomics so the good thing about this is that we have a known bug we have a non biological function invasion and with that by analyzing the genes we we can clearly associate these genes or any biomarkers identified with a non biology function and might help in helping us develop better stratification markers for personalized medicine although all of us of course the Nano reconstruction still needs work and based on how preliminary analysis it will appear that different individual patients will have a different quite a unique signature which we'll need to consider if we want to move on with this with that like thank you all of you and like and watch my past labs the full lap of a mechanical engineering perronnette Mariah and I started um and of course the DNA sequencing car questions yes yes I am actually looking to broaden I'm I'm looking to broaden the application of this device to multiple cancers so pancreatic it's fine I know here neck cancers is one because in vivo models I believe are difficult to obtain using internet so I think this is something that we could possibly talk a little bit about so pancreatic is of us another interest of mine liver so basically cancers are in dire need of biomarkers for better diagnostics I think that's where we want to really expand into I have to say we have to try if you I think to answer the question we'll have to try it there might be differences in the invasion rate between the ones that metastasize more than those that don't so I would say that invasion rate may be I mean based off on like MVA to t1 the results from MDA to t1 and as some opponents there is definitely a difference we are able to differentiate differentiate between how more invasive and less invasive cells or whether they translate to metastatic I think that's something we have to talk about and I can think of a couple of ways that we can do this but maybe we can talk a little bit more after this this okay with you what's the T crate for your patient arrives in your grafts so far is hundred percent yes four five yeah so a percent by 505 is not much I can say that yes it may go 200 maybe you get packet X I've done it what's that like a Texel yeah okay I've done that so yes that is the idea that is the idea of growing patient maturing these devices subjecting him to a specific therapy that the patients undergoing identifying resistant cells and phenotyping them for marcus of resistance that could be used for additional secondary as like mallanna yes yep and some 149 that was 149 patient tumor example that they tried to grow in the culture and was only the second successful yes and at the fact that we can I mean I think the fact that I can I was able to culture pleural effusion I think it's very heartening to me because you know being able to do that is you come in you have patients coming in with muscle fury fusion and they don't know what to do with that and you know maybe we can just use that but definitely I'll be happy to talk more about mcf Kenny's I've anything so instead I've tried so MC attend is doing bait they do anything but the thing is if MC attend is they are not really normal right yeah so I mean patterns form so the ones I've used are transformed actually the rest transform I think yes rest rest transform yeah but we can talk more about it yeah so I think the really we use a proper control will be happy we have to use primary primary cells like primary on transform human memory epithelial cells or like like Sehun transform swimmers yeah bronchial epithelial cells and those how primary cell lines do use this a real negative control hmm really yeah fish makes every news yes in different in visionary you receive great do you know themselves percentage Oh percentage I think is kind of hard to because the cells you'll be easy if we could quantify the center mass but because the mass the center mass is so tightly packed with cells that we are unable to to quantify how many how many cells there are in there but I would say maybe 10% you know um just eyeballing it you know 1000 could be I mean so I I can't say for sure I can't give you a number but I think you know well we could we could no actually maybe be able we should be able to do that so looking at the H&E so looking at hey shinee we can probably because this is the for my current slides so this is a slice of tissue for microns deep thick and this is across the tumor so we can probably quantify how many cells are here this is how many cells in there I'll say maybe you're on the orders of 100 or even 1000 probably yeah you're right [Music] yeah but the good point yeah it's something I should consider yes designed for solid tumors have you thought about adapting it you say glad for your answer so I have not tried it yet but I think in lymphomas might be something of yes yes is something definitely are you working on lymphomas no oh okay I see I see I see yeah
