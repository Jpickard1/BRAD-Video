I'm happy to be here I guess yeah it doesn't take too much time to to make the journey um so I guess today will be a little bit different than what you're used to or at least maybe you're expecting it to be a little bit different but a lot of the same sort of principles that maybe you've you've come accustomed to to hearing and thinking about I I hope to convince you is is actually pretty widespread across the kingdom of life um and so I'm going to start just to tell you a little bit about um sort of the outline of how I have this talk organized I'll give you a little bit of background on some things you you may need to know so we can all kind of be on the same page and then I'll tell you a little bit about just a little bit about some past research already published um from my postto and then I'll jump into sort of what what I'm trying to finish up now um also work that I I started from my postto I need to mention and then hopefully if we have time I'll be able to tell you a little bit about some of the stuff that that the lab has started doing um over the last eight months all right so I think like a lot of people um in this room and in your department are really concerned with trying to understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype so plants like other eukaryotes and multicellular organisms um have a lot of intraspecific variation right so here's some examples of a rabid opsis in this bottom in the middle of this slide here this is all the same species you have different morphologies we have different colors different architectures um of the plants different total shapes and so there's a lot of intraspecific phenotypic variation that exists within species also in in Plants right and also like humans when we use gwas to try to understand that Association we find that most of the trade Associated genetic variants are located in non-coding regions so up to about 95% depending on what species we're talking about of those trade Associated variants end up being in in non-coding regions of the genome and so if we want yeah so far so good right so far so good um you know if we want to understand you know how those variants are impacting phenotypes what is the link right we need to understand a little bit about potential mechanisms and and one of those ways I think lucky for me I've always been interested in CIS regulatory element and this is sort of a justification on on studying them further but um CIS regulatory elements let's just get you know if you don't think about those as often as me um I'll just want to give you a quick background and and so generally they're known as binding sites for sequence specific transcription factors that have some sort of General impact on transcription um and so there's there's a bunch of different flavors of CIS regulatory elements probably the best understood are promoter elements so those are the elements that are located at just Upstream of transcription start sites trying to point to it here so that would be a promoter sequence um those have been leveraged um a whole bunch in in plants to make reporter lines and promoter bashing to look at changes in in cell type expression patterns so a lot has been studied uh on those and they're easy to identify because of the location relative to to genes um somewhat less well understood or enhancers which can be you know hundreds of K bases away from the genes they regulate they can be upstream or Downstream or even within the genes themselves particularly within introns um and they they operate in sort of a location orientation and uh position independent manner of the genes they regulate and then sort of the last two are are silencers which um as their name implies elements that silence gene expression and we also have insulator elements um and these are elements that that basically DeMark and restrict the area in which different regulatory elements can act and so all of these different classifications of of Cy regulatory elements um also exist in Plants we have evidence for insulators and silencers Motors enhancers um and and they can have huge impacts on on phenotypes and probably my favorite example um is this one of of maze so maze is corn if you go to the grocery store and you buy corn this is um this is a species that that you that you take home so corn comes from a um a subspecies of maze known as tiente that originated in central Mexico and tiente is this plant on the left side here and the only there's a there's several differences but one of the major ones I I hope is readily obvious is that this one tiente makes tons and tons of branches right and modern maze is only a single stock with apical dominance and so one of the like the very fundamental changes that led to the the modern maze that we see now from tiente was this insertion of a transposon Upstream of a gene called tb1 and so this transposon confers enhancer activity to tb1 so in tiente the the insertion is is absent in this region and you get very low levels of expression of tb1 and almost no expression in the axillary Marist stems which are these these stem cells that exist in the axles of of these leaves and so when you have high levels of expression in the axillary Mar stems tb1 suppresses lateral Branch formation so this is just one example and I should also mention that this insertion Upstream of tb1 is fixed in all of modern Maze and if we delete this regulatory element this located on Hopscotch you can revert back to the ancestral phenotype right so this is one example of a of a single transpose on a single regulatory element variant that has a a pretty drastic effect on on the phenotype all right so how do we identify you know regulatory elements genomewide um there's a bunch of different ways you know over the years I've counted things like DNA sequencing m& sequencing Fair seek had its um you know time in the Limelight for a little bit uh but I would argue that probably the most um the most dominant form of of CIS Reg element profiling nowadays comes with with a tax seek and so a tax seek stands for assay for transpose A Accessible chromatin sequencing and all of those methods I should point out sort of Leverage The the biochemical feature of regulatory elements and that typically they require accessible chromatin for activity right so a transcription factor most transcription factors can only bind regulatory elements that are located within within accessible chromatin and so the way that uh a tax seek works is we have this hyperactive transposase which has sequencing adapters uh loaded to it forward and reverse sequencing adapters and so when we when we treat chromatin with this transposase we get preferential integration of those adapters within accessible chromatin right shown here and conveniently those adapters are known and so we can amplify fragments with forward and reverse primary to the to recognize those adapters and so when we get a we get a final final Library product that looks something like this right so then if we sequence that library and align those reads to the genome more specifically if we look at the ends of those fragments or the starts of the reads and do a pileup of of those of those genomic coordinates we find things that look like this which are we're going to call accessible chromatin regions right so these are regions of the genome that show high levels of accessibility and putative regulatory activity all right so when I started my postto you know a lot of there was you know this motivation to try to understand genotype and phenotype relationship um but sort of the sub aims of those was trying to understand more of what are like the mole how does molecular diversity result in cellular diversity um and so one of the things that we didn't know at the time was how regulatory elements were involved in the specification maintenance and and also differentiation of plant cell identities and then sort of generally we we also don't know um we have a very limited understanding of how regulatory element variants affect you know cellular and and molecular and also organismal traits outside of those few case examples that I've shown you and the issue was that we don't have plant stable plant cell lines right so unlike mammals we can't just culture you know differentiated plant cells indefinitely they will dedifferentiate they become toy potent and become just a mess of stem cells um which is a cool biological phenomenon but it's it it makes studying cell type specific processes and functions really impractical um and so that's a huge Challenge and so when there have been efforts to profile and understand um cell type specificity and cell type functions in Plants it's it's been really hard and uh the way that it's had to have been done it's only been done actually in a single tissue in one species in a rabid opsis Roots um and that was a huge effort where basically they had to use known marker genes right with known cell type expression patterns and clone them in front of a reporter and then sort cells right so you're taking the promoters of of some you know well-characterized marker Gene attaching it to something like gfp and then sorting cells and then doing molecular profiling on on those purified purified cells the other way was through just manual isolation like manually taking one cell at a time or using something like laser capture right yeah yeah yeah it's it it was rough um and so sort of the synthesis of those issues is you know all the regulatory element research that has been done in Plants prior you know prior to to this work was been limited to bulk or tissue scale s of profiling right and that's not ideal because plant tissues are homogeneous populations of cells sometimes up to 30 different types of cells in a very limited small space all right so that's that's not great all right so now I'm going to tell you about some of the ways we try to address those those challenges um and like I hope I hope most of you are aware of of single cell profiling this is becoming somewhat obsolete now but um I still feel like I I have to usually I give this talk to planned scientists and they still haven't heard of it um and so and so I have to include this slide maybe this is something everyone else is is really familiar with but in case you're not uh the way it works is we'll isolate nuclei right so we'll digest um release nuclei from from cells either by chopping the cells with the razor blade or grinding pesl and mortar um so then we'll isolate nuclei and then we'll tagmented AIS loaded with sequencing adapters and then the magic happens where we load the nuclei onto this Mar fluidic chip and we get a stream of of of beads and the stream of nuclei that move through the channel and then this there's a stream of oil that will partition droplets um and so the idea is that if we can get a single nucleus and a single barcoded bead into one droplet then we can we can profile the accessibility of that nucleus and so each of these beads contains a 16 Migo that's appended to all the accessible regions from from the nucleus that's in that droplet right so if you can just keep your focus on this one droplet here has one colored bead and one nucleus all the accessable regions that have already been tagmented in the genome will get a a short 16 based barcode attached to them so that we can tell later down the line after we do sequencing that this read came from some nucleus right we can put all the reads together that have the same barcode and so we know that all those reads come from the same same nucleus all right so we applied that method to to six different organs um at different developmental stages in in maze um at the time it was a lot of nuclei now people will probably laugh at that because we have you know some atlases coming out with tens of tens of millions of cells across various stages of development and and life the life cycle of organisms um but at the time this this was this was a pretty big effort um and so one of the first things that we notice first of all is that cell identity so each dot in these plots represents a single nucleus and sort of generally dots that are close together uh have more similar chromatin accessibility profiles across the Gen so two dots that are close together are more similar two dots that are very far apart generally not as similar right and so one of the first things you'll notice is that cells that come from the same tissue look more similar to each other right so there's a spatial sort of um spatial information that's that's captured by doing um by doing single cell profiling a lot of the cells that come from the same tissue share a lot of um share a lot of their their accessibility profiles although we do see some some inter mixing of cells from from different tissues all right so generally we find about 10 large what we're going to call clusters um but when we zoom in on those those major clusters we find additional sort of heterogenity um amongst amongst different cells and so it was really that level of of resolution that is is what's denoting the cell types um in our data sets so just to give you an example of that um I'm showing you on the left side two genes that are specific to bundle sheath it's a vascular cell type um makes up the veins in in the stem and in the leaves and and they're part of the the photosynthetic Machinery they partition um C4 photosynthesis we don't have to get into that but the the point is that these two genes here are specific to to this cell type and so if we look at uh the accessibility of these two genes within U across different cells we can see that we have colocalization of signal in the same population of cells right so the same cells are showing cell are showing specificity of of of Chromatin increased levels of accessibility for those two genes likewise we have two genes that are specific to misail cells and if we look which G which cells show high levels of accessibility for for those two genes we see again colocalization and overlap right so we we know that these two genes are specific Amil and we see the same cells show high levels of accessibility um and I'll just point out that we're using accessibility here as a as a proxy for gene expression yeah yeah I think it's yeah I think it's fine sorry so I was G to say you know I I'm not a plant person but um you know Mae has a lot of duplications in it right like a lot of plants so how does that when you're actually functionally mapping the atch reads back how do you distinguish between the different copies and so forth or do you just throw those out and this is all based off just the unique mappings or I I don't understand I I it feels like that would be a big challenge clearly you've overcome it I'm just curious how yeah that's a great question so the way I handle that so maze does have a whole genome duplication event um thankfully it was long enough long enough ago that one of the genomes has become has become like a sub genome and there's there's sub genome dominance in Maze and so one of those one of the two copies got destroyed basically but it is still an issue so the way we handle that is um we set High mapping quality thresholds and then also we remove reads that have multiple mapping or even potential other mapping if that if that makes sense um so it does um it's the XA flag I don't know how else to say it um from bwa but if it has an XA flag we get rid of it um heavy fil but you still have enough signal to yeah yeah yeah as long as we're using unique reads uh I think that's to me I feel pretty confident um but yeah so you know so we'll use chromatin accessibility sort of of proxy for for gene expression and I mean we can show it you know this way on on the um Maps right by by using a sort of uh heat as signal um but we can also look at it in a more conventional way which would be to to take all the cells from from an individual cluster and pile them up right and so in this way you can see that that only one of these clusters cluster 38 shows any sort of um specificity and accessibility Upstream of of these two genes which end up having having to be um specific to to to xylm and so we can using this sort of approach plus some automated U machine learning based um annotation approaches we got about 52 different types of cells um in this data set all right so it's it's it's great to be able to identify cell types that we have to use it for something something useful um and so one of the things that we wanted to know right away is first of all how good are our annotations and then number two can we make predictions on gene expression for for genes that we actually have no idea what what they do what Their expression profiles look like um and so we teamed up with Dr Andrea gvo Lab at Ruckers along with Zong and Chen who um was very kind to do some RNA and situ hybridization for us so we gave them a bunch of genes um just showing you one example here it's a the grf transcription factor that that we predicted would be highly expressed or would be specifically expressed within the inflorescence marem of of the ma Hassel which which is this part up here as well as in the the spikelet mar stems which are these cells down here and also zoomed up um on this side um and lo and behold you know our predictions matched exactly what we saw with the RNA and situ and so even the the magnitude um we we predict higher levels of expression um within the inflorescence Maris which is this part up here which we which we see happen all right so we started to feel a lot better um about our data set and actually its use for for for for being able to generate more markers in the future all right but because ex you know we're focused on regulatory activity we can't just look at accessibility right we also have to look at at gene expression and transcriptome profiling and so we also generated single nucleus RNA seek data um for Maze seedling so it's a very young stage of the seedling um and then did an integration with with liger I don't see Josh here I was going to make a joke about liger but he's not here yeah yeah bummer um but we used we used Josh's software to do an integration and it worked it worked really well we can capture all theum all the different cell types and and we get very good overlap and consistency between these two different modalities just to show you kind of how well um how well it works um is I'm showing you five different marker genes um as well as the the cells that are specific to to the attack modality and cells that are specific to the RNA profile and and we see very strong overlap between uh between signal for those two different two different profiling methods all right so how can we use these data to learn something new right I mean it's great to you know just just getting cell type specificity to all in plants is kind of a big deal because it's just something we don't have but can we learn something new about the biology using this um and so one of the things that I I notice is that when we compare sort of generally Gene access ability with uh expression across these different cell contexts we get a very good level of agreement it's about 60 0.6 correlation for for spearman's correlation but one of the things that you notice is that in some instances we see genes that are highly accessible but they lack expression altogether and that to me was kind of weird right it's like how do we explain this discordance between the correlations right we have good correlation but it's not it's not one right so obviously there's something else happening and so when we take these genes that are accessible yet silenced one of the things that we notice is that they're highly enriched for k27 trialation and so in plants and I'm I'm I think this is also the case in mamalian systems but k27 is a classic Mark of Developmental gene silencing um and what was was really interesting is that most people actually thought that k27 was Associated trimethylation is associated with like closed chromatin inaccessible you know I mean obviously you're not being transcribed but the the idea is that these are just knots of Chromatin all wound up um and that's actually just not the case um we see levels high levels of accessibility in promoters obviously not as high as as as Express genes but um notably higher levels of accessibility compared to genes that are marked by DNA methylation for example um and we also noticed we're wondering how how can this be and so we were looking at at the accessible regions that are specific to the to the silence geneses that are that still sort of maintain accessibility as well as have k27 trimethylation and we found these polycom response elements um within their promoters all right so these these are our TF binding sites for transcription factors that recruit the prc2 um repressive complex um and so this is actually one of the the first instances at least in the plant that shows that you have to have some level of accessibility in order to facilitate silencing and that actually is still somewhat maintains an accessible configuration um and that allows the PRC to complex to come in and silence those genes so it's not just a bound a ball of wound up chromatin there there's actually some fluidity and accessibility there all right so another way you know I we realized and this is unpublished um that we we could use these data was to try to do a sort of ENC silico chipseek um and and this is kind of a big deal in Plants because we don't have antibodies for transcription factors I think there's like 50 antibodies total for transcription factors in all plants um and so if you want to know where your transcription factor of Interest that's you know you've been studying for decades is binding well good luck right um but we realized that we could use these data to sort of make predictions about that um and so the way that works is we we'll start with a fully integrated and actually this would be greatly improved by using um by using multi or the multiomic profiling methods that exist now but um what we did was we took this integrated embedding and then did a reciprocal imputation so we imputed the RNA profiles onto the attack cells and then imputed the attack accessibility data onto the the transcriptome cells and so what that allows you to do is to do an association test between the level of expression of a given transcription factor and the accessibility at any given Locus in the genome right and so you could do this in in in a spec like in in very um specific cellular context you can split up your cell types and run the association you see the Association disappear in different cellular context maybe the genes never express at all in which case you'll not find an association right and so when you do that you can identify all the regions of the genome that have a strong positive association between the level of accessibility and the expression of of some transcription factor and when we take those regions we're actually able to find and and capture the motifs that you would have predicted so for example this the transcription factor that we Pro profiled here is is is a bzip 61 and The Motif that we recovered the novo looks just like another bzip 69 in rabid opsis that has been profiled using using dap seek um and so this is a way that we can very quickly profile and make predictions on on interactions of transcription factors with different regions of the genome without ever having to do an experiment and and you can of course you could do this for all transcription factors in a genome all right so the last thing I want to talk about as far as published data um to me was was actually one of the more exciting results and and so one of the things that we did was we're just curious you know in trying to establish the functionality of of these regulatory regions um one of the things you can do is look at the level of of selection or the level of DNA polymorphisms that exists in those in in those regions and so we compared um the level of of snip enrichment you know all all the variants that exist intraspecifically within the spe species within cell type specific acrs accessible chromatin regions and also like the nonell type specific accessible chromatin regions and actually what we find is is very high levels of conservation or depletion of of variation within cell type specific accessible regions but when there is genetic variance within within those those loai they tend to have big impacts on on phenotypes right so here I'm showing you the the level of enrichment of of gwas hits in in both of those scenarios right so despite being under lots of of strong purification purifying selection cell type specific accessible regions when you do have variance in them they tend to lead to phenotypes that can be captured all right so now I'm going to tell you and hopefully convince you a little bit convince you to join me in in studying plants um and this was actually very a strong motivator for me in realizing feasible this the project I'm about to tell you about really was um so we use maze for for trying to understand molecular variation and and here's why it's amazing uh number one it has very rapid LD decay in humans or Mouse you would need 10 to 40 times as many individuals to get the same resolution the same hype size be able to find map variants that are causal okay so we need a a massively reduced population size and that makes the experiments much more feasible at least from a cost perspective um there's also extensive just nucleotide diversity we have lots of variation within the species and you need variation in order to map map these traits right we have lots of phenotypic diversity these are all the same species right they can the the female infloresence look totally different and the genetic the the plant architecture um of the stock and and how many leaves and and what they look like is is very diverse and there's we actually were the first species to have multiple whole genome reference scale assemblies endtoend telr assemblies um and that was published back in 2021 so we had 27 genomes when the human genome still only had one so we have lots of resources available to us all right now that we're all going to be ma Genesis moving forward I'll tell you about the experiment um so what we did and this is with the help of Schwan Zang um in my postto lab postto advisor lab Bob schmidtz um and what we did was we had this population of 172 very dis maze genotypes geographically spread throughout the entire world um and we took nuclei from you know anywhere from four to 27 genotypes at once right so we'll take we'll take seedling tissue put it on a petri dish from all these different genotypes chop Them Up release nuclei do single cell attack seek and because all these genotypes have already been sequenced we can use the known genotypes snip data vcfs to go back and say okay does this cell look more like this genotype a or look more like genotype e so we use maximum likelihood to assign genotypes um just sort of ad hoc right and so this is the way we can very quickly generate lots of data without um without having to do nuclear isolation one genotype at a time um and the other benefit to this was that we realized we could massively overload the Chip And and generate lots of data um you know kind of skirting the the recommendations that are recommended by the manufacturer because we knew that we could we could remove the barcodes that represented um doublets uh in our data set we can talk more about that later but just to give you a sort of overview of what it looks like um one of the things that I was curious to understand is just what kind of variation exists within the species in terms of regulatory regions so we can identify these highly conserved accessible regions where the sequences themselves are are highly conserved I told you that we we have whole genome sequencing for all these inbred lines um we can find also regions where the sequences themselves are dispensable they're lost um and and not totally present across all the different uh all the different inbred lines in in this population so sort of alt together we had about 70 we found about 70% of accessible regions the sequences themselves are are conserved within the species um and that's also supported by conservation across across different different plant species within the grasses um and so we feel pretty confident the these are very highly conserved and other regions that that do show regulatory activity tend to be more variable um within within this population all right so just digging into those a a little bit more um we found that you know the conserved this is not really that unexpected but the conserved uh regulatory regions had a much lower overlap with transposable elements so it seems like the dispensable or the newly evolved regulatory regions tend to arise or at least are more associated with with just transposons generally and another sort of indication that you know things that are conserved are important is we can also map um star seek data back on onto these regions and we find that regions that tend to be more conserved have much higher levels of of enhancer activity and then sort of the nail of the coffin for me is that we can we can also train model uh to see what are important predictors of of conservation within an accessible region and we find that a lot of uh uh transcription Factor binding sites that are are very core developmental transcription Factor binding sites like lateral boundary domains um Sosa promoter binding proteins so transcription factors that are important for for development of the plant tend to be very highly conserved and contribute to conservation of of an accessible region whereas transcription factors that are more responsive to the environment such as drebs so these are drought response elements um worky transcription factors are known pathogen response um transcription factors and so those tend to be less conserved and these might be um just more more important for sort of IM immediate or local adaptation and maybe not necessarily conservation you know across the the the entire species all right so I think the obvious thing is that when you get lots of you know you you generate this molecular data and and from a whole bunch of different uh genotypes one of the things you can do is try to map those molecular traits so here I'm showing you a single Locus with a bunch of different genotypes and we can find Regions where we have um you know accessibility is highly Dynamic and and it turns out that we can actually map those those uh this as a phenotype using gwas like implementation so we can we can generate Manhattan plots and identify variance that are associated with with the variation in chromatin accessibility right so to me this this was really exciting because now we can start to get at what are the determinants of accessibility in in plant species which is which was unknown and one of the first things that we wanted to check is just do we see um do we capture known CIS regulatory varant that that exist in in the species and and indeed we do so here's a few examples CTC CCT 9 is a known um a known regulator of flowering time in Maze and there's a very well-characterized transposon insertion that conferred um adaptation to to longer day lengths so maze came from the tropical regions and then we brought it up into more temperate areas where we have much longer day length um and so that allowed maze to to better withand our climate um and so we see that specifically within temperate lines we see accessib accessibility and you would in infer also um greater regulatory activity in lines that are in temperate areas um we also find some others um also flowering time related related genes and and some others that are associated with with differences in architecture texure this is actually a fine Ma um CIS CIS variant within a promoter that affects the the angle of leaves um relative to the stock in maze um and so having very narrow leaves actually allows you to plant much denser and it's it's a huge agronomic interest um so we were able to find some of these variants that have been previously characterized um one of the cooler things um that I that I was actually pretty pretty amazed to see was that when we take these uh these chromating ility qtl we can compare them with known expression qtl and we get about 25ish per of of accessibility qtl are also associated with expression variation and it turns out that most of the alternate alals in the population are deleterious at least if you're a gene that wants to be expressed or a region of the genome that wants to be accessible so most alternate alals reduce gene expression and most of them also reduce similarly reduce accessibility it's about 75% of all chromatin qtl it also turns out that most of the huge the large effects um that we see are come from rare leals um and that's actually Al that's also consistent with with eqtl data that exists in May so and it seems like these these rare leals that are mostly biased well I'll tell you about the cell type profiling here in a second but the takeaway here from this slide is that the rare variants tend to have larger effects on on chromatin accessibility in G expression all right and because we did single cell sequencing we can also look at the the cell context variability that exist um in these data so ultimately we we came out with about 700,000 nuclei um this was about a year and a half worth of data collection and thinking I was done halfway through and then trying to do cell type specific chromatin mapping and realizing I had a lot more to go um but thankfully we we finally finished um data collection on on this and we can very nicely find all the different cell types based off of different marker genes just like I described to you before but now we have a much more comprehensive Atlas um at least in terms of of numbers of nuclei and and ability to detect regulatory regions within within maze um and just like the bulk scenario we can also identify chromin and qtl in specific cell types and and this um was actually quite interesting to us because it turns out that most of the chromatin qtl that we identify are very cell typ specific so for example here's a a c a qtl that we find in in bulk tissue and then when we look in in different cell context we only find this this qtl present within misail so it turns out that the cell context is an important determinant of how these uh variants that affect accessibility you're able to manifest all right so I told you that most chromatin qtl are are very limited in in the number of cell types that they're detected in and the rationale for that or at least our observation is that it turns out that the the patterns of of or at least the the significance of Chromatin qtl identification the power to detect it very closely mirrors the actual patterns of accessibility right so we we're able to Define chromatin qtl that's specific to a cell context and it also turns out that accessibility is very specific to that context as well so most of the time we're finding chromatin qtl um with type specificity because that accessible region is cell type specific whereas things that tend to be more broadly accessible um they tend to get sort of masked in in the profiling all right and because we had lots and lots and lots of pn5 Integrations one of the things that you can do is look for these things called transcription Factor footprint and so transcription Factor Footprints are these um basically regions where you have a transcription Factor that's bound and pn5 which that hyperactive transposase can't actually integrate its adapters where that that transcription factor is is is bound to right so it can only insert adapters flanking a a transcription factor and so we used uh find mapped chromatin qtl to to see if well do we do we find any variants that have very high effect within transcription Factor Footprints right so we first of all you have to we used um we used this transcription Factor footprinting method to identify regions or or small segments of of DNA within accessible regions that we predict would be bound by transcription factors and we find that more than 50% of of these TF Footprints or transcription Factor Footprints have fine mapped chromat and qtl within them right so these are these are statistically fine mapped using sort of the summary statistics um Downstream um in taking in account LD but more than 50% of them are located within TF prints right so we think that this is sort of the main causitive um the mechanism for how chromatin accessibility is is variable within within the population um one of the things that we have to check right is that if we of course we're doing transcription factor footprinting in different cell contexts that that the the footprints that you recover are reflective of that cell types biology and and indeed we find uh for example the the lateral organ boundaries transcription factor is enriched in the lateral organ primordial boundaries cells we find others like the doth transcription factors which are known in specification of floam cell types we see those in the floam as well as in the floam precursors um I'll save you sort of the plant biology of this slide and just tell you this is kind of what it looks like but the one of the things that we noticed um so here we're mapping uh this this top box is the the transcription Factor footprinting score which is output by the software that we used for this analysis is um and and sort of the way we did it to add power was to to aggregate genotypes that that share a hype um in a very small region in order to to really boost up the the number of observations that we get um and so one of the things that we noticed is that the transcription Factor footprints that tended to be cell type specific were on were on the edges of accessible regions and and sort of more generally when we when we took that that that anecdotal observation and and sort of mapped it out throughout the entire genome we find that the transcription Factor Footprints with with very high levels or that are cell type specific we only find those Footprints within one cell type that they're located primarily on the edges of accessible regions whereas transcription Factor footprints that that we find in in in multiple cell types tend to be you know located in in in the centers or more evenly distributed throughout accessible regions and so we hypothesize that maybe you know it's the differences in Access ability in the in the flanks of an accessible region sort of generally that is what's conferring cell type specificity right so you have you know an accessible region then you have a nucleosome gets kicked out it certainly makes the accessible region a little bit bigger you have now you have a transcription Factor binding sites is exposed to a transcription factor in the nucleus um and indeed about 85% of of accessible regions the variance so here dark color means more more variability across self context dark color 85% of accessible regions that variance is on the edges right a very small amount you about about 15% is more located within the center so Mo most of the time the variation accessibility is happening sort of on the edges of of an accessible region and so we are wondering okay well do do we see any transcription factors that you know sort of show bias in where they're located um you know do we do we see things that are almost always in the center or almost Bo on on the peripheries and we find this transcription Factor PCP this entire family um is highly preference preferentially located within the centers of acrs and I've also highlighted here a transcription Factor called leafy which is the only known Pioneer factor in plants so to me this was kind of a curious observation which stemmed the next test so we took all those fine mapped qtl and we said are there any um transcription Factor footprints when we when when they have a qtl in them that have an outsized effect on overall accessibility of that region and if we we do an enrichment test we find that again the TCP transcription factors the entire family is is highly enriched for for having large effects on accessibility and so it kind of gives us this model here where if you have a variant in a non-tcp transcription Factor footprint you might get a little bit of change in accessibility but not not much whereas if you have a variant a variant in a TCP transcription Factor binding site has a drastic effect on accessibility and and to us this was really exciting because PCP we we don't know any Pioneer factors outside of leafy in in any plant species and so trying to come up with this is something that my lab is interested in sort of following up on um is trying to map what what are Pioneer factors in in plants all right I'm going to try to go over this uh really quickly but we're also um trying to to find ways to democratize single cell approaches um one way you can do that is using combinatorial indexing so this was work done with shiau 2 and Seline zong at the um at the Chinese University of Hong Kong um basically it's it's comori indexing but we we did it in Plants um and it gives really good quality data better than 10x we have and and part of the trick here was that we used a modified tn5 enzyme it's a little bit bulkier much less likely to get spous Integrations um and so the sort of the gist take away from this you get slightly higher signal to noise which we measure by the proportion of reads that are within Peaks or within accessible chromatin regions um we get about the same number of cells recovered it's a lot cheaper you don't need any proprietary uh methods or instruments to to generate this data but that kind of led the way for the next um sort of innovation that that um Bob's lab and and and sort of what I um hope to get help with because I don't have as as good of hands as as Schwan I used to make all the Single Cell libraries in lab and then Schwan joined and then once we saw the quality of his I I wasn't allowed to touch the the chromium anymore but um so what Schwan and I came up with was a way to massively try you know stemming from the the observation that you could you could pull lots of genotypes together and and deconvolute those genotypes later we realized that we could just use the the tagmentation reaction itself to uniquely index cell so here we're in and I should also mention here that this method U we weren't the first to do it um Darren covich's group in Arizona uh their pre-print came out about a month before us um and there are some subtle differences in in in how the method works but it's the principally the same but the way it works is we'll uniquely label um about 10,000 nuclei within an individual well using different combinations of forward and reverse barcodes on on tn5 and then massively overload the 10x chip so in this case showing you we did about 20,000 nuclei we've know now that we can go up to almost 400,000 nuclei um and so we're getting lots and lots of nuclei within droplets but the chance that two nuclei share the same tn5 barcodes is very low right and so in this way we can we can sort of double dip and and get uh and get labeling much later or get get labeling as a second round that allows us to have much higher throughput and so we we apply this to uh different genotypes so the rows here represent different genotypes of maze um I want to show you that that we're able to First deconvolute those cells based off of their their tn5 barcodes right so those each well ID is known because of the combination of forward and reverse adapters um then we can also look at you know how well do those do those nuclei match um our expectation on on genetic variation right and so we get about 90% of of nuclei that are perfect match to our EX act expectation um and part of the reason it doesn't match perfectly is in addition to to doublets where or or collisions I should say we also get a little bit of contamination from index hopping which um is kind of a headache with the with the newer uh flow cells but um data looks great you know we can get about 100,000 cells from one 10x reaction which is about a tenfold now we know we can get up a 20-fold increase on the throughput um you know we get slightly lower number of Integrations per cell but we get a higher signal to noise ratio and this is also known for sequential rounds of barcoding that those things tend to tend to result in in somewhat less or a loss of complexity all right so you learned some single cell stuff that that makes you know we're learning how to uncover more plant biology I know we're all really fascinated by plants now and we'll leave the room all wanting to study maze uh I showed you that a lot of the trait variation or or or yeah the trade associate genetic creation is are located within cell type specific accessible regions a lot of sequence uh variation particularly within regulatory regions in maze the chromat and qtl are highly cell type specific um we think that these TCP transcription factors are are acting as Pioneer factors but this is something my lab is following up on um and then of course there's you know this this movement to try to democratize and and make single cell experiments more affordable because right now it's just it's just not um and my startup knows it because it's been disappearing really quickly but yeah so I think I've I've taken up all my time I definitely need to to thank a bunch of people um for you know for supporting me and and giving me a place and space to to do science and as well as actually helping with science so Bob schmidtz was was my advisor at University of Georgia he just finished his his hhmi interview and he's I hope breathing normally again with a reduced heart rate um Schwan helped me a whole lot with with Library preps um and and has done a little bit of analysis our collaborators at rugers uh who did a lot of the did all the Institue work and then Seline and and shiau at C HK um they also helped with a lot of the the technological innovation and of course my funding part of this was partially funded by by NSF as when I was a postto and then also my k99 r00 Z I'm still funding some of this work and then um of course I have to thank um you know Michigan for for allowing me to have a lab and and sort of gambling on me so I guess with that I'll I'll take more questions if we have any
