um amy pianta from icpsr at the university of michigan icpsr is a data archive that is within the institute for social research we are a social science data repository and i am a research scientist there i'm actually as i look through the the list of participants i see a number of you that i i recognize from other things around campus so um welcome to my talk today um the talk that i'm giving today is about what icpsr is doing to begin to add capacity to add eeg data to our repository because of course we are known for taking in and making available social science data and not eeg data and so i do have a pilot project with others from the university of michigan and elsewhere from midas so one of the pods projects to do some preliminary work to begin to understand how icpsr would need to amend its tools and processes to begin to take eeg data in in a more understandable way so it sounded like a really good topic for this kind of seminar so i'm a sociologist by training so i fit in really well with the social science data repository it also means that i don't know um a whole lot about eeg data from the point of view of having collected it and worked with it it's not something that i've done um i know a much more much more about traditional social science data sets like like surveys um and so waveform data like eeg data is is new to me and so i'm just going to start with the caveat that i'm really impressed when i go to talks and people talk outside their discipline and sound so knowledgeable and smart about those things that are outside of their discipline i'm not sure i'm there yet with eeg data so so bear with me if you have very specific questions about this data format i may not be able to answer them in fact that's a really good um a really good bet but hopefully i can tell you um about the tools and repository infrastructure and how we're orienting that um to be able to take in eeg data but the expertise for eeg lies elsewhere so with that let me tell you a little bit about our our project team um so my co-conspirator um on this project um is an eeg expert uh aylav isbell um ayliff was a postdoc when um at the university of michigan when we began um thinking about um ways to uh begin to support eeg data data better and she was very excited about the idea of a place like icpsr being the home for eeg data as opposed to other solutions that i'll talk more about in a little bit so she has since ended her postdoc and taken a job at uc merced in california so she is now a junior faculty person there but like i said she is my co-conspirator the co-pi on the on the pods project is bill gehring who is one of her senior faculty mentors in psychology here at the university of michigan and not directly involved with the pods project but hopefully down the road as we think about scaling up um what we learned from the work we're doing in this project uh pam davis keene oops i've spelled that wrong no e at the end of keen will um help ayliff and i and bill uh think about scaling this up with um pursuing additional funding from icpsr end of things there's two people who help me and so one is aaron meyer who's on um the the call today she's our data project manager um and keeping all of the activities going forward at um michigan and under um ayla and tamar tamara uh kawasme kwasmi sorry excuse me tamara is a data curator um at icpsr um who came to us from um wayne state where she had worked with a lot of brain data and so we've really used tomorrow's expertise as well as we've gotten further into this project so let me tell you a little bit about eeg data in case it's new to you so what i'm talking about is not just eeg data but eeg data that developmental scientists collect so developmental scientists like like alif and and and bill and and and pam um but really um developmental scientists of course are interested in lots of outcomes that um relate to uh brain function um and the electrochemical activity in the brain is something that is uh readily picked up and measured for probably the last hundred years by uh by using sensors that are positioned around the brain as you're seeing in this picture to amplify and measure those electrochemical activities of the brain and measure them in waveform data and so one of the things we know about eeg data is that it's really good at temporal resolution so when you want to study things of the brain that have temporal change or variance to them they're it's it is the a really good method um obviously it's only one of many types of um ways that we study and measure brain activity um pet scans [Music] functional mri those are all also important and some of those have greater spatial resolution that's really important to form and function of the brain um compared to eeg but eeg itself has a lot of advantages that i'll talk about again from my vantage point so in the realm of developmental science there are several different ways that eeg data are used primarily it's used in in clinical research especially in the pursuit of capturing and studying pediatric disorders and so eegs are really easy to use for populations that can't be stuck in an fmri very easily like children who wouldn't be able to tolerate that as much because the eeg sensors can be can be worn by children and also as they pursue other normal activities in their lives so you can collect the data when somebody's still or in motion and so you see a lot of clinical research being supported by the collection of eeg data same on some of the basic research questions that developmental scientists have as they look at the effects of things like what happens in school and how does that affect brain brain development or brain outcomes that we can study like attention um and and actually our pilot data set has has very much that um kind of bent to it it's also really useful for studying whether the clinical or educational interventions that we have to affect things like how people perform in school whether those things are efficacious or not and of course there's in its original use um was for clinical applications um for the detection of epilepsy and whatnot it's still used very strongly in that as well as things like um uh um uh sleep and um other other clinical outcomes as well amy this brian yeah later i'll show you something really cool uh on a device but uh earlier in the week i was hearing that eeg especially these newer more portable devices uh will have use in helping us understand how people are suffering from cognitive disorders and you know and help us classify alzheimer's patients and people with dementia and stuff like that so there i think that you know it's going to balance you know all these pediatric applications what i'm seeing is that as the techniques become more readily available cheaper and maybe even at home i can show you something you know we're likely going to see an explosion of those kinds of things i just want not to interrupt but i just thought that might be useful information yeah absolutely i exactly and i think as some of the algorithms we have to detect kinds of functional changes become more nuanced i think that's where some of those like applications are becoming much more used and then again a lot of populations um have a hard time um tolerating an fmri and so um it is also scanning so for example um yeah this one company which i'll tell you about a little later you know what they what they're what what they seem to be doing is you know for some of this alzheimer's like diagnostic validation stuff as an example you know pet scanning which is you know expensive you know somewhat invasive you know you have to take a radio nuclide and so on and so forth you know uh you know is uh there's access issues disparity issues you know this would be and it could be an alternative for stuff like that too for confirmatory diagnosis for things like alzheimer's disease and things like that so i'll shut up now but that's that's really one thing i learned earlier this week i didn't know brain injuries concussions this kind of stuff so there's a lot of applications okay thank you brian i love that you're filling in some of the well we're up we're a team yeah um yeah you know and the equity issue is actually really interesting um and icpsr has been spending a lot more time thinking about data equity issues and one of the things that like you were just saying that i've learned along the way about eeg data is that there are a lot of researchers and teams around the country who can stand up and run an eeg but they don't have access to an fmri right and so they may be a neuroscientist with good questions in pursuing a research agenda but the fmri is out of reach for them and so to the extent that science obviously you know at michigan we have both going on but um but but for but for smaller schools that don't necessarily have med schools and access to um this kind of technology we see a lot of um data collections um from scientists there relying on eeg so 100 what you said brian um the thing that's worrying to developmental scientists who are collecting eeg data is that it seems like each person is collecting it anew that the the the eeg data that this particular discipline is collecting are particularly not findable accessible interoperable and reusable like we're hoping that all data becomes um down the road and so um i'll talk a little bit about some of the uh reasons for that a lot of the things that are true of eeg data um and what has been limiting to sort of the advance of scientific science in some of these areas comes from again these these small research teams who have relatively small samples access to eeg equipment collecting data using and developing their own protocols to do that using equipment which varies from place to place team to team different equipment manufacturers different settings of the equipment all of those things have really meant that eeg researchers have not been able to have a standard product that they might contribute to a larger endeavor to put data put to put their individual data sets into something that would um overcome some of the statistical power limitations that their particular study might have it's also like i said harder to collect data from children it's a good method for children compared to other parts of the life cycle but at the same time samples even of children tend to be pretty small in the developmental research area that um that alif and i are hoping to make some changes um about how how this gets done yeah but also more with children you know there's more controls in terms of uh you know hipaa and stuff like that you know it's a little harder to get a kid david yes and then harder to overcome some of the challenges when you have that of of sharing those data in some kind of a collaborative right yeah i think that's really true um some of the other challenges that that worried a left when she came to icpsr with this with this idea is that while there are other eeg repositories and places to potentially share eeg data that the eeg data of developmental scientists was a little bit different from others in the sense that those repositories lacked infrastructure to adequately protect and share the other kinds of data that developmental scientists are so good at collecting so the demographic information the behavioral information that that detailed information about who people are and how they change over time and in the settings that we're studying them in and most of the you know places like open neuro are are good these days about taking in eeg data um but it's taking in eeg data without that broader context of the other components of the data that icpsr is good at um and so the hope would be that we'd be able to do both the eeg data but also the other data so that for if we think of the whole data system we'd be able to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of the people who participate in these studies and give their valuable time uh with um a broader group um and then there certainly are challenges um of developmental scientists in in it's still a pretty even though there are um places and and standards for for sharing eeg data to get their data into this standardized data format and so there may be something sort of particular about developmental scientists um not being quite ready to um embrace what i'll talk about in a in a minute which is things like the bidsy eg format and so what we want to begin to lay out in our in our pods project is um setting out the requirements for a developmental eeg repository that's capable of addressing all of these issues um so we were were looking to establish the requirements for an archive that would curate developmental eeg data securely that it would assess the compatibility of existing data sets and these other parts of the data package that i just talked about that it would incorporate analysis pipelines for standardizing that data and allow for secondary users down the line to be able to ask novel questions with these existing data um so our first aim in this project is to create and implement an infrastructure for archiving data at least that's the big goal and of course in a pilot project we're going to get so far down the road for creating and implementing infrastructure it's not that big of a project but borrowing on what we know and learn and we have consultants from um from from bids and connections to open neuro along with our expertise at icpsr with all those other kinds of data types that we know so much better we think we can make some progress so really what we'll be doing here for this aim of building infrastructure would be to at least establish the requirements for a user interface that's going to allow icpsr to offer an easy way for this research community to give their data to icpsr and for secondary users down the road to use it um and so one of the other aims besides writing requirements and how we actually get to the writing of requirements um is that we're going to we are actually in the process we've taken in our first pilot data set um and uh and making progress with understanding how we have to align icpsr with this data type and the standard that is out there so hopefully you're convinced that what we're doing um is going to be perhaps better than what others might do um because of some of the unique capabilities of of icpsr we think it will be among one of the first neuroscience data repositories that can offer the level of data security and curation that icpsr is known for it certainly would be new for icpsr we don't have anything like that we have a very tabular data focused archive and and some other data types but not eeg data and it will be among the first to offer some integrated integration and systematic assessment of some of the different processing pipelines and this i can talk much less about because that is a lifts area of the project the pilot data that we're bringing into icpsr to begin understanding how we're going to adjust our tools is um it turns out we had others in mind but but the one we are um using now and actually that we're about to release is the ilisten study that alif herself collected um and it's a study of associations between things like socioeconomic adversity class learn classroom auditory environments so there's actually auditory data actually in this data package and the development of neural mechanisms um that suppresses distraction among kindergartners you can imagine kindergartners and their ability to do well in paying attention in the classroom um is partly about all the noise stimulus that's heading towards them so this particular data package is interesting because it has all the requirements of what we're hoping to work with it has a wealth of of parent survey data and behavioral data from the kids as well as the eeg files and so it's going to allow us to learn about what we need to do so i'm going to turn and talk a little bit about the tools that we generally use at icpsr so you can see sort of what we're up against in terms of bringing in um this square peg to our round hole like my ambitious title said so the first tool of any data set that's coming to icpsr that anyone interfaces with is the deposit manager tool and really this is a tool mainly used by outside um research teams and staff to give data that to give icpsr their data package so the depositor generally is using the tool it's going to provide study information that kind of information is used to build the citation for the study the description of the project what its scope is its methodology what its related bibliography are so things that are going to be pretty common to eeg research for the most part it also includes a file upload function to upload upload the files so none of this is going to be too hard to to amend um to take eeg data in so i just have just two quick screenshots of what this tool looks like because it's the one tool that's easy to show to the outside world so any user who's uploading data to icpsr can kind of see all of their uploads you can see here i've got three potential uploads going either data sets that i've given to icpsr or things that are in progress or things that icps are potentially turned away when you dive into any one of these particular deposits and interface with the actual form what you see are places where at the top where the the files for the data package have been uploaded and then lots of sections where we collect a lot of structured metadata or information about the study that like i said is used to build that citation for the data of the authority of who collected it and who should get credit um as well as other things about the scope the methodology the publication so each of these plus signs rolls out into a lot of fields um that are at this point very focused on social science data types and tabular data types but this information that we collect in the form becomes the basis of all the other tools that the study goes through as it goes through the repository so the information collected in that deposit form is then pushed into what our staff use which is a metadata editor and this is where we do our standardization work using our particular metadata standard which is the data documentation initiative to edit the data so that it is one of the key parts of becoming findable accessible interoperable and reusable so our staff are using the metadata editor to you know round out the information that the user has supplied to apply controlled vocabularies um to make edits enhancements spelling error spelling corrections um looking at sort of other things in the data package to fill out the study description about the project so that's the the first or the sorry the second tool but the first sort of staff specific tool uh that we have to think about when we think about bringing in the eeg data and then there are two more tools that are really heavily used and i see psir and i'll mention that because it comes becomes important to how i think we're going to approach eeg data so the the third tool is a data assessment tool and this is a really fantastic tool that icpsr has that really is used for spss files which is the bulk of what we get added um through our ingest system through our deposit form so when people give us data they're often giving us data that are either spss or something that we can readily translate into spss so this particular tool does a diagnostic of the files that were submitted and really forms a little bit of the basis of what our staff are going to do to standardize that data so it's going to show what are the components of the the data package this spss you know package of files that are missing where there's labeling issues components that might cause errors down the road for some of the other tools that we use and also some direct some information about identifiers that come particularly from open-ended responses that might be in that tabular file so all of those things kind of get red light warnings um yellow i think it's red yellow green that gets fed to the staff and becomes the basis of of work that we do subsequently with other tools so after um an editing and managing process one of the le which is pretty manual at icpsr it's very manual but the last tool that completes the curation workflow at icpsr again to think about replicating what it does is our conversion and documentation tool and again this is spss based so we already had it as an spss file along the way um but at this point it is an spss file that then produces all the different statistical tabular statistical data packages that are popular with the push of a button if there's a hundred data files spss data files in a package it does it all at once it also creates this ddi based variable level metadata that's extracted from these input data files which becomes the basis for code books and for online analysis capabilities all the things that we're facilitating to make data fair gets done with this tool and it's um that ddi metadata actually generates a very beautiful standard code book for for that study that's been pushed through this final tool of icpsr's ecosystem um so turning back to the question of the eeg data itself um so um as i mentioned there are uh the bids eeg standard is certainly the agreed upon by the eeg community and neuroscience community it's the standard with which um the community has agreed data should be organized um described and shared with one another so the bids container that we know a lot about because it's a standard that's been published itself is very um robust in and of itself and so what icpsr would need to do to be able to capture a data set that was already in the bids format would be to do very minimal changes to that deposit form the metadata editor don't even need to ditch the spss files because these are not spss files so those other tools um in order to be able to um capture specific information about the eeg package so pretty small changes to we're thinking and hoping at this point to those first two tools that i talked about um and then um really where we think we will focus our work both our remaining work in the current pilot project but then also um the subsequent work that this becomes for for icpsr and future projects that we have will be our is really about um engaging this developmental science community that collects eeg data to be able to bolster its own expertise to produce these bids eeg format files so icpsr's model because we've done this for probably nearly 60 years has been said like tell the researcher with its spss file don't worry just give it to us we know what to do with it um so that's kind of great for icpsr we have pretty robust ways of doing that and lowering the cost of doing that for the researcher and doing it well but as we're thinking about a newer data type for us like eeg do we want to recreate that do we want to become the experts in um doing all that standardization work and organization work as we do for uh tabular data files and i think the answer is maybe no again because there's these agreed upon standards agreed upon um workflows for um for allowing the research teams themselves to do that kind of conversion um and so i think that's sort of the stealing the short answer of this um is that we're putting a lot of emphasis into understanding um how to take a typical data package that might or a file structure and folder structure that a developmental eeg scientist would have stored their work in in getting that to play nice with this bids eeg format and then we're hoping that this then allows us to be able to allow the researcher to focus on the eeg part giving it to icpsr in a way that's more standardized leveraging this bids eeg standard and then as i said putting the focus on training and outreach that helps the researchers to put their data into that format it then means that we're making only minor changes to the repository infrastructure and still allows us to focus on what we do well which is this robust handling of all the other things in that package that the developmental scientist would have created which includes our ability to handle restricted use data sets and this becomes important and i think i have that on the next slide to talk about and so there are um several things that came up already um we i think we it's been a year that the project was awarded um but of course with kovid um we're extending by by six months um and so we're essentially halfway through what we want to be through through at this point but even in the six months that we've had we've learned a lot of things about disclosure risk that comes from these developmental science data sets with the with the one study that we've um ingested and curated so far from alif um so one was we had intended to do one of bill gehring's um eeg collections bill pam davis keen we were hoping that that was going to be our data set it was a bigger data set and and the informed consent that was written for those data didn't allow for data sharing of those eeg data and so we were faced with either reconsenting asking them to reconsent their study participants to be able to follow through with sharing their data with icpsr or look for another study and luckily we had our our plan b and that was a smaller study where her informed consent did address data sharing so so we went with that but that's important right so a lot of the developmental scientists that we've been talking to are going to face this problem and so um we certainly are pursuing with the university of michigan irb um some guidance to help developmental scientists avoid that problem going forward and potentially have a route for redo for doing re-consent so the data sharing is possible um the other thing that we found is that um we actually had disagreements so the curators uh the curation team at icpsr um took in the package that alef put through our deposit manager and then they began their work and they came to the conclusion at the end that we would restrict the eeg file and make available the the social and behavioral data which was interesting to us because what we've heard in from aylif along the way was wave form data of the brain is not very disclosive so it was kind of curious that the end result was we would restrict the waveform data and make publicly available for download everything else and as we went further with the curation team in this process what we found is that um the social and behavioral data and some of the metadata like how the study was described like where it was conducted um which was in the university of michigan you know clinics and whatnot actually posed disclosure risk for the whole data package um and that by doing that it was became a particular concern from the curations team point of view that um the waveform data because it was a biologic form of data potentially um should not be shared so i think what we've come yeah this is kind of crazy right so we're flipping we're flipping the script yeah amy is this because the some kind of identity first patient identifiable signatures and the eeg scan that you know makes makes it uh you know makes it identifiable i mean what's behind this it's actually just pretty benign it's the um it's it's some of the indirect identifiers that are very detailed about these families which have given a pause because we think that certainly a family could go in and pick out themselves um and when that happens we get a little more cautious with the data so there's very few people in this study right like it's like a typical eeg study it doesn't have a lot of people so if you know again icpsr is pretty agnostic when it comes to letting people use the data if staff or families themselves that interacted with people in the study were to access the data through icpsr it's potentially identifiable but then that says to me you know what just like openneuro makes all of the eeg data open to open for for use because it's not disclosed that's where we should do that as well because that's where those data might be leveraged with other data that are in open neuro in other places but what we should do is that if the user wants to access that rich detailed information about the participants about these kids and their families and the schools some some school data there that that's what we should restrict and then eeg data used in combination with that would be done in one of our more restricted ways data is kind of a limited data set and then yeah which is would be less restricted and then if they needed other items with that then there would be other controls yep all right thank you for that that makes sense yeah and so um like i said the the so really i think what our direction going forward with these incoming development with these incoming eeg data sets i'll just even broaden it to say eeg no matter what just when it's coming from um is to look at the you know the metadata so how much detail is provided in that you know the other data components the phenotypic data right um as behavioral data as well as the metadata about how the study is described if this study is small scale in nature it just makes our sensitivity higher with these other two criteria what's in the data and and how much information is there smaller numbers of participants sort of ratchets up our our concern with the data set at least that is our current model at icpsr and then of course that means that when any of those more revealing parts of the data collection are going to be used we're going to restrict data access um so here's our remaining tangible study goals so the data set that i just talked about is is coming out from icpsr but these are sort of four requirements documents reports resource guides that we're also considering to be these endpoints of our study that we'll be working on over the next six months so we will have some assemblance from alif herself that is her um shorthand about how developmental scientists can prepare their eeg data in the bids eeg standards so like how to go from what they have to what it should look like second again from alif requirements for the icpsr deposit manager tool about how we can expand the metadata that we're beginning to collect in that tool and then pushing on to the metadata editor for things that are more eeg specific and then from tamara and from aaron who've been working more on getting the data curated guidelines for the curation of those data by our curation team at icpsr so that the next time we get a data system we don't sort of data package we don't sort of start with the same fundamental um you know misunderstanding of the files as we did this time right we can learn from the fact that the eeg data usually aren't that problematic to share openly but if there's real risk in the rest of the data sets that that's where the restrictions should probably be and then finally um uh we are mostly the the it team at icpsr um is working with the the rest of us to write requirements for icpsr's data models so that we can begin to amend our data model to be able to fit things like the eeg data and the bids data format um so that the data are truly fair so like to give more parts uh more more support from the tools and workflows and processes at icpsr to get closer to fair eeg data in a way that's as supported as possible by the repository the other um thing that we did actually before even starting the study was um to ask people if this whole approach made sense and so we have 50 over 50 developmental eeg labs worldwide that signed on to our request to say is this a necessary piece of infrastructure that you need to be able to share your data and so this is a example of the teams that have that we've that we've been in contact with who've said that this is the critical missing piece um to sharing their developmental eeg data um at a much bigger scale so we're excited that we'll be able to also marshal that community interest as we move forward so our final things of course are all the work that i just talked about getting that done um and then we have been actively exploring multiple grant mechanisms at nih and nsf with plans to do writing over the next six to 12 months for a variety of deadlines that are coming up so that we can take these requirement documents and put them into implementation at icpsr hopefully so i think with that i'm going to stop sharing my screen so i can see any questions that might have come up in the chat but maybe they're not there but feel free to both ask questions and um put things in the chat let me jump in for a second amy yeah go ahead brian why i i just want to show you something that i thought was kind of interesting uh let's see so i these are a couple websites that have popped up in my attention this is called nero steer these guys are out of uh israel and you know what they've done is they've created this eeg band here you know so one thing i want to do is say that there is likely going to be some disruptive technologies and i believe this is a disruptive technology that's going to revolutionize how we uh you know use ee to collect eeg data this could be personal you know a person could buy this and track their own stuff the musicians are you know as shown here i'm really into this uh yeah we have an arts archive at icpsr so perfect you can see that uh you know there's different data collection sites here this here is another company uh here and i believe this is in korea imed sync uh where you can see uh you know kind of more classical uh you know hood coming on there but really good software you know this is you know what i'm thinking is uh you know and these two companies are really focused in you know they have you know streamlined all the data collection apparatus they made it cheaper faster better all good stuff and uh you know i think what you're going to see is a uh an explosion of this technology you know in uh you know for cognitive you know uh function analysis with uh dementia and alzheimer's like i was mentioning before and obviously it's going to have an effect on what we're doing with the peds so i think this is just going to get online and it's just going to make this it's positioning the technique to maybe explode because it was way more experimental and kind of you know you had to be a real specialist i i i think my sense is that somebody's going to pick this up it's likely going to be the neurocognitive folks and some and i think for autism spectrum uh classification and you mentioned that i think it's just going to be huge so it's going to move way beyond epilepsy that's all i'm saying mm-hmm you know what's happening urging right now so i just want to bring that to everybody's attention i think so what i would say is your thing is timely and uh you know we should be looking for definitely partnerships and be happy to work with you you know with our mishar unit and icpsr as well as you know the health system you know i can help with that but anyway that's all i had i'm seeing um vincent's talking about calico and google brain yep these are all really helpful comments and yeah yeah on the longevity side yeah did i hear somebody else i thought i heard a voice maybe with a question or maybe it was just pointing me to the chat any other questions for amy or aaron who's here yeah um oh okay yeah uh you know i'm just wondering if um you know uh you know i see psr as an international research resource so you know my senses are you getting any information from um are any inquiries or interests or is it too early to tell i mean you know uh you know i'm just wondering about that and maybe connecting up with some of these i was googling around and you had mentioned one but you know there are some repositories of eeg data around on the web sure yes right which is why we've made our niche developmental science right because it is sort of like the the the part of it that makes sense because you know there's lots of places that can um you know lots of even generic repositories can just take in bids format eeg data right it could be fig share it could be dataverse it can be any of the dryad right any of those actors but for developmental science where so much of the goodies lie in the other files that we are good at we're hoping that that's what makes this compelling to um to nsf or to nih as we expand what we're looking to do so that's you know pam's pretty convinced that it's not going to happen without a place like icpsr being attached to it um in a way that would really advance the science and developmental science sorry you know all this aging stuff is developmental science it fits in nicely i mean we often think about more like kids but it's more right i mean it could be nia it doesn't have to be an ichd exactly like n.i.a you guys have done well with that so it has a super again hector e's work at calico he is actually one of the leaders in uh google branding calico in terms of doing advanced waveform analysis and
