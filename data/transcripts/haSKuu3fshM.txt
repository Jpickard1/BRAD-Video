this is the last seminar so obviously for this year we will be breaking of course over winter break and I believe we start up again on January 14th and then we'll go through the end of April for next semester so there is sort of a pseudo sign-in sheet we'll pass that around the official ones are sort a while right now with the construction going on so if you could sign in though that would be great and with that I'd like to introduce Wallace Chan it's gonna talk to us about ligand based virtual screen for g-protein coupled receptors okay thanks for the introduction Marci so so my name is Wallace Chan as Marcy said here I'm with a PCC student in the department of biological chemistry and my mentor is mr. yang zing so um I'm gonna start the talk off here with a little introduction to GPCRs and everything related to gpcrs so g-protein coupled receptors otherwise GPCRs which I'll call them from this point onwards are a really large super family of receptors in human proteome they're they're responsible for many really important physiological processes such as I mean obviously vision you have a Confederate flight response you have analgesia so you know they're obviously they're very large family of proteins and not surprisingly they're also very often commonly associated with many sorts of diseases such as cancer and diabetes either through maybe mutations industry and in the primary structure or maybe maybe an overactive promoter and whatnot so so not surprisingly these are really common in popular drug targets so let's let's put this little bit in perspective here so the human proteome has roughly 20,000 plus or minus or so proteins right so out of these here in humans will watch in Hue but this is in humans and so out of these roughly 825 to rub tippy 20,000 it really depends like radiator source our GPCRs and out of these hundred 825 GPCRs roughly 113 of these are actually drunked or drunkle meaning like there have been drugs released for these gpcrs and furthermore roughly 30% of GPCRs our third drugs I'll mark today target gpcrs the this number really varies between 30 to 50 percent depends on other sources that you read from but but this is you know gently with estimates so therefore it's a very you know attractive target for drug development now in development direct design what have you still as today is the high-throughput screen and what is high-throughput screening essentially you have a target protein in this case receptor usually and you screen a really large library of compounds chemicals against it to see whether or not there will be in effect so this can be like you know thousands to millions depending on your what kind of campaign that you have but this can be very expensive process it can be very time-consuming and also very laborious so so there have been methods developed recently but then I tried to address these these drawbacks method here as a complementary parallel approach and which is known as computer-aided drug design CAD and this method essentially aims to predict whether Kennedy compound will interact with your your receptor structure or its target in general in any way and it's and usually uses a combined approach like a bioinformatics slash chemo diplomatic approach right and so in general we refer to these these approaches as virtual screens and in virtual screens can have their two main sort of ways in which you can approach the person methodology and you have what's called structured base screens and you have ligand based screens and I'm going to go into each of these and just talk a little bit about what these are so first we have a structure based virtual screen and what this is essentially is it uses information from either the structure of a known protein that you know the structure from PDB or if you don't know the structure you might even go so as for the misty's a model which can be very treacherous sometimes but not recommended and then like so what you do is you you have your receptor and you screen your perceptive structure here against like a whole library of virtual compounds so so these are these are chemicals molecules in computer transform essentially they're in a computer and then you you docked them and then you score them that based on you can happy like physical physical chemical parameters like how will the ligand fist into the to the binding pocket if it's a receptor and you can score you can score it from like you know best best to where score and get some candy compounds for testing and another way here is a ligand based virtual screen so let ligand based methods here are very different in the sense that you don't use any structural information from the protein whatsoever and but instead of using the structure you use the actual chemicals themselves so like the ligands that actually are known to bind and illicit activity with your protein structure you can target protein essentially right so one of the ways to do this is by permit before mapping and a formative for is essentially you can think of it as a DEA description of of the chemical features of your ligand right and the disk and this can be anywhere from like you know like it - like hydrophobic regions of your ligand hydrogen bond donors or acceptors things such as this and this this is one method that people use sometimes to screen through and try to find similar ligands chemically simoleons oops now another way is is by just chemical similarity which is sort of similar to the previous one but instead of using before we use we use other methods to help abstract our ligands are chemicals right and and this and this principle is essentially based on the fact that if you have kept chemicals compounds right with similar structure then you're gonna have probably a similar function essentially so so one sort of example this is morphine right so everybody's favorite OPI droid so it's oh this is so codeine is also another opioid here but I mean if you see that their destructive very similar they also have several function they both by the me opioid receptors so this is just like one of those assumptions never me for the Lincoln based virtual screen now so in order to actually conduct a Lego based virtual screen before I go into this here I want to make it clear that though today it will be presented it's going to be based on like a base to purchase grids so one of the requirements for the ligand based virtual screens here is that you have to have a set of known data essentially so you need some input in order to be able to get some predictions some output essentially right so one of the challenges here really is in and collecting all really relevant data for for the method right here because it's scattered around everywhere on the internet right so it can be pretty disordered and structured data so so it's a daunting task in terms of GPCR databases with pharmacological data that I can use for for these screens there have been databases out made already such as lead it stands for GPS your ligand database and GPCRs are free but the best thing about these days is I mean they were good for the time but no more updates and we'll see why this is such a big problem so on the x-axis here is the is the data sets from like a certain time from one chemical database called Campbell and Campbell is a database that houses a lot of you know pharmacological data and whatnot and this is just you think you can things like prediction in time otherwise is here is the is a number of entries you have so activities so I just what kind of experimental values they have right so right around this appearing here is when Glade I stopped opening their database summer in 2010 and that's the amount of data that we see in Campbell right and then right around this time here GP chefs are free you know they stopped updating everything here so we had this huge data right here that's just lying around that's you know it's it's just not really been some sense so so obviously you know I mean there's a lot of data that's missed right here so you know why upon the opportunity to Train subsets this year so which leads me to the next sort of aim here which is extraction of glass database so glass databases so the whole objective here is to construct the database essentially to help sunset all the gpcr related pharmacological data to together all GPCR related data together also ligand based data right and which would be used and also be very useful in computational chemistry or computational biology efforts uh yeah this is the logo here I gotta say thank you my my wife actually helped out a little bit with the logo design here not really too good with that but it's glass dance for GPCR like an association database and up here with done collaboration with a Hong Joo Zhang which was not present today it wasn't able to make it for some reason but um a very good programmer very very good guy so anyways how is glass database constructed let's get into it here so first we start off starting for is from uniprot right so any product everybody knows everybody's favorite protein database right so i acquire essentially all the GPR data as much as I can from uniprot as a starting point you know slightly different IDs fast a sequences for the primary structure gene names etc etc and then the next thing here is if I used information primarily the using messing up with the the identifier the protein identifier CA prod IDs to the chemical databases namely temple Bunny BB are you far drug back drunk bank and PDS pieces so these are the primary sources of data that I use for my for the pharmacological data right and so I filter these ones for for all the GPC related entries essentially so I pretty much ask whether or not this data's gpcr related yes passes through this looking at this ligand in this entry here of this experiment entry had become an identifier yes passed through then also acquire the experimental data associated with so it can be anything from kis Katie's I see 50s and easy 50s anywhere to like you know just just really obscure just present inhibition of whatnot depending on the experiment and so afterwards I go back and I go back in a pumpkin and pumpkin is essentially like this one of the one of the 14 databases under NCBI that houses a lot of just really crept out of chemical information essentially and I go back in here and I find has essentially match up the ligand data with the ligands from the experiments that were found to be led to gpcrs so I just get all the information but as much as possible you know like chemical identifier you know like it's miles and she and she IDs or all match back here optional water partition coefficient predictions molecular waves after bond or acceptors and whatnot all these are all acquired from pubchem right here and then ultimately everything's put mainly verified to make sure there's no likely mistakes in the data gathering because sometimes just a port word of warning deal databases can change the format sometimes and then when you update a database you lose data you lose data like look what happened you know so so I mean no verification this is always important to check your data see if it's okay and then sand and the way this this database is organized here is it's just a very simplistic view of how it is but essentially we have a table here that's that's a target we that's the primary key here is linked to an association table we also have another legen table here where the primary keys in Chiqui its unique linked back to the association here and the association table here it's consists of all the different associations between between your GPCR and your and your ligand of interest which is represented by in Chiqui and this is associated back to like the experimental information so experimental data that that's that's that's found for this essentially and the current statistics as of at the we just went out dated this year we have roughly 3056 gpcrs 825 those inhuman 687 of those actually have experimental data in terms of ligands we have tuned to 76,000 roughly and out of those 192 thousand of those are our drug like aka a bit past the PSP's rule of five criteria and for drug ability and in terms of GPCR ligand entries this that the DES not rented round here is 440 1662 seven but overall we have sorry this is a this is by I flipped it around here we have a roughly 800,000 GB zillion entries out of those 400,000 four to forty thousand of those are unique and not surprisingly analyzing the the distribution of the database here most of these are rid of sin like GPCRs the Class A ones they make up about like over 90% of GPCRs anyways that nice so I mean it's not very surprising you also have a lot of a fair amount of class Class C data now it's glass database essentially you could search by ligand or you can search by gpcr or you're getting searched by GPC rolling up there so it's kind of hard to show by slide so I'm just going of like a really brief tech demo here to show what maybe she's capable of so what's up let's everybody have a GPS here let's throw it out here I'm sorry CR h OC rich okay alright so that's right here let's try this one here let's try the human one okay so essentially you search for the GPCR has all the information essentially put put into here and so you have your species genes so just like pretty much all the all the sort of like running all standard information we also have of conditions associated with this that are mined from therapeutic target database if you go down here for all for all the human targets we have a 3d 3d model if there's no defeat if there's no pdb structure available then there's going to be a GPS here structure model from its base gmod which is a database we have that's pretty much like the protective structures of all the human GPCRs if you go down here then that's going on all right so so you can look for the ligands that bind to it here so yeah like it's just a list of all the ligands so if you click on this guy here you get to go to the ligand page and this is essentially ligand page with all the via chemical information and any 2d structure here and and if we go back and you click on the glass IDs so this is the Association so you get the experimental information from here if you go all the way down then you can see that that this that this guy right here has one experimental value from from the study essentially so so this is essentially how this database can be used you can also download data to play with it if you want also I don't know why it's moving by itself all right so so essentially what we have here is we have well no we just will leave that in there it's just the PDB structure I mean we don't process it it's just for show so yeah okay so these so essentially the last database here you can search but GPCR each there's my ligand that there there's also a you can search by by chemical similarity or substructure if you want also which I didn't show just now but you can draw your chemical and it search search for it if you want all the ligands are available and SDF format so SDF is like guys it's just like I'm it's a computerized version if you're looking essentially in 3d format and their monthly updates and the database is fully available to public for download so you can you know do what you want with the data now the next thing here is a ligand based virtual screen so so essentially uh I finally have a data set I can use for gpcr excreting now so so essentially the goal of this year is that to perform invalidate a ligand based virtual screen using data from last database right essentially what this here is because Leppa said previously Lincoln based virtual screens can really benefit from like you know like known known data but not just known data like more importantly we wanted it actually you know like it's it's relevant like the ligands are rationed bioactive right so I have this so from glass here what I do is I gather all the ligands so I take a little against from glass database so I have all the experimental parameters associated with them right currently I only work with ki k be eg 50s and I see 50s so essentially have a cut-off value here for at 10 micromolar I'm sorry ki is an inhibition constant whereas KT is dissociation constant I'm sorry ki ki k is a constant get calculated from the ic50 be that the the inhibition at 50 percent essentially the concentrated need that they made to inhibit future percent of your population of GPCRs right so the cost takes catholic from that okay that's in the experimental conditions use the chain presov equation to essentially right and so essentially I've from this year I have a pool of bioactive ligands I sort of like you used to filter out here and also leggins here are are then converted into a what's called a molecular descriptor or chemical descriptor and what I use here is called a fp2 fingerprint from open babble so pretty much really generally like how this works is like the algorithm for this year so this is from open babble 4fp to fingerprint generation it starts from from every atom of your molecule here it starts from one and it goes out to seven seven atoms so it goes like one two three four five six seven right and for each for every one that goes out here and hashes that feature onto a Windows to 24 bit string essentially right so for one feature you're gonna have like one position on the bit string right one or two or three depending on how it's hashed and and then so you say and so for all these all these features here that are hashed their head they're all combined together for for each feature here into one 1024 bit string so for each of fries you each bit here of each bit or combination of this from represents one chemical substructure or like chemical feature you can think of it that way does that make sense to everybody hopefully so it's just a string of zeros and ones especially and and and the ones are the sort of like they just they denote some sort of a feat chemical feature okay and this is really more like what the data looks like when I do it so I start with like the SDF file for the ligand at hand here and using open babble I convert it into a decimal string for some reason they output hexadecimal so I have to convert it back into it into the binary from there so with a one knows twenty four bit binary string at the very end so so this guy here represents this guy essentially this does not include stereochemistry and it doesn't include its it's a very you can think of this as an abstraction of your molecule essentially right and the reason why this is this is used instead of like you know like you know like other methods here is because it's very fast and I have a lot of bouncing screens so this really saves a lot of time it's probably a little bit different because of the hydroxyl group there so you're gonna have a different hash that position and a half whether you have one well depends of the position in that case because because its path based so you start from like one then you move to next one you move to next one so if you have like occa o or o or if it's if it's this way then OCCC o or something like that and as opposed to like just just one you're gonna have that additional feature that the other one doesn't have some that you sum them up but but but if you have two hydroxyl groups that path okay so so that path is gonna be you have a different path that Dalton doesn't have right it's gonna be housed somewhere else so it's gonna be you're gonna have like maybe a couple more bits that are different right if there's still you're still going to get some similarity because you could you still still aromatic that the portion that's similar but you're gonna get the difference in where the hydroxyl groups are one versus two right okay so yeah so it's written that as one of those twenty four bit binary strings so the next step here it really is it is more like the by automatic approach combined with the chemo informatics so so so this part here essentially I use site blast in order to determine functionally similar GPCRs by by sequence identity essentially right so I blast and I used all the gpcrs I have from blast that I did that were denoted as bio actives so they had at least one ligand that was bio active right and let's say for example we have GPCRs a b c and d here and let's say after side blasting here we have B and D are considered homologous so in this case hopefully probably functionally similar because this really relies on the assumption that simpler gpcrs will bind similar ligands and so I do this for every GPCR and and eventually what happens is I get I go back to being toes gpcrs B and D and I take billions to the bioactive ligands that are associated with B and D come on pull them all together and to what's called a ligand profile so so what the leading profile is with my experiment here is the collection of all the ligands from from the from the related GPCR so essentially due to your query gpcr okay now the experimental design here for the validation of the screen is so I start here with the GPC respective ligands so I only test in this subset here because I have two knowns and I want to see if I can use the method to get the knowns back out essentially and the main sort of the main thing I want to do here for this experiment is to see whether or not I can only use the lickin's from related GPCRs and see if it still performs as well as if I still had the quit the ligands of the Crick CPC or spiked in until they can profile also right this is for no this is for all species socially I'm sorry there yet there could be some in there I haven't checked yeah yes that's true like the most of Class A ones or that I don't know how many of those are in the bioactive ligands here I could check it later on but the majority probably yeah probably not actually so yeah yeah but we pretty scary because humans so yeah so so so pretty much the whole gist of this is you're here I want to test that the the Legum profile with and without the the ligands from the query DPS here and so how does it work essentially what I screen against is a database called zinc so zinc stands for I think it's not commercial like the worst acronym in the world but it's it's a database developed by it's believed house and branch OJ's lab so I could already UCSF it's a really large data of purchasable compounds they have like over 35 million compounds they're all purchasable they also from like other vendors and whatnot so you have like very common compounds you have batik compounds you have just like anything out there you can find hopefully and everything is available in in an in an SDF format like 3d SDF or even like mol - which is available it which is perfectly like for docking it's already and then so I use I use the zinc eight database here and and also I spike in the reference ligands for for each gpcr that I'm testing against right so these are the reference compounds these are the compounds that are known to be bioactive essentially right and it and the whole point what I'm doing here is to try to fish these guys back out to see if I can use my ligand profile to be able to pull these guys back out right and I screen is i screen this against the ligand profile for the for the GPCR that I'm working with here so this is just for one GPCR right so so you can think of this is like up like a pairwise comparison of chemical similarities 15 obvious to all every single every single compound in here against every compound in here especially and I calculate the chemical similarity they cut the chemical similarities calculated using the what's called the ten Emoto coefficient I don't know if anybody's heard of that but it's another word for its Jakarta Jakarta index yes I find it yes yes so soon-jae so for every single guy here so every eye is every compound in this database so like one so like you know like six to eight thousand or something like that and and and for each of these here I calculate the the ten mo coefficient for each of these so J it's like each ligand in the profile TC I'll get into that it's typical vision yeah so so the calculation for at an mo kupo yeah so this is how it works sorry I'm not about to talk to talk about that right now yeah so so so we do what we do like it like a bit last comparison essentially against against two two molecules so we have 1020 we have what does 24 bit string for one another one dose story for visiting for another molecule we take those we compare them against each other to see how many of those ones match up right we want to see how similar they are so the calculation conformed here is that such here you can see all the bits that match up right so all the ones that like our Union Union I guess in this case so you have like Union here you mean here so it's 2 right and then you divide by so 4 is the number of bits and in one string and one molecule and the other one is 5 is the number of bits and the other molecule and then you subtract that by the union or intersection I guess like this yeah sorry yeah I get that switch to switched around it usually Thanks so essentially yeah so you divide that by that and you get point two nine this is on a scale of 0 to 1 so so what you get is so you can twenty nine point two nine you can think of it it's there twenty nine percent similar pretty much okay okay so so for so for each of these guys here and and so so for all of these lickings in the database so all the dal although all the compounds in zinc database and all the ligands in the reference compounds I essentially score them with a series of thirteen rules and compare how well they do essentially and then I rank them and I have to give a little bit of a rhotic option here the next 13 slider can be really really dry so it's just describing role service you know brace yourself so the first rule here that we use is called the pre some role and and this is a essentially we sum up all the all the ligands and the link profile like each position for every single ligands we take the average of like the this this column this column this column this column and I get a ligand profile that's sort of like this the calculation for the terminal coefficient is different here it's not doing bit so instead I'm just I'm doing essentially multiplication multiplication of the you know the one double one times this one that or something like that so so I'm essentially multiplying each position of your every target ligand luckily fingerprint versus your some ligand profile okay and the calculation is very similar not exactly the same but it's but you guys can sort of get the point from this right here and so this is one way one role that that I use here to sort of like helping validate the score is essentially the like one account click here from the des animaux coefficient right and the the max rule here is it's more or less so free source for every single leg into the leg and profile right so from before you that you know I do a pairwise comparison and all against all so this takes the maximum 10ml coefficient that I calculated from among your your ligaments in your leg and profile and use that as a score for your for your ligand in the zinc database essentially that's just a maximum the next rule here is the median so it's more or less along the same lines instead of the maximum I take the median and I find like what the median T z-score is so it's it's more or less just just the average add them all together divided by the number of ligands in the Lincoln profile right and the next rule here is a little bit a little bit more interesting it's it's it's essentially the average but the P here that I divide by is the number of ligands to have a TC score above 0.7 and and this is really they're just really help sort of like wait wait the lingam profile to have more ligands with that are actually more chemic chemical a similar essentially and the MMT rule is more or less the same that you're you're you're multiplying by the by the by the sum of all your your TC scores here so the ranking would be inverse essentially for this one here the UC rule that's just the Euclidean distance you tell you sum of all the squares routine she scores then you take the square root of that and the MTA rule is the more than average rule so um so essentially what I do here is I take the sum of of all the of all the TC scores that are above the mean and and ff4 that I divide it by the number of ligands above the mean so that's really to help you know like help wait you know like your your Lincoln profile like higher preferred for the four if you have more ligands that are chemically similar essentially and MTM rule is more the median so along the same lines of that and the previous rule right there and so the VAP rule is it's one of the more interesting roles here so what happens here is you rank all your TC scores that you calculated from your lien profile highest to lowest and and the whole point of this rule here is to try to find a gap like like like between between two you know like TC scores and how we calculate this is whether or not there's like if you ten times one of those times 1.5 and you try to find to see whether or not is greater or less than the one that's above it essentially right so let's start here so 0.8 and then we take point seven six times one point five so that's that's greater than this year so there's no gap right but if we take point seven six and then put four so point four times one point five year that's that's that's less than 0.76 right so so we consider that there's a gap there essentially and we take we take everything above that and we average it by the the number above the gap essentially right and and and otherwise we just use average okay and and for the ngx rule here it's it's very similar to the VAP rule described previously but instead of them and instead of the average here that if there's no gap here then we use the max rule okay and for the NGM rule more or less the same if there's no gap than we use you know the empty emeral or the median and last but not least just the empty a role here suppose so I started by the dryness of slides here but anyways with the so we have all 13 rules here that we use to score like each ligand in the database see how well it you know was able to find the true positives so the way that we evaluate how well this screen actually did here is by an enrichment testing so we do enrichment testing on the top 1% of the compound so we rank them all from as to lowest or lowest to highest depending on which rule that I used and I took the took that one top 1% there and see how many of the troop of the reference compounds I'll be able to get back essentially right so so it's calculated essentially the number of true positives here out of the total number of two positives right and then times 100 and so you get something between 0 and 100 0 being that you didn't find anything garbage and 100 being that you found pretty much everything right so the results are as follows so most of these rolls seem to do it's kind of all over the place really but but well one one big highlight here well okay let live let me explain with axes right here first so well okay so so for from actual that the whole point here is it's a positive control right so so so for the in the ligand profile the reference ligands are spiked as a ligand profile right and and for the and so this one spiked in for this one isn't it's not there the leggings are not alike in profile okay so we're relying completely on the related GPS years in terms of ligands okay so um what we found the back so here at 100% obviously for the match tool because the the ligands are their spectacle even profile so you're gonna pull them out but after taking those guys out here you still have you know you still have like this decreasing performance but it's not that much force the same kind of goes for the end fmz rule here and the NZXT rule which seems to perform pretty well all of all are somewhat close to 80 percent or at least so the performance remained relatively similar for most of these roles here which is sort of promising um so essentially that that's really but that that's really all I have for this for this part here and so a quick summary of the virtual screen here is that I was able to conduct the virtual screen here and not sure we call it a benchmark but it's based on Liggins from home on the CPC RS performance is not drastically reduced after after you know you take away all your your reference compounds in your Layton profile and the maximal seems to perform really the best so far so that's that's kind of it's kind of cool it's so it's so lasting here I'd like to end with some conclusions and final directions a glass database is so far we think it's the most comprehensive source of multiple data on gpcrs that means for for computer-aided drug design based on the bench the virtual screen benchmark that I had over there just now it suggests so far that the method could possibly be discovered apply it discovered double compounds but a lot more work needs to be done right here so some future directions here would it be really interesting to see how the the effects of the different scoring roles like a help like what kind of populations of the reference compounds that it captures right so next role may perform the best so far but other rules may may put like instead the national in pool essentially so it would be kind of cool to see like how how it sort of affects this so you know to look at the contributions of each scoring rule and also maybe try some different combinations to see if you know like whether or not it would affect performance right and another future direction here which I couldn't get in time for this year which wish I could but uh was incorporating coach so coaches a software that's developed in our lab that that's that's that's used for predicting binding sites and potential iggins that that your query protein may likely bind right and I I'm using this essentially to try to use a predictive method to incorporate principal against intimate leading profile to see if that increases performance whatsoever and it would be really cool to see this here because using some kind of a prediction predictive method to increase your you know your your your effectiveness if your virtual screen would be very useful I think so and most importantly here is as the using a larger data set so the current screen here it's done with the sink eights database which is also the data set they used was was sort of like processed that's how he uses from like a previous study that all the ligands were chemically diverse that they were it was like it was the corn quote and now redundant data set right but more importantly is if we use a larger data set from zinc 1222 million compounds drug light set to see if to see if we can get some very similar performance that way to increase you know like the breath if we can if if we get like you know like maybe 10 original factors and that pretty much means that that doesn't work so hoping I'm hoping creasing the scope of this here it's it's not only more practical because when you're screening for compounds you're gonna be have to screen like you know millions of compounds anyways so you might might as well try I might as well try that out and see if I can retain a performance hopefully and I think most most important build like the most applicable thing that this method can do here is for the D organization of gpcrs because there are roughly I would say maybe 150 or so GPCRs that are still classified as orphans Class A ones so they have no known function they have no no endogenous ligands so nothing's really known about these guys so this this could be a very useful method I believe for the for for try no you don't like it help fish out like what kind of link into my bind test to test out to see if if it may listen any functional to GPCRs if it finds or has any function you know it's just stuff like that help elucidate that so that would be very nice to see so like the end this talk with banking thank you all for listening to thank my boss Yankers patience and unwavering dedication as well as Brandon Jarrett Kevin so my lab and all the rest of my lab mates here which I couldn't fit on the page my dissertation committee and Beth and especially Jonathan also because he's thought Jonathan are close would be like you know big huge a huge mess essentially so anyways thank you all for listening and I'd love to answer any questions if you all have any how many do I usually use so the my current I can't cut off right now for for DPS for the last it's a one-time 10/10 801 hundreds currently I'm planning on changing that to cutting it back a little bit but it's you get anywhere from like like five to ten usually yeah that's the best trigger yeah I could just do like a normal plastic ass and last peso but it's just how many times to skin zinc it depends how how you sit like if I mean I go through every ligand so once the each time I go through the ligand I'm Kelly I'm capping all the similarities between every Lincoln in the profiles so you can think right as I'm going through once okay let's see for one GPS here are public takes around 5 hours or so five six hours yeah that's that's for 16,000 so there's the whole computational efficiency problem - well the problem with that is that I don't know which ones are GPS are related in the same database they're all unknown so that's why I want to screen them all this is this is the whole point of this screening because I don't know which one's GPS are related if I knew then I'll be able to choose it but I don't know right so you want me to cluster like like ligands I guess or something based on endless celerity so so this is going to be as possible I mean yeah money money free speed I'm sorry yeah that a clinical and chemical feature of the drug assigned by average old then there is maybe uh I mean I mean for uh I have to look into it I haven't even tried that before but it we can talk about after it's probably something uh but it would be it would probably speed up faster man in that way but yeah it's it's canard safe it might be it might be more bad generalized in that in that sense but if I could maybe do that look for targets first like maybe clusters and then and then screen those clusters just looking like that that could be ability no stupid questions her Nina which is a top and bottom like like like what I mean well the it okay so this is just a crystal structure but I mean you see a ligand bound here you look at it like and that's the X Tyler right there so if you have a ligand bound structure that's a very obvious it's gonna be right here if you have like a full length with I mean like they don't have any structures is like the n-terminal domain or anything but usually you know if you have like a large like a large internal domain you that's pretty obvious sometimes because a lot of these guys have large domains that they can crystallize you they can't have a lot of the crystallization process so but if you modeled domain and then this should be you know it's gonna be pretty obvious till it's usually not very large so so that's one we could tell yes but otherwise they have three loops on inside and outside so it's kinda hard the hard to see I mean if you see that if you look at that disulfide bond that's on the outside and on the inside so it's you know that way too yeah there are there are some that I've checked already so far because my cuz my cutoff for me values it's pretty stringent right now so it's kind of it's kind of limited in scope so I'm actually trying to tune my you value right now like like a little bit more flex I actually had a committee meeting Monday we talked about this problem one way I'm thinking right now is to produce my problem to the class a gpcrs and and and try to look at only Kamala G with the the transmembrane domains instead and there I can from there I could probably loosen my e-value cutoff to try to find you know like like like close but not like too far away homologs stuff like that yeah exactly yeah yeah I mean one thing I'm concerned about is like whether or not cuz like there's some would like these really really really large you know like interim and terminal like domains you know like that Asian everything so yeah true yeah I think the big the penis flytrap ones right the classy ones or something yeah yeah yeah those aren't that they they all usually have like pretty big ones so that might influence the the e-value of other things so I might look at the trans membranes but for only class days anyways yeah yeah sure you might because you've increased the length by two perhaps yeah I play around and see like you know how much effects yeah like for humans about 150 or so for humans according to our classification yeah that they're there they're mostly class a most of them which is not surprising because if they're the large group anyways
