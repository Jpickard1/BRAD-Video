First, the number of you who have opted to\nsubscribe to this channel has once again rolled over a power of 2, which is just mind-boggling\nto me. I\u2019m still touched that there\u2019s so many\nof you who enjoy math like this, just for fun, and who have helped support the channel\nby watching, by sharing the content here, and for many of you on Patreon, very directly\nsupporting it. Really, each one of the 2^19 of you means\na lot to me. As a thanks, and just for fun, I\u2019ll be doing\na second Q&A session. I\u2019ve left a link to where you can ask and\nupvote questions on the screen here and in the description, and just like with the first\none I\u2019ll answer the questions in the podcast I do with Ben Eater and Ben Stenhuag, since\nI think discussions are more fun than answers in a vacuum. By the way, if you guys don\u2019t already know\nabout Ben Eater\u2019s channel, what are ya\u2019 doing! This man is the Bob Ross of computer engineering. If you want to understand how a computer works,\nand I mean really understand it from the ground up, his channel is the place to go. "

        "text": "Trust me, he is a very good explainer. Anyway, the reason I bring him up is that\nhe and I just recorded a pretty interesting conversation about Net Neutrality. I want to be very clear: Ben Eater is not\nagainst net neutrality, and nor am I. However, the issue is a lot more nuanced than\nI first realized. And because there are already many great videos\nabout Net Neutrality, and why it\u2019s a good thing, to offer content you may not have seen\nbefore this conversation was a chance to unearth some of the tradeoffs at play here. You see, the thing about Eater is that before\nhe was creating educational content, he worked for many years in the networking industry,\nso he has a pretty clear view of both sides of this equation. I\u2019m going to play you just a minute of it\nhere, and then link to the full video if you want to go see it on Ben\u2019s channel, which\nyou should be going to check out anyway. For those of you who would prefer to listen\nto a 45-minute conversation in podcast form, we did also publish it as an episode  "
