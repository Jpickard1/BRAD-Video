thanks a lot Josh for that nice introduction and thanks everyone for coming um so my lab is largely interested in understanding the genetic ideology of brain disorders um with uh the focus of genomite Association studies or gwas and um gwas is the study of identifying variants and the overarching goal of my lab is to link these variants to uh specific function and again my lab is largely interested in uh brain disorders or psychiatric disorders so the overarching goal is to link variant to the brain function and we and others often think that the first step in linking variant to function is to identify the target genes of the variant um with the hypothesis that once we um identify the genes it's relatively easier for us to understand the biological Pathways uh cell types and circuits that are involved um with a given trait uh which could potentially provide us some mechanistic understanding and this is largely based on um uh the very uh um uh well depth studies on the gene function in terms of biological Pathways as well as um uh also Rich information about which cell types or which circuitry that these genes are highly expressed of so in the first part of my talk I'm mainly going to talk about how we would like to map variance to the Target genes using substance used as a use case and in the second part of my talk I will go to the very uh first part of the diagram to talk about our recent uh work on how we would like to Prior prioritize the variant from the very beginning using schizophrenia as a use case so with that let's focus on the first question and uh this really became the central um aspect of my lab uh largely thanks to my graduate student Nancy who has a picture here so um she's my first graduate student and when she came to my lab she told me that she's interested in addiction biology or genetic ideology of substance use and I was very puzzled when she told me that because my lab or I have never really worked on addiction at all before so um I asked her that um I'm not really working on that are you really sure that you would really like to do this and you would still like to join my lab and her answer was yes and she made a really great stride um since then and then she really made the substance Ed genetics as one part of the lab so um because of her I was also ATT track to this study um so that I can um uh study the genetic ideology of substance use and what was really uh surprising to me was that substance used phenotypes really give um a great platform to us um to study Gene environment interactions and um another uh important aspect of substance used genetics is that uh depending on which substances that you're using either alcohol or cigarettes you can actually get the different uh genetic makeup uh let me use my mouse because there are some people in the zoom too so um uh for example if you are measuring uh the genetic architecture of alcohol use it's actually not necessarily the same as the genetic architecture of the cigarette consumption and another very interesting aspect is that different behavior is encoded in the genome in a different manner so um what I mean by that is that for some of the substances like alcohol we all drink alcohol but it does not necessarily mean that we are all alcoholic and that's actually encoded in our genome so if you measure the genetic correlation between alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence um the genetic correlation is not perfect you you roughly get point six of genetic correlation between consumption and dependence measure however for some of the substances that are way more addictive like cigarettes consumption and dependence are actually encoding almost the same thing so that the genetic correlation between cigarette consumption and cigarette dependence or nicotin dependence is higher than point9 meaning that um cigar consumption can be a really good proxy in understanding the nicotine dependence so um to summarize almost the decadal study of what uh we have learned from um substance use genetics we now know that the genetic contribution to substance use is substantial and uh we have found out uh that out of many types of genetic variants common variations seem to play an important role and uh finally there's not a single genetic variant that can explain the whole substance used biology but um hundreds of genetic variants can be associated with substance use however this is not really the end of the story and actually opened another question and the major question here is that once we identify the variant how we can actually for the functional consequences of these variants and this is a very central question in the field largely because the majority of the variants that we identify from these Chas are coming from the non-coding region of the genome that we do not really know how to interpret very well and uh my lab uh has been actually built upon the three-dimensional chromatin structure and because of that uh we had a hypothesis that these risk variants that are associated with any trait can potentially affect the genes that are pretty distal away by forming this chromatin Loops um so that the risk variant may not really affect the nearby genes but can affect the genes that are disle if they are they are in um close physical proximity in the three-dimensional space so with that hypothesis um we have built what we call as heighty coupled magma or H magma and what H magma does is that it first groups the Snips into two groups the first group is exonic and promotor Snips and the second group is non-coding Snips and for those that are located in either exomes or motters we directly map them onto the target genes based on where they're located however still the majority of the Snips are unannotated and for those Snips we uh use high SE interactions or chromatin confirmation data sets to identify their target genes um based on these three dimensional landscape and after that we combine all this information together to generate what we call a snip to Gene level relationship Matrix and in this Matrix we can basically infer which Snips can be mapped to which genes so um the overarching concept of H magma is that once you identify the gene to snip level relationship Matrix you can go back to the jwa summary statistics which provides to you the snip level P values and then you can aggregate all these P values per snip into the gene level based on this relationship so all the P values for these five Snips can be mapped onto this blue genes and all of these three p values um from three Snips can be also mapped to this yellow Gene and vice versa and um using uh a tool uh that has been pre uh developed called magma that can actually aggregate the snip level P value to the gene level we can convert the snip level P value to the gene level P value so that we can now see which genes are significantly associated with a given trait so using this um schematic we try to leverage this um uh framework to four Jas that I mentioned earlier so four related to Cigar smoking one for cigar consumption and one for nicotin dependence and another two Jas for um alcohol use traits one for alcohol consumption and the other one is alcohol use disorder and then uh we try to basically generate the gene lists that are associated with um substance Ed phenotypes however there is still an open question which is largely from which highy data set um shall we actually infer this Gene to snip level relationship Matrix and this is largely because this relationship can be quite cell type and uh tissue specific so um we have to basically query this information from the relevant cell type or relevant tissue type so this led us to go back to the Circuit level mechanisms because circuit level mechanisms for addiction has been really relatively well understood so um uh from the circuit level studies we now know that um there are mainly two brain regions there are also of course other brain regions as well but two brain regions are very Central and those brain regions include midbrains that are largely contain dopaminergic neurons which project to the U prefrontal cortex which also contain different cell types that could potentially uh play a very critical role in developing addiction so we first wanted to see whether this circuit level mechanism could be translated back to the genetic level mechanism and for doing that we have run heritability enrichment analysis for um the enhancers that are either located in the midbrain or the prefrontal cortex and checked whether those enhancers are more likely to be enrich with genetic risk factors for four G traits that we have measured so um uh simply like uh long story short we have found that both enhancers in the prefrontal cortex as well as midbrain showed um High uh heritability enrichment for all four traits again showing that a circular level mechanism could be indeed translated back to the genetic level mechanism and because both of these brain regions contain various cell types we wanted to see which cell types seem to be most important so uh it's been really well known that within the midbrain dopaminergic neurons are Central so we wanted to see whether dopaminergic neuronal enhancers could potenti potentially provide um or explain the heritability enrichment that we have observed and indeed we found that uh dupic neuronal enhancers were enrich for all these four uh G traits um cortex gave a little more complicated signal because of the cellular heterogenity in the cortex um and out of four cell types that we measured we found that neurons seem to be the central player in understanding heritability enrichment although there seemed to be some gal roles as well so based on these um results we found we BAS basically determined that there will be two neuronal subtypes that are implicated for substance use disorders and those are midbrain dopaminergic neurons as well as cortical neurons um uh generated or obtained from the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex so using the highy data sets from these two highy data set we uh try to generate this Gene to snip level relationship Matrix so that we can infer the um uh Gene level P values were significantly Associated genes for each trait so um at the end of the day we were able to identify roughly hundreds of uh genes that were associated with individual trait however you will be able to acknowledge that nicotin dependence is an liar here that it only identify dozens of genes and this is not surprising because nicotin dependence was the least powered jws among four jws that we have identified and um uh because of that uh oftentimes in uh the work uh in the following work you will be able to see that nicotin dependence acts often as an outlier and we don't think that it's actually showing different biology but it could be largely coming from the low powered G so going back to the original diagram I told you earlier that once you identify the genes it's relatively easier for us to understand the biological pathway cell types or circuits that are involved with a disorder so I'm going to show you how identifying these genes from this data set um could potentially provide us some information about substance use biology so first we wanted to check which biological processes are associated with substance use and as a proof of principle concept and somewhat reassuringly we found some uh very clear evidence that we are finding something right so for example problematic alcohol use and drinks for week were not only uh associated with other terms but um the major term involved ethanol metabolic process as well as response to alcohol this is pretty much expected because we would expect that um ethanol metabolism is a key process when we are um measuring during genetic ideology of ethnol use similarly nicotine dependence and cigarettes per day are were associated with coleric nicotinic Pathways which um are again pretty much reassuring because we all know the cigarette is actually provoking those systems however we found other interesting Pathways involved in these for traits and those include Donal death or apoptotic Pathways that oh I lost my cursor now where is it oh sorry I still lost it sorry let me just use this um yeah so first of all I found that uh neuronal apoptosis was also Associated but it was not only neuronal apoptosis but um I found some neurodegenerative pathway so to protein binding was associated with drinks per week and Emily beta metabolism was Al Al was also associated with cigarettes per day and uh in addition to that I found that pain perception was associated with strings per week and sckers per day and that was also somewhat expected because we all know that opioid crisis has been actually provoked by uh pain prescription so we thought that addiction has to be associated with pain prescription and we also found that and finally we found a neuron alod dendrite cross talks and that this was pretty interesting because all of these Gene lists have been already queried from dopaminergic and cortical neurons so we thought that we would um see a lot of neuronal related Pathways but um even compared to the neuronal related Pathways we also found that all dendrites seem to play a role so this suggests that there might be some neurona cross talks that are involved with substance Ed genetic ideology secondly we wanted to see what kind of cell types are associated uh in explaining substance use risk and using cortical neuronal AG magma we wanted to see which cortical neurons are playing an important role in understanding substance use biology and here uh we found that oh again I can't find it sorry um I found that uh upper layer excitatory neurons seem to to play a role and in addition to that um these inhibitory neurons subtype 6 which stands for parvel human uh inhibitory neurons seem to be um shared among problematic alcohol used drinks per week and cigar per day and again you can see that nicotin dependence was an outlier and this is not really necessarily suggesting that nicotin dependence is really an inhibitory neuronal problem but I think it's largely because of the um low power G of nicotin dependence and in addition to that when it comes to dup minic neuronal H magma uh we found that it was not the uh fully mature dogic neurons that seemed to be most enriched with but uh we found that intermediate dopaminergic neurons across dopaminergic neuronal differentiation seem to express these genes most highly of um suggesting that dopaminergic neuronal development can potentially predispose an individual to be more susceptible to substance use we finally wanted to see whether um our genetic level mechanism can be now fed back to the circular level mechanism so uh in doing that we uh wanted to see whether the gene list that we have OB uh we have largely obtained from cortex and the midbrain can be actually used to infer other addiction related brain Pathways um uh that could uh give us some information about circuit level mechanism and uh interestingly we found that in addition to Cortex and the midbrain we found uh that amydala andalus were also showing High expression of these genes um again suggesting that even though we're not really getting the high SE data sets or Gene list from all different brain regions we could potentially still use the um genetic risk factors or the gene information from certain brain regions and can actually expand that to other brain regions to infer some circuit level mechanisms and then finally we wanted to see whether this level of information could be expanded to other types of substances and uh this is largely because uh we were only testing two substances here cigarettes and alcohol while there are so many different substances um that are affecting uh human health and in uh especially in the US opio use has been a really Central problem um however we do not really have a really well-powered gas when it comes to opioid um uh addiction so uh we thought that maybe we could leverage the genetic information that we have obtained from cigarette smoking alcohol use Behavior so that we can learn something about opioid or other types of substance uh use um until we get a better power us so um actually supporting this idea we found some extensive cross talks between substance used phenotypes so for example um problematic alcohol use was not only associated with ethanol metabolism but we found that um it was also Morphin and nicotinic response that seem to be involved and um similarly when it comes to nicotin dependence and sers per day again not only colonic and nicotinic Pathways were involved but um alkal catabolism was associated with nicotin dependence and cocaine response was associated with sckers per day so this suggested that there seems to be some genetic ideology shared across different substance used genetics so with that idea we wanted to see whether um we could identify the pathways that are shared between CER smoking and alcohol use behavior and whether that could infer some uh generalizable addiction mechanisms and um supporting this idea uh when we compare genetic correlation between uh problematic alal use in Secrets per day while the genetic correlation was not super high we found some meaningful genetic correlation so because of this um uh we gener uh we performed rank Frank hyper geometric overlap or rho and what it does is that it ranks the gene list for problematic alcohol use based on the H magma output and also rank the gene list for sickers per day based on H magma output so that any genes with uh uh significant P values will be ranked more top and then you could actually infer the genes that are shared in both of these lists and uh by running this we were able to find um some difference between duic neurons and cortical neurons for the first time and what we have observed from here was that compared to cortical neuronal H magma that we identified only 120 genes Dam inuring neuronal H magma seem to identify roughly 3,000 genes to be shared between cigarettes per day and problematic alcohol use um which potentially suggest that there might be some circus specific mechanism in understanding plot tropy and uh potentially that pleotropic mechanism can largely arise from midbrain dopaminergic neurons than um cortical neurons so we named these Gene sets that have been um shared between problematic alcohol use and cerss per day as pleotropic genes and we wanted to know what those genes were doing um so first we wanted to see what kind of biological Pathways were involved with plot genes and we found that they were largely neuronal or synaptic involved which is not surprising at all because we found actually these Gene list based on the neuronal highy data sets however when we um check this uh check their cellular expression levels within the midbrain we found that it was not only dopaminergic neurons that showed High expression of these genes but we also found that midbrain G ggic neurons and serotonergic neurons were also involved uh suggesting that it is not only just one cell type within the midbrain but multiple neuronal subtypes within the mid brain can all collegially affect the pleotropic mechanism and in addition to that um again AC uh across dopaminergic neuronal differentiation we found that da1 or the intermediate dopaminergic neurons seem to be uh Central for understanding plot tropy we finally wanted to see whether these pleotropic genes indeed play some important roles when it comes to other types of substances that we haven't even tested and in this case we used cocaine Caine uh treatment so um uh in this study they have uh dissected nucleus accumbent from the cocaine treated mice and then perform single cell RNA sequencing and out of many different cell types within the nucleus accumbent they found uh the largest differential expression signal that has been elicited by cocaine in these uh cell types that are involving dopaminergic receptor expressing medial spining neurons so we compared our pleotropic genes with cocaine elicited deegs and found some uh found that there were significant overlap and in addition to that even though these genes were not significantly always differentially uh regulated when we compare the gene expression of all these 3,000 genes we found that they were pretty much um uh consistently downregulated upon treatment of cocaine so suggesting that even if we um generated this Gene list from two totally different types of substances maybe the mechanism that we identify from these Gene list could potentially inform us um uh uh when it comes to the mechanism of other types of substance of abuse so to summarize the first part of my talk I hope that I convinced you today that we can potentially use H magma to map variance to the Target genes and by mapping uh G was for substance use um we were able to identify biological pathway cell types and circuits that are involved with substance use biology so with that uh I am going to the next part of my talk which is how we would like to PR prioritize the variant and the reason behind this is because we finally came to the point where we have too many variants too many genes problem so for example um when we apply H magma to schizophrenia J that has been published in 2018 we identify 5,000 genes to be implicated in schizophrenia and even if I generated this Gene list I don't really believe that all of those genes will be causally implicated in schizophrenia so um there's one way to actually prune down these Gene list and that's um by just focusing on genome y significant Loi so H magma basically leverages genomewide um snip level information so it still converts the snip level P values when it's under uh when it's underneath this genomite significant threshold however uh by just um focusing on genomite significant Loi you're only looking at these Loi that pass the genome my significant threshold and um from these Lowa you can actually um even further narrow down the variance by performing computational fine mapping algorithm that gives you the what we call this credible snip list that gives you basically the smallest set of snips that are um uh that can explain uh individual Locus and by leveraging multiple Gene mapping algorithms we can actually map these variance to roughly 1100 genes and even if this is one fif of the original Gene list we still think that this is too many so we were wondering whether there is a way that we can even further prioritize the variance coming from these u f map schizophrenia variants so for doing that we have performed massively parallel reporter essay or I will call it impr from here and uh this has been largely spearheaded by two very talented graduate students Jessica and soul so here what we have done was that we put schizophrenia risk variants um so all those 6,000 schizophrenia risk variants that mentioned earlier an individual variant is going to have two Al so we were roughly testing um uh 12,000 Al here in the same essay and uh we put them in front of the promoter and the gfp which is a reporter Gene followed by the 20 nucleotide bar codes and then we packaged this into the aav which was then transduced to human neuroprogenitor cells and within human neuroprogenitor cells what we would expect is that risk alal and protective alal for a given variant is going to affect the gene expression of the gfp and this expression elicited by these um genetic variants can be measured by performing RNA sequencing on the barcode and we already know which barcodes are pre-mapped to the variant so just by quantifying the barcode expression level we can infer which variance or which Al can it be actually mapped back to um so here the major hypothesis is that if a given variant has different barcode expression level between risk and protective alals um we can call them as regulatory variants or ositive variants and we would like to distinguish these empop positive variants from emperra negative variants that do not show such alic regulatory activity and um here I'm not calling this as regulatory or non-regulatory variants because I don't really expect that all empan negative variants are going to be truly non-regulatory because some of them can affect alternative splicing or other types of gene regulatory mechanisms that we are not really testing here so with that uh we implemented EMA on uh 6,000 variants that I mentioned earlier and out of those 6,000 variants some of the variants uh were not really testable using empa uh largely because they overlap with the molecular cloning strategies that we are using as well as some of the variants were actually missed by barcode dispersion during the cloning process so at the end of the day we were able to test the regulatory activity of uh 51,000 variants and out of these 51,000 variants only roughly 400 variant showed regulatory activity if you see the volcano plot of these variant function you can uh acknowledge that we are not only identifying the significant variants but we can also find the directionality of the effects of these variants meaning that we now know whether the risk alal that is basically increasing the risk for developing schizophrenia is increasing their gene expression or decreasing their gene expression and on top of that we're not we're not only narrowing down the variant list from just 5,000 to 400 but we can actually dramatically reduce the number of snips per Locus meaning that even after performing fine map um still a huge chunk of Phi could be explained by more than 50 variants but by performing empera we can uh usually explain a given Locus by less than five variants and this is giving a perfect example of how Emperor can greatly narrow down the snipet so this gas Locus as you can see has a pretty complex signal and it's located in 1C Gene and um out of these complex genetic signal that is elicited by LD you can um actually narrow down this region into uh roughly a little more than dozen uh Snips uh using fine mapping algorithm however once you perform empa you can still narrow down this like a little more than dozen Snips into single variant that has the OIC regulatory activity so this case it gives you a perfect example of how empera can greatly refine the snip and uh once we ma this snip into uh using three-dimensional chromatin structure we found that this snip was actually interacting with one of the promoters of cap1 C so since we now have the emra positive variance that we can follow up we wanted to see whether we could use this data set to basically train and infer what is the fundamental uh regulatory logic of the variance that we identified and in other words we basically wanted to find what are the distinguishing factors for ositive snips and the major hypothesis behind this is that if we actually really identify the regulatory logic um to predict empop positive Snips we can potentially use this information and expand it to other GS that we haven't really tested experimentally and then um we can just uh infer which variant are causal or which variants are regulatory versus not just based on the emra data set that we got so we have compiled multiple hypothesis on what makes a causal variance and we tested whether those hypothesis actually can distinguish empera positive variance from negative variance so first we wanted to see whether the variance with strongest Association statistics coming from gas are likely causal secondly we tested whether variant with higher posterior probability from theine mapping algorithms are likely causal thirdly we wanted to see whether evolutionary conservation matters in a sense that evolutionary conserved variants are more likely causal and finally I think this is the most prevailing hypothesis in the field that variance within enhancers or variance within chromatin accessibility or variance that um change the transcription Factor motifs can potentially uh play a causal role so we wanted to test an individual hypothesis so first we wanted to check whether G summary statistics differ between infra positive and negative variants and the simple answer was no when we compared um GSP value or GS Al ratio we cannot really find some uh clear distinguishment between emra positive and negative variance and um in addition to that out of 102 Loi that we identified EMP Positive Hits only 12 flai contained EMP positive variant that also showed regulatory activity so this means that if you're just following up on index Snips which basically means um the Snips with strongest Association at a given Locus you will um probably be wrong um in U more than 90% of the cases secondly we wanted to see whether fine map posterior probability differs between EMP positive and negative variance and again simple answer was no that fine mapping uh algorithm can potentially narrow down the snip list but posterior probability itself does not provide any meaningful information about regulatory information and um in addition to that there was also no difference in evolutionary conservation between um Ember positive and negative variance and this was calculated um uh and invert recently from zunia Consortium by comparing roughly 240 Maman species genome we finally checked whether um functional annotation can potentially um uh explain uh the difference between empa positive and negative variance and the very simple answer was no enhancer overlap alone did not really seem to distinguish empa positive varians from negative variant however there seem to be some cell type specific effects so for example emra positive Snips seem to be more located in neuronal enhancers compared to the rest of the gal enhancers and on top of that we found that early excitor neuronal enhancers seem to have a higher overlap with emra positive variant compared to the emra negative variants and we found the same thing from uh enhancers from asites and elender sites in the fetal brain however in general enhancer overlap alone did not really seem to really distinguish emra positive from embra negative Varian this was very very puzzling to us because it is really well known that schizophrenia is a neuronal disorder and people have found over and over that GEOS of schizophrenia is associated or enriched in neuronal or brain enhancers but we're not really finding this so we wanted to see whether um these empop positive variants are potentially more enriched compared to the background so we um uh leveraged two genomic backgrounds the first one is the LD Snips so those are local backgrounds that means that we basically identified all the Snips within the LD um in of of this genomite significant loow thigh and then try to just identify the Snips within those loow thigh that are not associated with schizophrenia and then we also generated the random background snip sets so these Snips are spread across the genome so they are not located in schizophrenia genomic significant lowy however they are matched um uh with empop positive variants uh when it comes to minor alal frequency as well as the um LD structures so um even when compared to LD to empop positive Snips we did not really see very significant enrichment of empop positive Snips Within These enhancers however we started finding very significant enrichment for empop positive Snips when we compare them to the random backgrounds so according to this um study what we are thinking is that these genom my significant lowai are already showing elevated signal to neuronal enhancers or brain enhancers and because they already put these lowai into the elevated enrichment it is very dis uh difficult to parse out the function within those low side just based on the enhancer overlap so that was our take away from this and finally we wanted to see whether transcription Factor binding occupancy can potentially um uh uh parse out the Ember positive variance from negative variance and when doing this we did a little more complicated stuff than just the uh position weighted Matrix data set so we tried to infer the transcription Factor activity rather than just transcription Factor binding by combining transcription Factor binding with expression and transcription Factor function and when it comes to transcription Factor binding we did not only identify the position weighted Matrix but uh when we are measuring whether the risk alal can disrupt or increase transcription Factor binding we have leveraged this data sets that have been generated from Bing Ren slab that has actually experimentally tested The Binding occupancy of the transcription factor and compared the transcription Factor binding occupancy between risk and protective oals and they did it for roughly 400 transcription Factor uh transcription factors and out of 400 transcription factors that they experimentally tested they were able to generate this support Vector machine only from roughly 90 transcription factors so it means that they could predict the transcription Factor binding activity based on the uh training data set that they have experimentally validated and we only use those rather than using position weighted Matrix because whatever you do with position weighted Matrix we never really found any relationship and I think it's largely because um it is very noisy and because of this transcription Factor binding occupancy is cell type agnostic we try to incorporate cell type information by uh incorporating how much of these transcription factors are expressed in the cell types that we introduced these variants so um hmps or human neuroprogenitor cells and on top of that transcription factor is not always an activator but it can also act as a repressor so when the transcri factor is a repressor if the risk oal disrupts its binding it means that the gene expression should be actually increased rather than decreased so we also try to leverage that information so once we actually taken into multiple um aspects of transcription Factor activity we started getting some difference between Ember positive and negative variance so that you can see that empera log fold change um had some weak correlation with um transcription Factor um activity that we um predicted and uh that relationship was totally abolished when we compare that with emperra negative variance and we wish that this relationship will grow once we have a better understanding of transcription Factor so if we can actually get this transcription Factor binding occupancy for not only 94 transcription factors but um to 2,000 transcription factors that exist in the human genome um as well as if we know whether transission factors are actually acting as a repressor or activator in human neuroprogenitors because many of them can actually act both I think this uh relationship will definitely grow so going back to the very Original Part um I have shown you earlier that we were largely using um High SE data sets to map variance to the Target genes however actually in the field the gold um standard principle in mapping variance to the Target Gene is to utilize expression quantitative trait lowai or eqtl so we wanted to compare our emper results with eqtls to see how many of these emperra positive variants can be mapped back to the eqtl data sets and out of 9% of the variants that we found regulatory activity uh we found only 36% of those variants uh were overlapping with brain eqtls while 64% of them did not show any eqtl evidence and out of those uh that overlap with eqtl um reassuringly we found that um more than 80% of the variant showed identical direction of the effects with eqtl um showing that empa and eqtl are both suggesting um the same direction of the effects when it comes to the gene expression and um out of those eqtls that showed uh identical direction of the effects again more than 80 of uh percent of those variants were also showing calization signals with g um suggesting that these eqtl and GS overlap is not just furious Association coming from LD so um even though these parts were somewhat reassuring we were pretty much um puzzled by this graph showing that a lot of these emper positive variants do not show eqtl evidence and this um uh let us go back to a recent preprint coming from Jonathan Pritcher lab that has shown that GE hits and eqtls are identifying actually different set of variants and in this study they have shown that gats um are more likely to affect or identify the variants that are distal to transcription start sites and therefore they are more regulatory or uh distal enhancers like compared to the eqtl identified variants so with this we wanted to see whether our ositive variance that show no eql evidence so this sets versus empa positive variants that do overlap with eqtl and also show identical direction of the effect so these variants and wanted to compare whether those two sets of variants are indeed different um so when we first compare the transcription star side distance between emra positive variants that are over non-overlapping with eqtls and overlapping with eqtls we indeed found that embra positive variants that are non overlapping with eqtls were more distal to transcription star sites and um supporting that we found that those variants that are not overlapping with eqtls were more likely to be located in distal neuronal enhancers compared to the empop positive variant that we're overlapping with eqs so this um uh made us go back to the original idea of how to map variant to the Target genes um that maybe given that a lot of these ositive variants are located in the regul uh distal regulatory elements that are not necessarily overlapping with eqtls we can potentially leverage High SE uh driven information in linking variant to Target genes so um to do that we have um leveraged the um uh long range chromatin interaction data sets across human neuronal differentiation so um uh highy data sets obtained from germinal Zone and cortical plates coming from the U fetal brain as well as pediatric neurons and adult neurons and then we compiled all the long range interactome across these human neuronal differentiation so that we can map Andra positive Snips to their target gen and when we did that again very surprising ly eqtl and highy seem to identify largely non-overlapping set of genes and we then wanted to go back to Jonathan PR uh preprint to see whether um these gas hits um are indeed identifying different genes not only different set of variants but also different sets of genes compared to the eqtls so in their studies they have shown that Jos hits are more likely to affect the genes with um higher selective constraints so if those genes are mutated humans are more likely to be lethal and um also genes that have higher regulatory complexity so those genes are more likely to have multiple enhancers and more complex enhancers and finally they have shown that GS hits are more likely to affect genes with functional annotations so we wanted to test individual hypothesis so when we compared The Selective constraints between eqt guided genes and high SE guided genes we found that high SE guided genes had lower L scores compared to the EQ guided genes and this um uh if a given Gene has lower love score it means that that Gene um has um uh basically more um is more susceptible or sensitive to any uh Gene dosage effects so if that um Gene has any mutations people are more likely to become lethal so this suggests that uh indeed highy guided genes seem to have higher selective constraints and secondly we wanted to see how many Loops were anchored to EQ tail guided genes versus high guided genes and again we found that highy guided genes had higher number of Loops compared to eqt guided genes and finally when we compare the geneontology between High guided genes and eal guided genes I know that the font is very small but I think you will be able to acknowledge that there were way more geontologies that uh were uh involved with high SE um uh base mapping compared to the eqtl base mapping so this really suggests that when it comes to uh identifying uh variant to Gene relationship uh from EMP positive variants we can potentially utilize High SE data sets than the eqtl data sets so um in mapping uh or integrating these two types of data sets together um we were wondering whether we could utilize another third sets of data and that was largely because EMA is all conducted in an episomal manner which means that all of these plasmids or libraries are introduced into the cells without any chromatin so these plasmids are just there in a nent format so we can actually test the potential variant effects when there's a no chromatin at all but um still it means that we're not really testing the variant effects under the chromatin or endogenous context so we thought that maybe we can borrow that endogenous context from a taxic data set so that while chromatin uh while a taxic can provide us the endogenous chromatin context from the chromatin accessibility data we can uh potentially use the high SE to infer these variant impacts onto the target genes so for that purpose we have uh proposed uh an accessibility by contact model and this is actually building up on um Jesse init's um activity by contact model but he was basically using that to infer enhancer Gene relationship and here we would like to use this to infer the variant level activity onto the gene level so for a given Locus what we are trying to do is when we're um not we can have the AL activity that is measured by uh empa lock fold change and then we can leverage um the chromatin context as well as the chromatin contct frequency so that it we can infer um its impact on the gene expression so we simply um weighted the emra measured alic activity with chromatin accessibility in which these uh variant is located in and we also counted the chromatin contact between this variant and the target Gene that we would like to test and then after that we summed up all those expression within a given Locus so that we can predict the gene expression so if um we say that Target Gene is predicted to be upregulated in a disease condition we can actually then compare this against schizophrenic postmortem brain expression data set to see whether those genes are indeed upregulated in schizophrenia postmodern brain expression so we first wanted to see how this model acts when we are only counting embra level activity so only if we are testing alic regulatory activity what is the predictive power and we found that when we were just summing up the alic activity that was measured by empa roughly 55% of the genes seem to have consistent direction of the effects um with postmortem expression data when we are putting um chromatin contact information on to on top of that we found that uh the predictability grew a little bit that we now have roughly 57% of the genes with consistent direction of the effects and finally when we um were including chromatin accessibility on top of that we found that more than 60% of the gene showed consistent direction of the effect with schizophrenia postmodern brain expression and this was also very statistically significant compared to the permuted uh distribution so with that uh to summarize the second part of my talk uh I hope that I convinced you today that Emperor can provide a great Avenue to study uh the variant effects and uh we can prioritize the variance from G using uh this high throughput screening system and uh often times the biological principles that we are actually G Gathering From empa or exper experimental validation can be distinct from the pre-existing hypothesis and also in mapping these variants to the Target genes potentially chromatin architecture um including High SE and a taxi can provide um some complimentary system to link variants to the Target genes and also can complement the episomal nature of embra so because we are very much intrigued by um the results that we obtained from schizophrenia risk variants um I know that Alan and Josh are also within this Consortium but we are trying to basically expand this um approach to roughly 250,000 variants associated with various human diseases and we are going to introduce this to M circulation so that we can test the variant effects in multiple organs and because many of these disorders and variants have sex specific effects we would like to test the variant effects in two different Sexes of the mice and finally we're going to introduce half of these mice with immune stimulation so that we can see how these variants are um affected based on the immune stimulation or some level of Gene environment interactions so with that I would like to give a special shout out to especially these three trainees ncy who really spearheaded the first work and Jessica and Su who really spearheaded the second part of the work and all of my collaborators um AC across UNCC M RTI and UCLA and thank you for your attention yes oh oh thank you for the great talk um so I was really surprised by like um H magma and ekl ident like identifying different variants um but then with h magma assigning uh variants and promoters and exons to their closest Gene do you think that you might be missing some um like do you think that they might actually be acting as enhancers distal to other genes instead um I think h magma will likely going to pin that interactions right any distal relationships will be qu H mag oh sorry a variant in promoters oh in promoters yeah but H magma actually um assigns promoter variant to that Gene too so we hope that those proximal interactions May largely also be retained because all the promoter variants are assigned to that Gene is that what you're asking oh yeah no I guess because uh yeah you know there there's some promoters that have some like that show enhancer like Behavior like very small percentage right but you know so yeah you can actually test that too um so in our study we did not really do that so we did not really map promoter variants to distal genes largely because we think those variants were are more likely to affect um that Gene rather than the distal genes but you're totally right that when you are measuring the promoter anchored interaction roughly 20% of them are connected to different promoters uh what we are thinking is that highy resolution is actually 10 kilobase um and our promoter definition here is 2 kilobase right so um if the variant is indeed in close LD there will be some um uh variants that are very close to promoters but are not really assigned as that promoter and those variants should be still mapped to the other promoter so we hope that it's not really going to miss too much information yeah that makes a lot of sense thank you uh great talk um I have another question about H magma so um we we've explored you know contact connecting regulatory elements to genes a lot and it's still very unsolved I think um H how do you how does could you go a little bit into more detail how H magma works are you're assigning to all variants a regulatory element to a gene within a tad or are you expecting that to be a loop between the regulatory element and and the oh yeah we're only using Loops here okay so we're not really counting the Tad because as uh sorry I still don't know where my cursor is um but yeah when it comes to H magma we only uses uh we only use the um Loop information to link variants to the genes so first of all if um we filter out any variants that are located in either Exon or promoters and promoters are just defined as 0 to 2 KB Upstream of the uh promoter definition or transcription star sites and then uh for the variants that are mapped to those we just assign them to those genes so exonic variants or promoter variants are assigned to those genes is still um means that 98% of the variants or 95 to 98% of the variants are going to be non-annotated because they're in the non-coding region of the genome and only for those variants we are testing how how often they are um uh interacting or in the loop U with any other promoters of the gene so we're only using promoter anchor Loops here rather than just all loops and then um if those variants are can be anchored back to the promoters using High SE data sets then uh we call that those Snips can be mapped to those gen does that make sense and we just collapse all that information at the end of the day and what fraction of variance can you do that with oh the original paper actually has all the snip uh counts but um I think it was very similar to the number of when you when you're just counting the number of snips it was very similar to the number of snips that magma can call when you're using like really large window so it is not uh annotating every single variant within the genome but uh it was still annotating a huge chunk okay yeah thank you I have a question um I was really interested in the observation about the differences between the eqtl versus gws Snips what do you think is behind that is it just a you know sensitivity problem with gene expression analysis um so what they have suggested was um evolutionary selective pressure effects so um G1 is actually um balancing the cases and controls right so those cases in the general population um are going to be very minimal right but they are actually putting those into almost 50% when it comes to GS associations so it means that gwas can actually um uh bias or make it more disproportionate when it comes to variants that are undergoing selective pressure however eqtls are usually coming from the general population and usually they're trying to generate that from healthy individuals and because of that the majority of the variants that are associated with expression should not undergo any selective pressure so um any variants that do not really affect any important genes are going to be first identified of course if you expand the search space and ex um if you just increase that to millions and millions of people um at the end of the day you will be able to identify the variant Gene relationship sh for almost everything but at the current power we are basically selectively more identifying the variants that are not really important for human health or disease I think that was their interpretation and um David gin's group has also shown the same thing before that um uh disease Associated genes where dosage sensitive genes are more likely um to have really complex regulatory relationships and it's because if one of the enhancers are not out that Gene can have very dilus effect of the human health so those are selected out so really important health related genes are more likely to have multiple enhancers to buffer out their gene expression and therefore those variants are also going to be buffered out when it comes to eqtl study design does that make sense yeah um another question it was kind of striking to me that you found about five Snips from the empera at at each uh Locus so were those Snips in close proximity to each other like would you consider them to be in the same regulatory element or maybe disrupting the same transcription Factor that's actually a great idea we haven't tested that at all um I think I definitely need to test that out um the major reason that we actually generated this was because indeed even after performing empa the majority of the loai I think only 19 loai could be summarized into a single variant and it's still the majority of the lowai were still multivariant so we have to uh come up with a plan to summarize all this right um so that whether how much of the plot tropy exists when it comes to multivariant loai but I haven't really tested that question per se whether those variants are acting in the same regulatory element or logic I think that's an excellent question we can definitely ask that any other questions um any questions on Zoom you can't see anything I don't any okay all right then we'll wrap up thanks he Jung for a great talk thank you everyone
