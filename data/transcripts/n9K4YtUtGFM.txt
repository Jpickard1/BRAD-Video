Arsen sis like many of you all probably already know him he's been collaborating with several folks in the department and he's here at michigan is a research investigator on the faculty with the Michigan Center for translational pathology where he works with the rule and the team over there and he's in he's a becoming a leader very quickly in a very important area that bridges therapeutic discovery all the way out to treatment and depends on bioinformatics analysis including novel methods apply to immunological components to help us understand the very important area of cancer immunotherapy ticks you know therapy both at the genotype level phenotype and even into outcome so it's really an impressive array of capabilities that Marcin brings forward to us he is a I think in your heart of hearts you're not only a computational biologist but a biophysicist which since I was trained as a biophysicist at all always makes me happy he likes crystallography things like that he also is a biotechnologists got a master's degree in biotechnology and crack up in his native Poland and and got his PhD in structural biology biophysics computational biology at the University of Virginia Charlottesville one of the most beautiful campuses in the planet he's been with us since 2013 he's already a PI on two important venues in the prostate cancer area mijeong investigator award in prostate cancer with the prostate cancer foundation and he's also has a three year award out to 2020 with the DoD pcrp program looking at regulatory networks of immune evasion and metastatic prostate cancer you know I could go on but I think it would be better let him go on because we're really in for a treat the research is cutting-edge he already has you know nearly 20 first off the papers and another bunch of collaborative papers and you know he's really making a mark for himself at this early stage in your career he is a faculty recruit here in DC MB we're proud to say that and what we welcome you to DC MB into our seminar series and we're excited to hear about your site Ward thank you very much so thank you very much for having me I had a very nice time thank you for the students for meeting with me thank you for the faculty herd taking their time to looking over the next two days so what I'll talk to you today is a little bit different from what Brian introduced me with I now so I'm I'm interviewing simultaneously at the pathology department and the biometrics Department and when I was presenting talked to the pathology department I thought it was very important to route my buying chromatics research clinically to the applications and the needs of oncologists of technologists of medical school since I'm presenting here to buy informatics department I decided to start on my talk a little bit differently I will talk more about the algorithmic and bang dramatic strengths that I come with and how they can be applied to study cancer and also how they can be translated so I'll talk to you about their position effectors and organizing principle for studying somatic aberrations in cancer and really the idea for this for this research and for this topic came about three years ago when when I was like thinking I was at that point studying structural rearrangements in cancer using rna-seq data and I had this idea and I was thinking so when a structural variant what does happen to the chromatin that was at the point of the breakpoint does it change doesn't it change then I asked the senior member of our lab Dan Robinson whether he knew anything about this since he's a go-to person for this type of knowledge and he says I don't know but you should read about the position effect that's how I learned about the position effect and that's how all the frame our future discoveries in that so to motivate my my research I like to show you how a cancer looks like in terms of its genomic organization so a primary prostate cancer looks typically like that the black line represents the to copy state of the genome and as you can see that genome is largely diploid there are a number of small copy number aberrations most of them are very recurrent like for example the gain of the 8q arm and the Q arm of chromosome 8 or the loss of of the HP arm on the eighth chromosome for example the loss on 16 Q is also very prominent but overall there are very few large-scale changes hundreds of breakpoints sometimes on weekends on the other hand a metastatic cancer looks like that it's just haywire everything is rearranged that cancer is based on triploid we have LOH single copy up to five copy whole chromosome arms lots of structural variants AMS and what I find quite remarkable is is that we don't really understand what the functional consequences are of this and how they are selected and how these rearrangements really contributes to the mission of the cancer to survive and take over so obviously all those copy number changes are also reflected in structural variants we can use various techniques to discover structural variants one of them is gene pollutant as you can see prostate cancer is among the most rearranged cancers based on the number of units per sample across all the other metastatic tumors which is surprising because primary prostate cancer is among the least rearranged cancers so just to introduce you to the position effect and here I'm really really just introducing the concert was discovered in 1930 it was discovered in drosophila where it was noted that ionizing radiation causes inversion on the on the drosophila chromosomes which can rearrange gene here the gene is called white and when the white gene gets inverted into a different locus it stops making the pigment so we have a very pattern pattern coloring of the of the Drosophila I in molecular terms the white gene gets inserted into heterochromatin and then as a result of chromatin domain spreading the gene gets silenced but what I'd like to emphasize is that this process is quite random in some certain cells that gene will be silenced and certain cells it won't and sometimes a cell that got the gene silent will grow meaning the silencing happened early so we have those patterns of big blobs where the gene did or didn't get get silenced which points to the inheritance the epigenetic inheritance of those changes the position effect occurs also in animals so here's an example of the steel locust and and in Mouse and the normal Mouse looks like that this is a mouse with inversion this is a mouse with inversion which puts the gene even farther from the enhancer the gene is regulated by and this is a mouse which has a mutation in the gene itself so as you can see as you can see the position effect can have sometimes effect just as a knockout at sometimes it's an intermediate effect between the wild-type of course there are many genetic diseases which are associated with position effects and there are often discussed as such the longer the list is quite long I would like to focus here on two of them and the hugs D local 3 arrangements and also the most frequent translocation that doesn't involve the whole chromosome arm and human and this this translocation is phenotypically you know typically silent but creates a huge risk for the Emmanuel's syndrome due to miss segregation of the rearranged translocated chroma so just to show you the honda locus it's probably the one of the greatest discoveries I at least have read about so there are diseases associated with the rearrangement in the Hawks locus so here are three patients all of them have a translocation or an inversion that breaks the hugs D locus and in half and the phenotype of all of the patients although slightly variable looks somewhat like this the arm forms but the fingers of the patients do not form if we look much later about the molecular biology that was done to study the HMDA locus and here really beautiful work from Google's lab where they showed that the hugs B locus is regulated by two different sets of enhancers these enhancers regulate the locus in the forearm or the arm and these enhancers regulate the expression of the hugs D genes in the digits and obviously if the translocation separates hugs B from from its enhancers then the digits will not form there's also an underlying spreading of silencing marks on the chromatin that that is that really causes this enhancer Association switch between the house delorca's the other example I wanted to give you is that the transportation between chromosome 11 and chromosome 12 and here the translocation is phenotypically silent but a very nice study kind of ignored by the scientific community showed that and that although what they did they created cell lines out of patients who had had the translocation and they looked for gene expression difference between the rearranged and non rearranged cell lines and what they found is that the majority of genes that are differentially expressed between those two sets of cell lines with two sets of patients are actually on the chromosome arm of the rearranged derivative the derivative chromosome 22 to this is absolutely remarkable which means that this translocation which puts one piece of chromosome on to another chromosome has such wide-ranging consequences though the position effect actually extends way way way from from the actual grade points actually dis regulating the whole with a whole chromosome so I would like to discuss position effects in the context of a metastatic prostate cancer just to give you a very broad oval overview metastatic cancer has many recurrent copy number changes what I show here are either recurrent copy gains or recurrent copy losses and as you can see there are a number of genes which are associated recurrent gains and recurrent losses but also metastatic prostate cancer is associated with many different and with many different mutations among them the most frequent ones are mutations in fox awhonn but also are mutations in NC d k12 and I'll discuss how position affect hope how position effects are related to mutations in Fox I want and also mutations in C D k12 so just to show you mutations city k12 is recurrently mutated at about 7% all of the mutations are in activating so they inactivate both alleles of cdk 12 as a result the tumor becomes cdk 12 no and the frequency of those limitations is not higher in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer then in primary prostate cancer but there's one intriguing finding the city k12 gene is absolutely essential so the lat the loss of cdk 12 is incompatible with life here and this has been reproduced by many labs including ours but here's had published and CRISPR knockout screen which shows that cdk 12 is among the most essential genes in the human genome so of course there is a question how is it possible that the tumor loses both copies of cdk 12 but still manages to survive the city k12 lost results in a very dramatic copy-number phenotype so here you can see the copy number plot or a select decay twelve case and as you can see it's baseline diploid with very few copy losses here highlighted in blue but a large number of focal tandem duplications like this here highlighted by those different spikes we can look at this at the ploidy plot and you can see that compared to other types of genomic aberrations such as homologous recombination deficiency or mismatch repair deficiency syndicate wealth mutant tumors our habit Floy d between two and three but really that the this this means that they are based on in diploid plus twenty percent of the genome is in those focal gains and the number of those focal gains at least estimated from whole exome sequences is about two hundred to three hundred servers there's quite a lot of those rearrangements right now we don't know whether they form all at once or whether they are progressively acquired by the tumor where's the protein these yeah yeah so these are detail baseline triploid cases so they have a baseline triploid genome and on top of this baseline reploid genome they have additional copy number changes so then we looked at at this from the perspective of whole genome sequences here I'm showing you chromosome eight in this top table bar you can see here the different copy number states so this is one copy this is two copies and as you can see in this particular case we have this characteristic imbalance between prostate cancer between and are actually stable this HP loss and 82 games of the 8q is baseline triploid the ATP was baseline diploid but lost lost also one copy and you can see those those those gains the dotted lines represent structural variants and you can see the structural variants are at the book end of the of the copy gains which allows us to determine the indeed tandem duplications if we look at the size distributions of those focal gains here cdk 1200 our whole genome sequences for syndicate 12 cases are pulled and as you can see the size distribution has is bimodal it has a peak at around 300 KB and another peak at slightly over 2 mega bases if we contrast that to aberrations or tandem duplication scene and other types of tumors such as homologous recombination deficiency you it doesn't really line up however the size distribution is quite similar to the size of replication domains at least the one which which are called and in prostate prostate cell lines here the second peak is not very prominent but the first peak which is the most frequent size of replication domain matches up almost exactly with cdk 12 we don't know yet much about the mechanism that underlies the there are structural rearrangements how it is stitched together but some analysis of the breakpoints suggests that there are many inserted bases at the breakpoint so there's some non templated how possibly non templated insertion or templated from a remote region and this suggests a particular stitching together mechanism but this remains to be the details of that remain to be determined so to just put you this in perspective we have right now a number of classes of genes that determine genomic instability there is homologous recombination deficiency which is caused by mutations in bracha called b2r ATM which leads to phenotype which we refer to Bracken s it has a very strong number of characteristics there are large copy number changes and employ these large-scale transitions which are kind of big breaks in the chromosomes and also mutational signature one of the Sanger mutation signatures there is mismatch repair deficiency it's also caused by homozygous deletions of a number of genes and this causes microsatellite instability and overall hyper mutation with a specific signature on and we believe that there's some form of DNA replication deficiency associated with syndicate of lost which leads to this very characteristic phenotype of focal tandem duplication so one thing that we thought of is that well since those tandem duplications exist they should also generate hugely fortunately we had a pipeline in place that was able to detect all of those different types of rearrangements and here I would like to highlight that we are quite sensitively are able to detect passenger fusions which night might not be consequential but they do generate near antigens which might be actionable in the clinical setting so if you look at the number of fusions in those cases we can indeed see that the seedy k12 mutant cases have the high number of fusions that the fusions are typically characterized by detected by our algorithms as duplications within one site event correspond confirming the size distribution or on the whole exome sequencing and from the whole genome sequencing and again this can be contrasted to the typical few genes observed in homologous recombination deficient tumors which are which are typically translocation between different chromosomes and there are relatively pure duplications and definitely fewer the definitely pure density k12 I highlight this because there is a controversy in the field whether actually CD k12 loss has its functional impact through through a deficiency in homologous recombination our results strongly suggest that homologous recombination deficiency and CD k12 loss are two very distinct phenomena so as I mentioned we can detect the fusions and the fusions have many passengers events and the passenger even tonight generate in your antigens and here with unconscious help from the lab we built a near-empty gene prediction pipeline which starts with patient sequencing data the RNA the fusions and goes through the pipeline of near antigen prediction to figure out what what might be some of the functional consequences of those rearrangements I implemented an algorithm to to allow the this particular prediction meaning how to go from the rearrangements possibly assembling across multiple breakpoints and translating hypothetical chimeric protein so that we can generate the peptides and then rank them based on their predicted affinity to binding to the MHC 1 MHC class 1 locus so if we look at the data and here this this data was generated by Pankaj we can see that that CD k12 loss results in an increase in your antigen burden it's increased relative to all the other classes of genomic instability it doesn't quite match up with mismatch repair deficiency but mismatch repair deficiency have high permutations and si and they overall generate a large number of you know antigens and consider k12 deficient cases almost all of the NIA antigens arise from fusions so this is important because right now fusions are ignored largely as a source of in your antigens our results suggest that they should be strongly considered and incorporated whenever near antigen vaccines anti-cancer vaccine are being made so the next question was obviously the fact that syndicate of mutant tumors have new antigens might help in that in somehow influencing their treatment but it doesn't tell us much about the rearrangement so the next thing we asked is whether those rearrangements are recurrent and random so the question with the first question is whether they are random it looks like we didn't find any strong association with any type of genomic signal they look to be randomly distributed the only thing that was slightly significant is that they sent tend to be enriched and tend to be enriched in genic versus intergenic regions but it's a rather rather small statistical Association whether they are recurrent well we asked this question by by developing a statistical model and here I use the permutation based model where I kind of tried to simulate what those what those rearrangement look like how they end up being positioned on the genome this allowed me to define a significance cutoff and at an FDR of 3.5% I was able to call here the black lines called the regions that seem to have higher statistically significant enrichment for their eius indicate wealth associated tandem duplications I made the smaller in two different ways a broad model which considered all tandem duplications below 10 mega bases and the narrow model which focused only on those the below two and a half mega bases obviously they detected slightly different evens but as you can see there overlap is quite quite large so when we look in detail on the most recurrent cdk 12 low loss associated gains we found a striking thing almost all of the gains were associated with almost almost all of the cases had local tandem duplications in genes associated with the cell cycle so we found cdk 18 MT and 7 cyclin d1 and a are as a positive control of a local that is under a positive selection in prostate cancer so we mapped those genes onto the cell cycle you can see that all of those genes kind of help in cell cycle progression and there are some evidence in the literature that they have that all of them have both a role in DNA damage and the role in cell cycle and some some of them have a role and prostate cancer progression so this data based on our mining of the whole exome sequencing data suggests that might have found the missing piece that the cancer cells do to be able to draw grow under the condition of cdk 12 knockout because normal cells without of those amplifications do not so the next when I when I saw this result this gave me an idea that well maybe this is something that that could be more generalizable maybe there are copy number changes that are conditional on the mutations and other types of genes so I I got the help from Raja with a master student at this department and we looked at the first very obvious questions are there any copy number changes that our differential between it's positive and it's negative or here wild-type prostate cancer what Gaja found is that tumors tumors which are positive seem to have many more copy gains across the tumor here I highlighted the most striking places were where X mutant prostate cancer tumors have more gains than at negative prostate tumors but also we found a very specific region which is deleted in 80% of s- prostate cancer this is important so although this deletion was known before because obviously it effects 30% or more even of all prostate cancer cases the fact that it's so strongly associated with its status was not known this suggests some sort of genetic interaction between because of this mutual exclusivity between the loss of 6p and adds fusion so we decided to look at this little bit deeper because there was an ongoing discussion in the literature whether actually adds mutations caused genomic instability so here we categorized all the all the tumors in into those that are p53 wild-type and ATS wild-type this is a wild-type p53 wild-type and mutant these are the cases which have mutations but are wild-type p53 the cases that are typically pre mutant and wild type and obviously the the ones are that are mutant for both of the genes as you can see there is a gradual progression in the number of copy number changes here just to show you the all the copy number changes every everything to that this wild type are to copy diploid is represented in grey and all the changes are either blue or red and as you can see while you you're progressing and gaining additional mutations the number of changes increases the most dramatic changes associated with p53 mutations so this really clearly shows that p53 really guards the integrity of the genome that only when p53 is lost and to some extent adds adds gained the genome becomes unstable the Association is particularly interpreted or in the case of p53 because p53 is inactivated through mutations rarely through copy number changes so this oriented the causality axis know that p53 mutations cause and increase in the number of copy number changes directly or indirectly cost for the EDS mutation the Association still not fully clear so of course wanted to also know what might be the effects of those copy number changes in the context of cdk 12 we first I first went back to a study that I've published previously as part of a large group and there we look at copy number changes associated with a very rare kind of kidney cancer and mixed spindle cell carcinoma as you can see this cancer is characterized by a number of copy a chromosomal deletions the deletions typically in both all chromosomes are at least chromosome arms and they are very highly the current so for example one copy of chromosome one is lost in 100% of the cases one copy of chromosome 13 is also lost in hundred percent of the cases but these tumors provide a good model to study the transcriptional of effect of copy number changes what you can see here is that all the genes on all of the chromosomes that are lost typically lose 50 percent of their expression level this means that if a whole chromosome is lost really this is at those such dependent effect if you have one chromosome rather than two you have essentially half of the half of the expression however if we look at smaller changes in the genome like focal CNVs at the neck locus regardless of how many copies are gained at this particular locus the expression of make is quite variable and you can see here that quite perplexing there isn't even a trend which means that to interpret how the copy number changes affect gene expression will be a little bit more complex so in the case of cdk 12 I decided to look at this in a more aggregated way so I looked at all of the low-side that are either diploid or have an additional copy or multiple additional copies due to the CD k12 associative disease and this can as you can see the more copies you gain the more genes are differentially expressed so here one as baseline out of the 20,000 genes about 2,000 genes are differentially expressed in this in this particular analysis and as you gain additional copies you increase your likelihood of being differentially expressed and by ten copies or more you have 50% chance of being differentially expressed a similar analysis holds that look at whether the focal tandem duplications are able to induce expression outliers and here you can see that at baseline the chance of being an outlier is very low well by the definition of outlier but each additional copy of cdk 12 FTE increases the likelihood that a given gene will be an expression out there and sometimes those expression outliers are actually the secondary oncogenic driver of cdk 12 Newton prostate cancer here for example one of the FTEs generated at K IAB refusion this this fusion is not typically observed in prostate cancer but on the other hand is very frequent in a very well in a rare type of glioma pilocytic astrocytoma so we also generated other types of our detected other types of of actively associated secondary drivers here another beer opinion and also a secondary ETV one when I looked at this little bit more broadly one could see two different kind of ways how the poco tandem duplications can affect the expression of genes if we look at the map case signaling pathway which typically contributes the genes in this pathway are typically oncogenic in most of the tumors although they are not very strongly oncogenic you can see kind of a dose dosage dependent effect where for all of the genes there is some trend of a higher expression associated with multiple copies gained on the other hand for the receptor tyrosine kinases this didn't didn't hold up and here the world outliers and these outliers might be actually the drivers of this country but but overall the outliers occurred rarely and were not associated strongly with additional Cobb so they were not stronger as additional copies [Music] there perhaps most striking think and most confusing thing about CTE 12 is that although all those poker tendon duplication associated expression changes are rare in kind of random from tumor to tumour the cancer has a striking transcription phenotype so there are there's a number of genes that are differentially expressed and cdk 12 neutral tumors compared to other types of tumors here you can see that overall syndicate 12 mutants have more differential genes than any other type of prosthetic we determined prostate cancer and here you can also see that a number of differential genes broken up by up and down genes is higher in syndicate of mutant tumors but I would like to emphasize that the differential expression of those genes is not view the focal tandem duplications it is because of something different those genes are not more frequently in the FTD's than and the genes that are not differentially expressed so with that I would like to wrap up the city k12 part and I'll go on go on to the Fox a1 and to provide a little bit more local view on the role of position effects in prostate cancer so first of all talk say one is among the most recurrently mutated genes in prostate cancer and it's also a gene that is very misinterpreted so most people associate that Fox a1 is the tumor suppressor and they figured this out because there is an enrichment of frameshift truncating mutations with box within proxy 1 however one looks more clearly at that you can see that the truncating core frameshift mutations are clustered in a very specific position of the fork head which is the DNA binding domain of our Fox a1 we also found that actually the distribution of those mutations changes the changes strongly depending if we divide the protein into two parts the pork had the main proper and the c-terminal part and the c-terminal part is very strongly enriched for frameshift mutations whereas the the mutations directly in the in the polecat domain are not not anymore so enriched and also one interesting aspect of focusing on biology is that the mutations occur only in hormone driven tumors such as prostate cancer bladder cancer and the three types of breast breast cancer so abjured Carolla from our lab generated rather than most striking chip seek data set I've ever seen where he showed that the truncating mutations of focusing one had are not loss of function like everybody thought that but there are actually gain of function but not only that he also showed that they are dominant meaning expressing the truncated Fox a1 protein gets rid of the wild-type wild-type protein from the chromatin he has many more of such striking results and I will not go into the detail without I would like to just say that we have pretty good evidence that Fox I want is actually an oncogene and that the frameshift patience but also the other types of impatience are gain-of-function but we didn't the association between fox a1 and and position effects are structural rearrangements didn't come death directly though quite quite some time ago I became interested in seeing how sensitive structural variant detection can be from RNA seek data given that at least for proteins related to oncology we achieved quite high sensitivity and specificity so if we plot the number of RNA fusions relative to the number of DNA breakpoints detected either from whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing this particular progress from whole exome sequencing you can see that there is a linear trend obviously the more DNA breakpoints there are the more clearance we detect but that actually the slope is pretty good for each hundred breakpoints we are able to detect approximately 25 fusions which means that the sensitivity of rna-seq is not that bad and on the other hand we have many more RNA seek data sets available in the public domain and also internally to look for the currency so here's one plot that shows such a recurrence plotted this one chromosome you can see all the rearrangements within a cohort they are different sometimes their duplication sometimes their translocation sometimes there are inversions but here you can see that there is a place on the chromosome which seems to have many more rearrangements than other so this gave me the idea that maybe it would be possible to identify recurrently rearranged low site based on the aggregation of the thousands of our Nasik experiments that we already have and that this could be done immediately rather than waiting for next technology to to allow to do it properly so this is what we found when applied to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer we found quite a number of recurrently rearranged low low site and as you can see the signal-to-noise ratio here is pretty high so here's the positive control you can see that the fusion that tempers to earth even highly recurrent also we can see real fusions related to a are amplifications also expected in metastatic prostate cancer rearrangements of the Mik locus reported previously but here what we found is that we see a quite a number of rearrangements affecting the Fox I wanna notice this is if we zoom in on to that locus here's chromosome 14 this is the locus where Fox a1 Fox a1 lives and you can see that all of the breakpoints detected from RNA seek cluster around the fox a one gene so those break points have been previously described at least a very small subset of them namely nipple EPV one fusions but I would like to emphasize that the breakpoints are much much more abundant that the et b1 few genes account for a couple percent of the total number of rearrangements so this is a very prevalent thing so if we look at the numbers tempers to earth as expected is rearranged in 50% of the metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancers make is rearranged in forty percent of the cases and this is followed by about 30% of rearrangements which is a very high percentage for any type of genetic even if we look whether these rearrangements associated with the progression you can see that the Mik rearrangements this are very lowly rearranged and normal samples then highly rearranged in primary tumors and then there is a very small increase in metastatic tumors verse four prophesy one the number of rearrangements drastically increases between primary and metastatic cancer suggesting that it might be related either disease progression or treatment so to confirm this since this was a discovery based on our Nasik and our there are ways our NAC can be wrong due to for example translating we decided to confirm this at the level of the DNA and here is here is one approach using whole exome sequencing what I try to do is to detect the currently rearranged los I based on the density of breakpoints detected from whole exome sequencing here's how it would look like we have a locus we have a number of breakpoints so in this particular locus there there will be four great points at least in the copy number thought to show that this approach works we can confirm the break high breaking density in tempers to positive int Empress to Erik locus high break to intensity in the p10 locus this is explained because p10 is among the most frequently deleted genes and prostate cancer and also high breaking density in the AR locus obviously these breakpoints are associated with the AER amplification so seeing that the approach works we could apply it then on chromosome 14 and try to confirm and confirm the finding our Nasik screen and as you can see there is a very high break to intensity of around the fox a Wan locus and and also you can see here on this kind of copy number plug that here's the position of Box a1 and most of the great points as detected in RNA seek data cluster around that locus we also confirm this in whole genome sequencing with sequence 9 cases here is the Fox a one locus in red are tandem duplications in green are translocations and as you can see there is a high density of breakpoints in close to the Fox a one locus so that makes it obviously interesting so why might this locus be so frequent you rearrange so first of all the most striking think about the fact that I want locus is that it's one of the most conservative satanic low site in the human genome so this is how it looks like the synchrony block extends from pax 1 to fox a1 in the human the locust was duplicated so we have X 9 and Fox 1 and X 1 and Fox a - this goes back way back to sea urchins half a billion years of those genes occurring in the genome in this relative orientation the other striking thing as we zoom into this locus just into the vicinity of fox a one we have fox a one tg6 it's right flanking gene and middle one its left blank region we see a number of highly conserved regulatory elements they really show conservation really really down way beyond vertebrates if we look at this from a more topological perspective this this locus quite similar to the HMMWV locus is divided into topological domains so here the synchrony block is shown in as this black triangle and the two topological domains are shown here if we zoom into the domain that contains fox a1 we can see that fox I want is in the center of the domain and it's kind of flanked by by interactions on both between the genes on both sides no an important thing about this locus is that very similar to the Hogs D locus the expression of the genes in this region is very tightly controlled so for example pecks 9 is really expressed and only one tissue box a1 is really expressed in one only one tissue prostate well maybe also breasts at least some cells in them and Anna breast tissue and the genes under that the tissues do not match up if we look at the which genes are co-expressed together in with Fox a1 we find that the gene that is most most frequently expressed at Fox one here the Fox I want positive tissues the most Express gene is T v6 which allows us to propose at least a very early model wherein Fox a1 t t6 are part of a regulatory domain and importantly maple one the promoter of middle one it's not part of the domain which is explained by the fact that which is supported by the fact that Fox and nipple are not color expressed so to understand this better we decided to meet some some better technology we went with whole genome sequencing 10x linked with technology I'll not explain this in detail but what this technology allows us to do is it allows us to sequence very long high molecular weight DNA molecules and bar code each molecule with a unique set of bar codes and then these bar codes allow us to resolve the position of those molecules onto the genomes of here each long molecule which can be tens to hundreds of table size is shown in a different color and this allows us to do two things it allows us to face the structural information it allows us to detect structural information first and based leveled resolution but also with much higher sensitivity compared to both whole genome sequencing and RNA seed and also provides us phasing information which means it will allow us to determine which allele is rearranged and in the case if there are multiple the arrangements whether they affect the same or different alleles so this is what we initially got from this from this analysis here we can see here we can see that the one of them or model cell lines which has had a known rearrangements in the pocket in one locus the sequence include yield that it's actually two events which was previously unknown there is a tandem duplication and also a translocation which was known between chromosome protein and the ETD one gene as I mentioned before so we looked at the phasing information and we were very surprised to see that actually both allele are rearranged in that setting allele one has a tandem duplication worse allele 2 has a breakpoint which which separates Fox a1 from its enhancer we also looked at the different cell line which also happens to have the oxygen one local rearrangement it's linked up here we detected at the same translocation between chromosome 14 and chromosome 7 but we also detected a deletion on chromosome 7 when we actually looked at this closer the deletion turned out not to be a deletion but rather but rather the whole event was a compound compound even where a chunk of chromosome 7 was inserted in the Fox a1 locus and the chunk of chromosome 14 from the folks at one locus was inserted into the inter chromosome 7 so it's a balanced insertional translocation which also explained which which also was associated with a small loss of genomic region so we then asked the question what were the expression what were the transcriptional implications of those rearrangement and here we looked we were quite lucky because although thoughts a1 is a very small gene in one of the cell line it had probably a either a mutation or a very very rare snip and in the other cell line it had to have it had two heterozygous snips which allowed us to determine whether the snips that are expressed or the snip that are not expressed are associated with the rearrangement that occurred so for all of the snips and all of the genes we found that the rearranged allele the allele that was associated with the fusion was not expressed the only allele that was expressed was the gene was the allele that was either tandem duplicated or not rearranged so here you can see that for this locus for example we have to genotype the C and the G and the C and the C genotype doesn't show almost any expression we also went to see whether this could be confirmed in a real clinical clinical sample we sought the help of a company called dovetail genomics this company and knows how to do hi-c but not but but can use FFPE tissues from from clinical specimens and this allowed us to see that actually the rearrangement which is a disk in this particular case for that sample also a tandem duplication that this results in a change in the in the topological structure of that locus so here you can see again the fox a one locus fox a one would be here in the middle interactions as predicted by the hi-c data from from the from the cell lines would spend this locus worse we only observe these interactions which allows us to propose a model where we have the fox a one locus and at least in the cell lines and conditions that we have studied so far one of the alleles is rearranged and and the hypothetic enhancer in that locus becomes the driver for the ETD one gene whereas the other allele loses access to its enhancer and also new this expression the other I'm sorry and the Fox a one gene loses access to its enhancer and the expression on the other hand the other allele is subject additionally arrangements that's the case of the second allele to restore to restore expression of Fox along because one important think about Fox I want is that it seems to be a very gene with whose dosage is very controlled so its first happen and sufficient gene but also over expression of folks I want leads to drastic phenotypes in the case of prostate cancer cell death so where other types of events like that reported not quite so if you look at recurrent positional effects in cancer this is the whole list I could amass and most of them are related to so-called enhancer swaps where the structural variant causes the expression of a gene by the acquisition of a foreign enhancer the only thing that comes really close to Fox a1 rearrangements rearrangements in the NIC locus and that only all only in the multiple myelomas where it's also like for Fox a1 late even I guess it remains determined remains to be determined whether this is a complete list I think that this is the very very tip of the iceberg because previously we were not really looking for them but also it remains to be determined how frequent those complex rearrangements like in the Fox a one locus so to just conclude my talk I think position effects provide a framework for the interpretation of structural variation we can integrate and think about structural variation by integrating genetic recurrence which we can do from whole genome sequencing data or exome sequencing data and RNA we can integrate on top of it the transcriptional changes that the logical domains I think very importantly evolutionary relationships but also the developmental and clinical genetics so insights into how to deal with the germline congenital diseases really can inform how we think about structural rearrangements in cancer the other thing I would like to emphasize that epistasis are synthetic dependencies between snv's and drivers and CN bees are under explored so really nobody showed conclusively how p53 loss leads to genomic instability those types of those types of Association might provide us insight both on the oncogenic role of the mutations but also in their oncogenic roles of the C and B's so for example the recurrent loss in 6p it might tell us something actually about what the oncogenic role of Earth is which has eluded explanation for the last 10 years and also we might remain through this approach identifying new molecular subtypes of cancer perhaps six prostate cancer with the 6p loss should be considered a molecular subtype and perhaps it is associated with with differences in prognosis and here currently doing those types and I like to emphasize that it is for cancer linked with technology is is a game changer haplotype result as these are really useful and also at least as computational tools mature this release will provide us with improved sensitivity of structural variant detection I would like to emphasize one idea that was very very difficult to address without me sequencing this is my topic crossing over in cancer right we often talk about none and really Kamala guess recombination in cancer but what about I nearly come all of this recombination in cancer these changes cannot be detect without phasing information provided by by technologies like this and I would also like to mention that we are currently a little bit limited we have no good statistical framework to quantify recurrence at the structural level right probably it shouldn't be arbitrary windows in the genomes it should be something more like a topological domain or maybe not maybe a replication domain and also our current approaches or at least the ones that were published to detect rearrangements of whole genome sequencing data are limited and which was a very learning experience for me I was not really aware that our understanding of germline structural variation in humans so with that I'd like to thank first I would like to thank students I'm working with they make everything fun so I would like to thank them and also the small band rheumatics staff who works with e they allow me to focus on many things and they they are so with that I would like to thank all the other people I'd like to thank roll the genomics group the vine chromatic group and of course the clinicians pathologist Bao gist and of course my collaborators here at divine dramatic Department and also [Applause] so so in the city k12 mutant tumor she said with or and ICQ got a specific pattern of gene expression I was different yeah does that have anything to do with gene sighs yes yeah so we tested for this so the literature suggests that these should be long genes that are differentially expressed because C D k12 has been implicated in the splicing of the last axon particularly our splicing of the last intron we then find the signal I'm not totally confident that the signal is in there because we are still working with the clinical samples and we cannot generate the knockout cell lines because they are not viable so we cannot really will rule this out completely but there was no statistical difference that genes as a whole they didn't fall into any kind of gene set that might be enriched so there's nothing I could tell you about those genes they as far as I can tell are pretty pretty random now in terms of size their average yeah I picked it's a tip of the iceberg thing you said is probably true mean it looks like you might be able to discover a new class of regulatory variants the way that alan boyle no there's the art menhir have done so our group and steven other looks like a nice you know and it opens the door for work with the the topologically associated domains and on the tabs and I think that's probably going to be a meaningful structural component in your analysis going forward including I see measurements so when you send things to dovetail how does that work I mean is that hadn't heard about that well we are sterling the very early process we still are working out you know how to do this dove tail has their emphasis on detecting structural variants they think that's their core strength I think their core strength is actually doing hi seen at the clinical specimens so it's a challenging collaboration from that perspective but I think definitely they know there are molecular biology which is which is even for advanced labs often often very difficult touching they definitely know what they're doing yeah looks like a good director thinking where do you where you find the next I thought the conclusions were solid and expansive but where do you what do you want to take this marcin well III think right now we are just beginning to be allowed to use the ICGC structural whole genome sequencing data sets and from everything that I've seen published pre-printed that the approaches that have been used didn't discover anything so I'll write so that I we I think we have pretty strong evidence for the rearrangements in the proximal locus and prostate cancer was already sequence quite a number of times using whole genome sequencing data so those rearrangements are there they were just missed they are missed over and over and over again people-people sequence sequence more but do not detect them and i think this is mostly a result of a lack of framework or their aggregation the individual events are detected the recurrence is not so I think one of the biggest challenges in report will actually not be the improvements in detection because this is really limited by the technology that we are using but really the algorithms to determine recurrence what is recurrent what isn't recurrent and how we can use other types of information actually on those algorithms and recurrence analysis algorithm shouldn't take just BAM house or Alliance or cold struck from variant needs to take into account to the biology it needs to take into account the expression and once it does it I think that right so modeling in the biological context one yeah analysis I guess the one thing that could because he mentioned you were gonna speak about the algorithms and you know I guess I'm coming for more of a computer science background but I did see the one diagram where it could be construed as an algorithm so that would be a good thing to continue to discuss a little bit yes don't have to be now but yeah I guess I guess the you know sequence analysis is all the same all that great point assembly algorithms that go into RNA sit could be a Python sequencing data or link read data for that for that matter so these things are pretty similar but I think it's the added information that that is valid so for example if we interpret the variants in a given cancer attack you should probably anchor them on at least the topological domains on this cancer type as they usually yeah yeah unit of recurrence that's a big big big implication I think for this work you know and it was it's definitely there but that could be that it's a future direction that's can certainly be fleshed out and you know this in the context of all your rearrangements you know that it's going to be a complex and interesting problem I I think I think it's also I mean ultimately ultimately it's not the technical arrangements for the sake of the arrangements ultimately in this small deleted six p locus this narrows down the number of genes to 20 we don't know yet which track but it becomes very feasible to actually functionally implicate a specific mentioned the jeans at work but I think you know some recent studies that we've been doing has been suggesting that those gene sets would live in what live within a topologically associated domain and you know some of the some of these genes if you get the topology down that might help you understand you know where the fusion elements are placed and where the jeans are and it could just simply be a part of you know if you think back to the you know kind of standard diagrams of you know DNA and the nucleosomes in chromatin and then heterochromatin and loops it's pretty clear that that diagram isn't quite right you can maybe talk about it at dinner but I believe the topologically associated domains are gonna be fitting in there the Hansa promoter pairs so you have those those kind of loops how those are organized as Tad's and then how those create you know either unit based chromosome territories or banded metaphase chromosomes I think if we redraw those we could reinterpret a lot of them a lot of the functions that you're seeing in the cancer context are in the normal context in a more sophisticated way and I think you know your work is pointing in that direction it's very good drawing my best ok anything else well let's please thank Marcin again that was really a tour de force of bioinformatics analysis and we really appreciate it we all learned something [Applause] now I never win
