every one doctor williscroft our former dean in the fellow who helped us get the center for computational medicine and bioinformatics together and shepherded that through to the part mental status starting January 1 2012 is here Thank You dr. Willis scarf economy it's great to see you and thank you for your support of us all Gill and I were thinking back to who had preceded our honored guests dr. post as the omen lecturers we remembered that Leroy hood gave the first one from the Institute of systems biology and it was a dynamic presentation of you know boots on the ground decision and personalized medicine it's really kind of for the precision medicine nomenclature came to then second we had Zack kahani Isaac kahani who is now the chair of biomedical informatics at Harvard University a special Gilman story he was the mentor and chair of the committee with two esteemed colleagues that helped support dr. kahan ease planning and ultimately meeting with the Dean in his role as chair of the visiting committee of the Harvard Medical School that shepherded Union biomedical informatics as a department in Harvard in medical quod there that was a big job and you know it was really neat to see in the crimson that they were following the Michigan model I remember biomedical informatics and then we were scratching our head we were thinking God there was another speaker we were embarrassed to say that took us two minutes remember well it must be nice when you forget somebody like DE Shaw who was our third annual omen lecturer had a de Shaw research founder of the famous international hedge fund and now computational biologists who gave a wonderful lecture that last year computational chemist you can see he's still correct and now we had the fourth you know we are very pleased to say that this is an endowed lectureship and I know some of the folks have contributed that dominar here and we want to thank their each and every one of you you know which allows us to bring in internationally recognized thought leaders like dr. post and I'm just the brief mentioned dr. omen is a leader who leads through example he goes to the seminars he meets with the students he will be interacting at every poster session he mentors the chair he mentors the associate chairs he mentors the faculty mentors the students he is the distinguished professor the Harold T Shapiro distinguished University professor and his home department his DCM be where he co-founded the Center for computational medicine and bioinformatics in 2005 and you know he is my mentor and we are so lucky to have him and we couldn't think of anybody better fast and someone like dr. post to come and share the special day with us so Gil I'm going to turn it over you to make the introductions and we can get started thank you very much for being me [Applause] okay thank you very much Brian thank you Jim for coming thank you David for coming thank you all for coming it's really great you know if some of you could move in a little there are people standing in the back afraid to climb over you so it might be helpful it's good sign nothing like filling the auditorium okay our guest George post I would described as a larger-than-life figure in the world of pharmaceutical development and in a whole broader world of biomedical research and the role of medicine and science in the larger society for example he is a member of National Academy of Medicine member of the Royal Society of London he's on the board of the Hoover Institution remember you just telling me about his special interest in the Council on Foreign Relations and probably any of you watched the sunday new shows know that they are top of the line and what they do he had bought property and because sort of fell in love with Arizona I guess and back in the early 90s when he was a head of research and development president research organization from SmithKline pharmaceutical company and based in Philadelphia and author the night DC LED R&D at Smith Kline as far as connections to Michigan the most notable of many achievements there was his recruitment of tachi llamada whom many of you will remember in this head of gastroenterology here and he was the chairman of medicine shortly before I arrived but he had already gone to Smith Kline and what was sort of cute about that was he kept up while he was doing his big job which became a much bigger job when he eventually succeeded doctor post kept up his activities here his son was here in school and his staff was here for his steamed textbook of gastroenterology which I think still continues in its latest addition anyway all of those years he had an office he would come by very curious but I was going to do as a new guy here in Ann Arbor and quite a nice friendship came from all that he and I together serve on the board of the Council of National Academy medicine currently kind of medicine that does a lot of interesting things they have among many other activities working group on which George post served which is looking to what could be more socially and socially responsible and friendly to innovation for what the pricing of drugs in our society may be salient topic especially with tweets and other sources of advice so I wish you well you and your colleagues on that little task currently George is at a most remarkable institutional peer institution for us a fast-rising place called Arizona State University Michael crow went there about 20 years ago to do things differently with American higher education to build around big ideas and to develop new kinds of names for things that would bring people from social sciences and physical sciences and humanities and engineering outside together do big things for society I would say it's turned out remarkably well George was recruited to found what's called the Biodesign Institute at ASU and he was the director from 2003 to 2009 he could use there as the chief scientist for initiative called complex adaptive systems he's a Regents professor and he holds the del Webb chair in health innovation he received many of words which you can look up if you're interested but most what probably is commander of the British Empire awarded by the majesty Elizabeth in 1999 George great pleasure to have you here with us everybody was met with you been thrilled and we're very good to hear your talk Joe thanks so much thank you Brian Gill thank you for the kind introduction and it is with warm reciprocity that it's a great honor to be given this lecture on behalf of Gilman who I not only known for a very long time but have followed with great admiration and the broad swath of subject matter we discussed this afternoon very much embodies his career in everything from being in the vanguard of initiatives in public health and epidemiology but linking it with advances in cell and molecular biology and looking at it in the broadest possible context of what that means for contemporary education in research so he'll thank you it's a great honor to be here the title is definitively broad not because I have a passion for alliterative X been in the title but it is just the fact that these are undoubtedly formative trajectories but equally it is the fact that all of these do actually have a measure of interaction and overlap and all of them will shape the evolution of this somewhat diffuse concept which we call precision medicine and I will try to produce some greater precision or clarity to that but this is all just a subset of what is going to unfold in terms of challenges for the US healthcare system it's it also could be argued challenges for healthcare systems in the g8 and g20 countries but certainly looking at in the context of the US I epitomize the infinite demand namely the gray-haired baby boomers who are about to potentially bankrupt the health system and we do not have sufficient clinical infrastructure yet alone economic infrastructure to deal with this issue which carries clearly not only profound clinical implications but it's going to confront society with some very difficult choices we're moving from volume-based or what might or offensively be called doom or bill more medicine in terms of fee for service as opposed and looking at this for value-based care how do we make healthcare less fragmented in responding not just to win you or I feel ill and present ourselves to the healthcare system but achieve a far greater continuity of care and at the same time continuity of care means that the various components of the care system are linked and the final goal of all of that is a desire a course to try and deal with the first bullet there how do we improve clinical outcomes at lower cost and how do we optimize wellness as opposed to reactivity to illness and where where everyone in this room fits in in terms of technology and innovation what does that translate to in terms of addressing those objectives and so I start with demographics not just because I am a member of this cohort but this is our challenge is it wellness and longevity with high quality of life or what we're confronted with at the present time which is an elderly population in which there are a multiple comorbidities and low quality of life these this is the broader strategic challenge the medical Titanic is about to collide with at least two giant icebergs the first is in oncology where again as a consequence of demographics alone we anticipate that every major malignancy will increase 20% by 2020 we do not have I again apologies for the reiteration the resources to handle this the neurodegenerative neuropathies clearly are of equal clinical and economic impact diabesity and then at some point will some form of wild cards such as pandemic influenza visit us that all has to be put into the law your social economic calculus of Public Health precision medicine we will attempt to define it but I suspect it will remain elusive as we go through but nonetheless it is the current tag du jour with regard to many aspects of this the president making an announcement that was then followed by further announcements for how the fda would respond to that then the larger precision medicine initiative in September and complementing that in oncology vice president's in the initiative in the moonshot all of which was captured in the so-called 21st century cures which was passed by the house at the end of the year but I think this title from the Journal of precision medicine sums it up the iceberg of hope and complexity so it's not a question of when will precision medicine occur but what will it be when the what will occur how will that occur who's going to implement it and how do we define the value of that intervention so that's essentially this lecture but I think if we're seeing in my opinion I could use less I could use more offensive terms but many Institute's particularly in the oncology space are actually in my opinion misrepresenting the patient's the precision medicine is already here and you only have to look at I could show you five or six I'm not singling out these institutions I could show you five or six slides with comparable advertising from others which are now spending tens of millions of dollars in my opinion to make in extravagant claims that they cannot substantiate but that's the end of the the sermon there I would define precision medicine as having two major axes the first is research where most of us are engaged which is the question of how far molecular biology is now permitting a new molecular taxonomy of disease and elucidation of the disease mechanisms at the molecular level on the other hand we have the entire framework of healthcare delivery where the search is on for so-called real-world evidence the acronym rwe under the rubric of what has been advancing under of last few years of how do we convert healthcare into a learning healthcare system and by the way these slides are available on the website if and if you want them so you don't have to take undue notes because they pass a great speed so this really essentially though follows the following and that is the fact that research will drive us to understand disease not only new with the new molecular taxonomy we will define particular subpopulations and phenotypes that represent that on the other hand the healthcare pot delivery system is for the most part dealing with populations but it is a virtuous circle because you need the data starting at the top but these large-scale aggregated population databases to permit you to then moving through the circle to begin to ID identify ID particular patterns associated either with clinical presentation or particular molecular phenotypes to identify those how far then you can correlate the existence of those sub populations or subtypes with particular patterns of clinical disease progression and response to therapy that drives new approaches to guidelines that should create this reinforcement circle in so there is really no distinction between population health and an individual in some population health but the glue that is going to be needed to hold all of this together whether at the research level or the healthcare delivery system is large-scale data aggregation curation and analysis the words are easily stated but clearly a two-week symposium lurks within that green circle with many imperfections embedded in it because I would argue this is where we are today in the red boxes most of our information is qualitative descriptive and the dubious quality and provenance and we have to move this to the green boxes where data becomes much more definitive in the terms of being quantitative and having validate equality characteristics and we go from a situation in which the healthcare system is an ecosystem of largely unconnected data sources to where we have to move to a far more seamless interconnectivity but of course all of this drives to one fundamental principle core value and value differs wherever you live in this circle so nonetheless this mere purpose of this slide is to say that the contribution to what we would view as value namely improved health with quality of life at lower cost these are all of the transactional components that have to be considered in that and each one of them would give a different definition of value so if we stay within the research circle that we showed earlier before we go to the healthcare delivery circle I always again again apologies for any alliteration I would argue that the overall intellectual progression of biomedicine has been from superstition to symptoms we are still largely a symptom based diagnostic culture but increasingly signatures of disease at the molecular level are beginning to build this new understanding of the molecular classification of disease with the aim that pan omics and I make no apologies for the utilization of that term requires an assessment on a systems based way of what it what are the perturbations that occur from lesions in the genome or epigenome to then be reflected in downstream molecular networks what does that then mean in terms of any given subpopulation or individual and what are the signatures of disease as it would relate to the particular patient who's been presented and so what that means of course is we're going from the first set of open white circles there one disease diabetes colon cancer whatever take your pick to divide increasingly into subpopulations of varying sizes so that's the second tier there and begin to then also ask what sits within the blue dots at the bottom as to whether there are shared network perturbations in diseases in the same organ class what our example linkages between perturbations in different CNS diseases autoimmunity and so forth in oncology or maybe shared similarities early in disease progression but very few much later one example amongst many from a paper in science showing here in relation to diabetes and autoimmune disease how many elements of network perturbation overlap between different disease spectra within each of those and of course this then brings us to the whole issue of how do we interpret variation in individual genomes now 150 million variants identified one variant every five or six base pairs are 80 million lying outside of coding regions not yet sample in the full spectrum of the human race but in terms of what does this mean clinically how do we create and we're a long way from it in my opinion appropriate filters to be able to say in this entire repertoire of genomic variation that's just at the snip level before we get to other forms of variation like copy number variation and so forth but this is going to be a daunting informatics challenge and just look at this relative is's speculative from a paper in 2015 but the numbers are probably approximately correct in terms of the only thing we have to look at is those boxes at the bottom an exodus of sequence per year azita base by 2025 and the numbers of genomes which are being postulated that's just a primary genome sequence level before you even get to an epigenome or any other of the omics domains and if anyone made the most superficial calculation of the computational horsepower needed to start analyzing this or the infrastructure and the cost of that investment I think you would end up with a sim sony endure and we see these things basically being proposed in complete isolation without any understanding we see new business alliances just announced the JPMorgan conference IBM bringing its skills together with Illumina and Phillips to at least at the genome sequence level begin to turn loose large scale machine learning and artificial intelligence method but of course all of this will be dependent upon the adequacy of the clocks proximal data inserted but I believe we're dangerously close once again to allowing reductionism to run rampant because the genes for syndrome' is alive and well and the simplified perspective that exome and whole genome sequencing is going to reveal the etiology of disease pathogenesis I think is summed up here and that is the fact that I on a similar slide I have a herd of sheep as opposed to the Pied Piper of Hamelin but nonetheless the belief that somehow we should put all of our money in the precision medicine initiative into genome sequencing I think will simply mean that we generate a lot of data but very little insight genome sequencing alone will not suffice it's fundamental but it's necessary but not sufficient we have to understand this very complex interplay between an omics with all of the omics I forget there's a UC Davis site I think that lists the number of omics I think the last time I checked it was something like 400 omics now exists not all of them in biomedicine but and I suppose if you include the Biblio you could add one more for the literature but we clearly you've got to ask begin this very complex intellectual journey as how does this vitally important information on the epigenome and all the other elements of molecular biology we can understand but what does that then mean as to how it is modulated perturbed in relation to the environment because the question of not only our insights into the RNA universe the bergeon in RNA universe epistatic interactions all these issues the regulatory complexity associated with this is daunting and barely scratched the surface but it's the overall issue of how do we understand the molecular networks that constitute the patterns of cellular differentiation in each of the 326 cell types that exist but that begins and ever expansive scale as we subtype cell types further but most importantly how does the perturbation of those molecular signaling information networks lead to disease and another simple example of why sequencing are not alone is not enough is from oncology if you look at the 60 approved drugs that you could prescribe as an oncologist on the basis of profiling your patients only the top yellow pie segment only those drugs can be identified in the context of sequencing utilization of the rest of the drugs require non sequencing methodologies and if you look at the two there PEM bro and levo at the bottom the latest categories of amino oncology agents cannot be identified on the basis of sequencing alone because our challenge clearly stating the obvious to this audience is what is the spectrum of perturbation that gives rise to clinical disease it is clearly other than acute infectious disease or trauma it is for the most part of progressive continuum in that network perturbation and what level for each of us is some measure of subclinical disease in incubation I hope not too seriously in most of us but nonetheless is probably underway because the challenge I don't know what the timeframe for the resolution is going to be but it is the deconvolution of these very complex signaling networks so the hair border type diagram shown on the top and having to deal with both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this because they're dealing with this so even if we can narrow down a particular signaling network that we're interested in the challenge is going to be how do we gain sufficient accuracy to look at the shifts in that particular pathway and the multiple pathways that are embedded in the hair more because then our desire of course would be to shift the perturb Network the best you can do with any complex adaptive system that exhibits emergent behavior you can never totally control the behavior of that network or predict it but can you in fact channel it along those red lines there to at least a preferred state the desired state as opposed to allowing the network to shift to what I called n d1 and d2 and so forth so these concepts are easily stated but the technical translation is we are profoundly difficult and then clearly as we move into the elegant studies some of which are being done here in terms of understanding the genome in three and four dimensions this is going to be fundamentally important as to how the topological arrangement of the genome chromosome against chromosome in both sis and trans translation so this is going to be a fascinating intellectual exercise but then of course we come to the issue already stated how do we integrate diverse datasets against whatever omics data we have to really then understand the impact of environmental factors across the continuity of the life span lifestyle factors behavior an environment once again easily stated but it will have to but we will have to assimilate these datasets if we are ever going to achieve robust geno phenotypic relationships and then one more omer course is the microbiome already insights that suggests not only but the composition of your microbiome and it's perturbations can impact nutrition obesity autoimmunity increase in the neuro immunology and we're also beginning to find examples now where your microbiome impacts your therapeutic response and certainly or adverse events to therapeutics I mean one of the more interesting ones in relation to the new categories of immuno oncology agencies predisposition to colitis is associated with perturbations in the microbiome but the following two circles are meant to illustrate an important part of my talk if you recall earlier my two circles will have equal science research and healthcare delivery I would argue that the trajectory for era one in precision medicine is actually going to come much more from analyzing the data that we already have in the healthcare system as opposed to what we will contribute in terms of our discovery in innovation I had the question mark will there be a larger return from the analysis of real-world data and pan omics driven innovations against the goal have improved outcomes quality and resource allocation at lower cost my lesson is more optimistic later when the two circles begin to have a similar size but in the shorter term I believe that the translation of these very complex questions on the discovery side and may very well lag behind what we can achieve by really looking at what we know about healthcare delivery because looking to that second circle so the larger red circle they're beginning to think about health care beyond the clinic most interactions with the healthcare system occur outside of formal healthcare settings and so the rise of remote healthcare monitoring whether it be smartphones or the other elements they're colloquially known as M for making meta medicine more mobile so we enter a new era of course and that is the fact that who knows why people do what they do this is not trumpian in its identification the fact is they do and most importantly now the digital exhaust that all of us leave behind gives increasing precision to the question of what we have been doing and if you have these large enough datasets it isn't just that social media and advertisers and others can do it it is how has profound implications for medicine and clearly well beyond medicine the ethical and legal issues listed there as well but it does provide a very real opportunity to link these to the question of improve patient care how do we engage patients in better understanding of their personal responsibilities to health management tracking their health status while the biggest single problems as many of you know is therapeutic adherence large numbers of patients do not take the prescribed medicines in the appropriate way how do we develop longitudinal incentives for compliance and change and that of course requires principles of data capture the mobile phone and the sort of beast on the hip as opposed to the beast on the wrist as opposed to the beast on the hip our khloé now beginning to be used increasingly in this regard we're seeing the periphery medical selfies in terms of whether it be obstetrics ophthalmology cardiology or a rather disturbing situation in which Syria peered to do better than board-certified dermatologists in actually identifying Premal anodic and Mela notic lesions and then of course not just in the context of rural medicine telemedicine and transfer of information back to a sophisticated practitioner becomes important and in the consumer world so here's a company virtual healthcare you can look at the numbers I have linkages to a hundred thousand and these in the US across 3,000 cities and these are essentially virtual consults it's another element I'm not arguing in favor of this necessarily but it is just a narrative of the dimension of this issue of monitoring health outside smart materials so will they be electronics whether it be a floor and for that changes color because of bacterial contamination of the wound or the smart medicine container when you think the average 65 year old is taking three medicines the average 75 year-old is taking eleven medicines even without cognitive decline a question of understanding therapeutic adherence so the so-called jellybean pill count namely a Belly jelly bean because the sensor is same casas jelly bean you can tell when the container was opened and how much was taken out and we've even now seen of course the chip on the on the pill you know to track adherence that way we're seeing more and more implantable devices and wireless monitoring of those come to the fore each one of these could of course be a seminar in their own right and of course not just theoretical issues the FDA is very concerned about software security in medical devices even without the intervention of malicious attack just what is the safety of these devices but overwhelmingly the so-called gray technologies these can make enormous contributions in terms of Boadicea Darren's new patents of cognitive stimulation for the Aged in-home support reduced office visit by robotic telemedicine available in the home and so forth so a great deal of investments being made in this arena and of course whether you have a whether you have Siri or Alexa or any of the others that begin to intrude on our lives is conversational digital assistance and now we have curry I don't know why they don't make them more attractive but nonetheless that's the robot the issue is the fact that if these companies which have never been involved in healthcare before are getting involved in healthcare and anyone who thinks that this isn't going to be a rude shock for elements of healthcare delivery is in for some rude surprises because these are going to be very important informational resources for patients but it does mean that if you're gonna have an apps based information economy these are the challenges first of all many of the developers don't have access to high-quality data to actually validate the platform they're putting forward in so many elements of biomedicine cross standardization interoperability across different platforms isn't given enough attention and the FDA is appropriately concerned about what is the accuracy security and privacy of sort of data coming off these devices and they're beginning to look at some of them of classifying them as Class three devices which means you will have to go through a full IDE approval process and we're seeing the Federal Trade Commission now taking an interest in apps that make unsubstantiated claims perhaps they could also go back and look at some of the Cancer Center issues that I spoke about earlier but but there are other issues standards who integrates and interprets this data very fundamental issues about who pays if you expect a healthcare professional to examine this data who consents the use of that data particularly if that data is some being to larger data sets would you use did I consent for the use of that data who owns this data coming off these remote devices all these issues are undergoing iteration if you look at the price tag paper in Health Affairs just published the order is perhaps not surprising other than most people will be surprised to find mental disorders at the top of that list and it is not just the issue of the opioid crisis it is many many other issues contribute to this so how far will some of these methodologies begin to apply huge investments being made both by the military and the social media companies in facial recognition technologies those will begin to start the spillover because analysis of facial expression and other cognitive cues in terms of social interaction are beginning to be looked at in this context of can you in fact utilize these automated techniques to really begin to profile a patient in terms of gaze speech I mean clearly things like pupilary flick and dilatation of being used for some time but this is a far more sophisticated approach to this and how far AI and other methods can in fact begin to create a far more sophisticated identification of the CNS disorders they're an equally important you've got to have a way to alert the care team and then of course there is this issue which is alien to some this may be a generational gap do you solemnly swear to have no involvement in your own care I think we're going to see that change because patients are no longer patient for solutions we see more and more patient communities come together ad versus group and their own involvement because empowered patients are beginning to become a reality it's a logical extension of their expectations so called liquid expectations some other uses of social media more transparent information about treatment options their cost how do how does the University of Michigan compare we've go into the Cleveland Clinic or go into UCLA all of these metrics are beginning to begin to play into this new clinical practice tools which are going to be needed and user experience UX orbit I'm important in this so that's just a superficial surfer cross the background of those two circles research and healthcare delivery but here really comes the hard part how do you start driving this into routine clinical practice the data sets by definition a diverse Dell calibrated how do you create new incentives and delivery models against this this applies equally to any knowledge intense Enterprise this is blue plaque when he was head of hewlett-packard doing his very successful years and said if only we knew what HP knows would be three times more productive and profitable if we actually could harness him well and we stopped everything today and actually looked at a macro sense about what we could really keys out of that big red circle in terms of information about what we know works or what we know doesn't work so there's a huge seam of data to be mined in this but we come back to a slide you saw earlier that this is for the data we're generating data in copious deluge volumes at the research level a great deal of concern about how much of that data at the research level is actually reliable or reproducible the circle gets smaller as we translate that the biological insight and they gets smaller still women translate that body that deluge of information back into something which is clinically actionable I think that will change but that's a at least my perspective on where we are today because the purple you've seen all of these circles before but I now enlarge the green one because large-scale data aggregation creation analysis unprecedented scale how do we build standards how do we build interoperability how do we deal with open data and sharing and the rise of technologies that certainly I am ill-equipped to really understanding the fundamentals but the issue of machine and artificial intelligence and how that then drives increasingly to automated decision support systems so we're in this world of how do we capture real world data and the evidence and integrating those because but the theoretical level every encounter is a data point every individual is a data node and every individual is therefore lysergic acid every single individual who's touched by the University of Michigan healthcare system my definition is therefore a potential research participant and every individual is their own control what is my Delta between my physical last year versus my Delta one year from now and two years from now again concepts which easily stated the implementation and logistics are substantial but the momentum is growing these are the types of large-scale data sets electronic health claims data pharmacy data disease registry etc all the things you can read there and then going on what does that then tell us in that big red circle about incidence and prevalence of disease burden comorbidities who are the sub pops socio-economic disparities what which clinical groups are doing well which clinical groups aren't in relation to the fundamentals of the outcomes and cost and trends analysis because that is where all of this is headed we're seeing more and more initiatives to drive data into open data not only meaning the mean at the National coordinators requirement for meaningful use electronic health record data open FDA and FDA Center data the 21st century cures bill just passed places a premium on this and we're seeing expansion of clinical trial access data not only from the pharmaceutical companies but the 21st century cures bill reinforces this issue of open publication of trial data all this is then leading to larger and larger networks of Association that particular report shown on the site can soar pedia is well worth a read because it shows how universities are becoming increasingly broad in forming these multi institution consortium in much the way that our colleagues and experimental physics have been doing for some time and you needn't worry about the white dots there they're just a few examples of the Institute extrapolated from this report that just show that in order to look at these large scale data population sets but it does mean that the line between classical clinical research investigational research and real-world analytics is blurring because precision medicine is also forcing us to have to think about new clinical trial designs away from the classical gold standard randomized clinical trial so we're seeing the rise of pragmatic trials registries for in real world evidence and even the FDA is now saying that they're prepared to accept real-world evidence for approval of second indications after a first indication has been improved but this is the challenge the problem with the real world data is the real world Lee and I always like this quote from TS Eliot hell is the place where nothing connects welcome to biomedical research and patient that medical records however it's changing but we are living for the most part with the legacy of data tombs unstructured hoards siloed incompatible variable quality in mobile and Static a rather savage indictment of the billions of dollars which have been spent in the past decades to create essentially a Tower of Babel at many levels so the future of course is going to be driven by these large-scale analytics which at one level can take structured data such as predefined electronic medical record fields diagnostic codes etc and linking that with essentially that that red circle there should be small relative to the unstructured data but because so much of the data that we have both of the research level and the clinical level is actually unstructured so how do we actually create the fusion between those and now the course is a challenge so here is a paper from JAMA a couple years ago a busy a chart and it serves to illustrate just the diversity of datasets which you've got to be starting to be integrated if we're going to think in this holistic way but equally important if we're going to build the data Commons for this how will we ensure that this is in place for multiple databases how can proprietary databases be integrated into this we've already seen this in the back of one situation in terms of the myriad database on the one hand witnesses public databases are we going to see the introduction of compulsory access schemes versus incentives for sharing but it is this another variation on the green circle what is colloquially known as the v6 problem volume of data of variety velocity veracity virtualization and value and then the other acronyms are shown there as well because this represents a truly formidable challenge put in more pictorial terms we're already dealing with most institutions with petabyte and terabyte data sources and we're quickly heading to exabyte scale what are going to be the formats for integration longitudinal integration new analytics for natural language processing computational infrastructure and an equally powerful gap in terms of inadequate personnel to deal with this challenge by definition health data carries a particular sensitivity as more and more this data is moved to the cloud what will be the security provisions to be put in place so a one-level identifiable individual data in the purse purple circle there the rise of informed consent with legal provisions such as HIPAA the aggregation aggregated de-identified data contains varying levels of probabilistic consent but then of course is everything that you and I are revealing every day about ourselves by what we do what we touch off the beast on the hip the Beast on the wrist our cars any other interaction that we do in terms of purchasing and so forth really is beginning to create essentially there is no such thing as anonymity any longer and as the head of Sun Microsystems a couple of years ago rather offensive but nonetheless he said if there's no security to get over it and this is the world we will have to live in so how do we actually then handle that but where its value can be is in this complex lifestyle behavior issue of the expose oh how do we tell him what I've done as to how far that's influencing my risk and so forth and touched on this but I think that the other element of this of course is what does this mean in terms of how we as professionals cope there's not only the data deluge in terms of the v6 problem it's our own cognitive bandwidth how do we start to basically manage these huge data flows in terms of automated analytics and decision support and not in any way to relegate highly sophisticated professional competence to a traffic light chart but we will have to get to that in many situations green you do it red you don't do it and yellow amber will remain ambiguous but we will move increasingly for that setting we already see in the quest for robust evidence so if you look at the latest issue of Java you will see how does this help the busy physician off the off the off the phone specialized groups being set up with the American Medical Association to try and deal with this data deluge evidence issue drinking from the fire hose but it's much more profound than that it is what are the limits to our own individual expertise one of the implications of this for the future future teaching curriculum whether it be for healthcare professionals or researchers its limits to our multidimensionality our sensory systems and to our objective decision-making so it is this essentially we've been used to dealing with isolated data most of us grew up will be trained only to deal with that we're now in increasingly in a world of complexed network data but the next phase which is about to unfold is this issue of computing dealing with computed data so it is that next phase that will wait so it is one of issues like this what is going to be the future of search and retrieval content and context and what many this is a time a turn comes from the military collapsed the time to decision how do you ensure that you have intelligence of the gesture and that will become increasingly the overarching issue and with attribution in a moment to this quote why wait for the slow brain to catch up with a fast machine is the issue at hand we're seeing the first follies of artificial intelligence into the marketplace we saw a few of those in an earlier slide in relation to things like Alexa and other conversational digital assistants but we're seeing it this momentum is beginning to grow but most importantly this amounts to the question of how far can deep learning and machine intelligence actually help us with a far deeper and profound understanding of linking structural text with unstructured data with unstructured data equally important how do we begin to search all things not just the things that we're used to our convenience but the higher spectrum of data inputs why should you have to ask first you see increasingly the prompts but they given you not only when you type but also the other suggestions as to what your preference is may be and there is the quant to read more at LexA lytx why wait for the slow machine to pick up other slow brain to catch up to the fast machine we already see in their scene image recognition we had discussions on this this morning is this a viable future for pathologists radiologists ophthalmologists and those interested in cardiovascular architecture or any form of imaging methodology how far before these types of technologies essentially render all of the professional participants in these fields other than conservative professional push back render them essentially effete this is not meant to be humorous it's meant to have a measure of importance if you found out your dog was an Android would you still love it and if you found out your boss with a robot would you still obey the directives there's a lot of profound questions that lurk within both of those in terms of them directory of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the next 10 years some of you in this room are too young to remember the film 2001 but nonetheless it is the fact that in terms of the utilization of large scale come computational analytics leading to decision support and the flawed human in the loop Dave the machine says Dave I can't let you do that and what we're already seeing in some of these very large-scale and high complexity systems outside of medicine is what is called gate gated autonomy namely that the artificial intelligence the machine intelligence and artificial intelligence systems outstripping the human decision capacity that when the decision is made by a human it's not allowed to take it pause for silence because living in a world where the data analytics and interpretational algorithm obscure to the end-user we're for the most part they're due practicing physicians really understand the interpretation of complex multiplex Diagnostics unequivocally not they're charged with fifteen minutes to see a patient and they want rapid traffic light decisions to be able to ensure that they can move on in a productive way but ceding decision authority to computerized decision support is culturally alien to all of us who've invested a great deal of intellectual effort to achieve our professional competency but we accepted in all other aspects of our lives so I'd like every time you read the newspaper if there is such a thing as a newspaper any longer you read something you know something about you say that's right and then you read the remaining 99% as if it's true right and so these are very important bifurcations that we're approaching so who will have the responsibility for validate the oversight of critical assumptions in decision trees for intelligence and ingestion what is the role of the regulatory agencies and professional associations in setting those threshold standards will it be humans will it be machines a combination of both because there are some profound issues here that go well beyond biomedicine many of you are well aware we've already seen not only the hypocrisy of politicians standing in front of rusting Great Lakes manufacturing facilities in the belief that somehow traditional manufacturing is coming back it ain't you only have to look at the impact of robotics are in many industries we're seeing lower middle skilled workers placed at risk if a task can be digitized it will be analyzed and the value of humans in the loop may only prosper as a consequence of what value they can generate in terms of data with apologies to alliteration for some of the colleagues I met with this morning I tell my graduate students and postdocs much of your career is going to be determined by 4/8 not the number-8 of words ending a te the first is you're going to be in a data intensive world so how do you actually navigate those data sources are increasingly diverse so how do you actually integrate it's so much rubbish out there so how do you authenticate and then the most challenging one at all is how do you differentiate how can you reliably begin to make a critical assessment your perceived career trajectory is not going to be subject to replacement by robotics or automated clinical decision software at some point within the foreseeable future I think you'd agree these are importance in questions to be followed and then of course in the broader elements of this the whole issue of privacy and surveillance and the other issues which follow here are all part of the debate on the unfolding of deep learning machine intelligence and artificial intelligence and for any of you want to make a foray into this I think these are probably the three most important and sophisticated and scholarly volumes which have been published on this in offering the pros and cons of this and if any of you are interested is also the OST B study on preparing for a future of artificial intelligence it's probably the most superficial before but nonetheless is a good introduction to the subject and although we've not touched on it today it has relationship to precision medicine which is the question of how far does the elucidation of biological mechanism which is the research side of the circle is that driving us towards a new capacity to modify organisms including ourselves so clearly the nature cover CRISPR everywhere but much more importantly a whole field of synthetic biology gene therapy cell therapy the type of work that's being done in terms of trying to trade Xena grafts for transplantation by modulation of genomes of pigs and perhaps most profoundly of all which stimulated the National Academy meetings shown there at the bottom right with daily Baltimore the behavior of the actions of the Chinese in applying CRISPR technology to modify genomes in newly fertilized embryo albeit one that could not be implanted but I think one of the most profound questions alone we spent some time with girls group this morning talking about this I don't have an answer to this but right now we've all spent our lives in the world which has been dominated by hypothesis generation as opposed to mining of large cow datasets is that gonna flip such that hypothesis driven research will become very much secondary to mining a very large go datasets so a new skill set the data scientists a new skill set for perhaps for sophisticated automated systems I don't know the answer to that but I poses the question but one thing is sure it's moving at a helical pace I mean that's really that's what we're trying to show here so I think if you look at this in the context of medical education clearly much of our contemporary curriculum is still appropriate grounded in the intellectual pedigree of Flexner at the start of the 20th century converting medicine at least then to a science centric discipline from 2000 onwards we saw Curtis Lee who then Institute of Medicine now the national academy of medicine healthcare is a learning system now we've moved into a world in which network topologies and dynamics become the critical factor whether it be at the level of the analysis of disease shown here is the genome challenge but equally important health care systems are in their own right complex adaptive systems motor multiplicity of organizational entities having to be put in place so you've got this duality of the research dimension that we're all involved in together with the health care delivery system both of which represent profound complexity this is a cover from the cover of Jarmo in December and I think it's a rather savage concern at one level about what is going to be the future of medicine and medical education is it uh is it bashyam as opposed to trumpian but passion in terms of is this really the nightmare that medical education faces for the future courtesy of all the sorts of things that I've been talking about I think that this is an appropriate metaphor at another level but I would argue that it's as much this to a new definition of DNR is not do not resuscitate it is denial negativity and resistance so those embedded cultural parameters will be as important in influencing the trajectory of the evolution of precision medicine into the clinic as anything else so in summary clearly but the intellectual level precision medicine ashes in a new era in clinical medicine and public health it will it has an obligate and inextricable linkage and interdependence you with data intensive medicine and digital healthcare but those dualities carry profound implications as shown there in that bottom bullet but it is in the end a systems-based approach the world our discovery in translational science in which most of us live how do we move this into new clinical trial designs driven by precision medicine perhaps we can talk about in QA that is also requiring new paradigms for regulators and payers and the final issue of course is how do we ensure that this moves into clinical care for the benefit of patients because we're dealing with a classic convergence on than here on the one side we've got consumerism in terms of patient engagement social media lifestyle style and expanding care space beyond healthcare on the other hand the world in which we all live science technology and medicine on the other side but all this comes together in terms of Big Data population health precision medicine how do we apply data science to manage these massive data flows and eventually the role of artificial intelligence in it so for a cold Michigan day some of us I hope this is not too inflammatory a comment will be going home to sunshine and 75 degrees but you know it has been a great honor to give a lecture in your name sir so I hope that least even though this is a fairly superficial surfer cross a broad range of subject matter I hope at least it is illustrating some of the factors which are influencing the trajectory of precision medicine as at least as I would perceive them so thank you very much George a big subject big future big data wonderful slides questions Gary they direct a couple quick things this morning what I perceive is happening in a lot of science and I hate to say this being a faculty member in computational medicine bioinformatics but sort of a really over focus on reductionist algorithmic and computational approaches without giving scant regard to kind of intuitive you know human-like approaches and this I also see this in the literature all time although I do a lot of computational biology I see a lot of they werethe medical errors a lot of statistical errors and articles I read you know I don't really know what to do with that that is a great concern that was one of the circles I think on one of your slides you have well moving towards this era computational medicine Nichola the other quick thing and we talked about this having worked at asher x the nightmare was health insurance companies would never actually act on their word they would say they would pay us for these tests a million versus and the whole strategy is to deny deny deny until that denial became too costly for them and they had to act and that's a cultural thing and how do we get it with that I know it's a lot to ask and one question no and embedded in all of them a whole series of by definition multi-dimensional challenges but I think trying to take them sequentially I think the I push back against the simplistic reductionism at the level of belief so the two dimensions to it but first is the obsession with the belief that genome sequencing is going to solve everything that's the first pushback the second is reductionism in the relation to the fact we're going to take humans out of the loop and again we had a very interesting conversation on that this morning I don't know as to what the dynamics of that removal of human from the loop is going to be I think we already see certainly some of the large-scale systems which the military are operating the human is already out of the loop by definition taking that quote intuitive I mean one of the interesting no but but sort of you appropriately use the word intuitive with the assumption that only humans can be intuitive there were some there are some in the artificial intelligence community who believe that that that that capacity will eventually be replicated at some point I don't know enough to know whether or not that's reality but the oh and your point then about the question of which is a subset of the larger data reproducibility replication issue flawed statistical methodologies particularly being generated by people like myself because we've often said with humor and reason most of us do biology medicines because we didn't have to do math I so the question of statistical sophistication is going to reach entirely new levels I mean in clinical trials we can get to talking about everything shifting to Bayesian type designs very few people including myself really understand the nuances of that but I think that there's a very interest in school of thought that argues of naturally statistical error and bias introduced by human-in-the-loop today will be automatically refereed by computational tools that say AHA that's a flawed statistical methodology as to the final point on the perversity of the players which i think is an appropriate characterization for the most part and I think in the context of molecular diagnostics as we discuss this point is potentially an existential threat to the viability of molecular diagnostic companies at this stage which of course given the fact of the whole edifice of precision medicine at least from the research side is going to be rested upon robust robust analytical assays to subset your patients into ever smaller populations particularly from the standpoint of therapeutic selection I think we're going to have to wait as you said until the straw that breaks the camel's back in a cost structure and I think that's here and it's called a pneumo oncology and that is the fact that when you're now looking at people putting together like ctla4 inhibitors and pd1 pro-1 inhibitors together at a combination of $300,000 a pop with only 30 to 40% of patients responding that is going to be when the well-known material is going to hit the fan in terms of them beginning I think once that begins to be demonstrated that that is a constraint that forget therapeutic non adherence by patients literally every drug class carries at least a 20 to 30 percent non-responder fraction even when drugs are taken in impeccable appearance with the prescription patent so I think that I look to immuno oncology as actually a cost driver which is actually going to force a much more stringent analysis respondent normally spawn the phenotyping does that answer your question okay students students get priority here any questions from students re - which of you had as you have said there are to some extent existential threats my question is what is the alternative it's the combination of barriers and and inhibiting factors that you've identified to some extent overwhelms all the attempts at progress that are being made so that this transformation doesn't happen what what's the alternative what would that look like again it is such a multi-dimensional question I don't think anyone has any simple answers whether it be attempts under the Affordable Care Act or what we may see come under the replace and repeal dimension none of us really know that one thing is very clear nothing in the Affordable Care Act yet alone any ambiguities yet to come in the repeal and replace dimension deal with this fundamental imbalance between infinite demand and finite resource I think we have to make a very stark judgment which at one level is subjective and I recognize there are significant cultural differences here Europe has been far better even though it would seem on the surface to be punitive in applying much harsher pharmacal metrics because it sorry pharmacological econometrics in terms of end points like quality adjusted life years in terms everyone know what that is okay so the quality dimension yes you can it if it were introduced into the debate here in the US it would be death panels pushing granny off the cliff all of the other crap that we hear when we time debate anything seriously but we will have to go there we cannot go on in this way and if you do if you do a cost effective analysis there is not a single drug that has been introduced since 2002 in oncology which will hit the quality parameter which is used in Europe to deny something going on to the formula and we are tragically gonna have to start facing up to the fact that there's and we again getting back to this issue of which we flirted with today in some of the more scientific discussions what is the probability that that the disruption of complex signaling networks in chronic late onset diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's and other degenerative neuropathies that a single point of intervention drug is actually gonna reset that network back to some measure of homeostatic stability all of us would say nil right and unfortunately that's reflected in clinical trials we've just seen the latest in the Lilly failure in house on his disease and at some point we're gonna have to basically and I think it's an ethical issue begin to say that you know it but you raised a very good point do we just stop everything the answer is no but I think we have to be much more pragmatic in saying we've been down this Avenue and it is not working it is time to rethink it and in addition we've got to reach a point with certain late onset diseases I mean ASCO the American side of the clinical oncology is already wrestling with the issue is at what point do you begin to transition to palliative care how many interventions you have to go through before you actually say just on quality of life issues and I don't know that no one knows it's an individual choice of one level and no one knows what would they will do until the awful diagnosis is given to them but standing here today hopefully in reasonable health I know if that diagnosis is given to me I'm growing my beard in my ponytail and I'm not going to have that type of multiple assault subjected on me knowing that the probability of outcome is so miserable but that's that's an individual judgment which everyone has to make but sooner or later society's going to have to make that judgment to see a chart thanks I'm just a follow up on in society and cultural and ethical differences that you just mentioned so there is also a question that many advances in science and technology and that you should of Durst's they are not widely public that you miss the gap before you with icons yeah so it's not that widely accepted it's not understood which is okay but the results many Center figures are not accepted by the public you can see it with the GMOs vaccinations people for a lack official who don't believe in climate change so can you comment on that what are possible ways and what are our responsibilities as a community of scientists to you know change that because without that it will be very hard to change the policies advance towards the things that you've already mentioned there you're absolutely right I mean as we get into dangerously what is closely under this election being called the post act world right yet alone me orchestrated deceptive fake news in its own right but even if you stay within objective data the ability of the public apparently the other assimilate that I mean you can at least generously concede in the climate change you'd think that that seems to be so far after people but they have difficulty in their heads around it but GMOs and vaccinations and sorry we can't treat grandma those are going to be issues which are in in our face today is immediate issues and I don't I don't know how you do that in a society that has not only got this is the us society which I've been privileged to live for forty years is that another level the most cocoon Society has lost all perspective risk benefit in its analysis and is an entitlement society not at a level of as the politicians with all that entitlement it is the fact that we are a No Limit society but you mean there is a drug available or I can't have a third cycle of chemo I mean I don't know what the answers of this is but regretfully we are going to have these issues in our face and I think for you as the next generation are going to be dealing with them in a far more acute blade and I have to because I can just go off and hide the your the the power of your advocacy in getting these issues across becomes ever more important because to some extent my generation has not done a good enough job in preparing society and in that sense most importantly preparing the legislature to understand the complexities issues but on the other hand looked at the look at where are the anti-vaccination issues most profound what's the most affluent county in the United States that has the highest low vaccination rate so Marin County Marin with oranges and farther behind survey of the Stanford graduating medical class the medical school class forty percent believed they didn't think that vaccination was safe right you know I mean if you want to searing pain in the temple at any time you know think think about that if we in advanced tertiary education could not create a cogent compelling case and how the hell can we expect you know Joe Blow to accept it but I think we just have to engage I'm not giving you a meaningful answer but I think we have to stay the course and recognize that the the complexity of these issues he's just going to continue to escalate yes so in many ways it's it's easier to prevent a cancer case than to treat the cancer case right and I think as a society where we're spending a lot of money to find new treatments and less money to prevent more thing so what are your thoughts on in the future shifting that balance and having more precision prevention two precision treatments well again the much lurks within the question I mean but at the highest level by definition you're absolutely correct in terms of a preventive strategy so can we now identify which cohorts are the greatest list to apply the preventive methods if we're looking at in the population at large we've seen this in the past and Gil certainly knows this better than anyone who is going to basically undertake the clinical trial that may require 30 to 40 years for intervention acts or intervention why in my opinion that's what that's what enlightened public health should be doing but there are so many variables that get thrown into that so even if you believed that you had and he so not just staying within therapeutics but a behavioral adjustment I I just don't think it's going to occur I think we've seen I mean smoking is clearly a success story at one land when so far as the numbers undoubtedly drop but you look at other elements of lifestyle I'm not sure that we really modulated our predisposition factors in any way and if we modulated them the cardiovascular disease we certainly haven't modulated them in relation to diabesity he said packing pad in his tummy right you know there is a great example marine that was conducted on a national scale in Taiwan if you consider natural from hepatitis B associated liver cancer and this was a study organized by a single scientist with many colleagues he was University of Washington epidemiology and physician faculty member my family when I was Dean of public health there who went to Taiwan for a sabbatical and stayed on focused his work on hepatitis B prevention and the seminal recognition that liver cancers resulted in people who were infected during birth and the neonates who became chronic carriers often with no manifestation clinically of the hepatitis were the future cases of an epidemic of liver cancer in their country so they managed to put through get enough evidence persuade the powers-that-be and the population for universal immunization at prenatal period and they have eliminated and this is now that decades later they've eliminated cases and that whole cohort of liver cancer related to hepatitis B that's the kind of big thinking yeah we need to stimulate and of course planet discoveries that support such decisions and by by definition acute events which have an obvious Public Registry and then you go back to polio right it was very easy to get a societal mobilization behind we must have a vaccine we must have a vaccine because it was the swimming pools of summer and the presence in your face problem when when the problem is long distant particularly without a causal association or even a correlative association it's very much more difficult for agencies to respond but we also have to ask some very profound questions which didn't come up here is what what are the front what are what is the responsibility of governments to be undertaking these far more sophisticated long-term perspectives because the following is a provocative statement do we have the National Institutes of Health or do we actually have the National Institutes of biomedical research right yeah but I mean there's much that lurks there I mean 80% of the NIH thirty-five billion dollar budget goes to what ro1 grants right and what's the average size of an ro1 grant $380,000 unlike anyway did meaning ro1 grants because they're damn difficult to get but it is not the way we should be organizing biomedical research today but the minute you wanted to flip-flop this to other issues the Howell that would go up from where right here and every other University campus I mean I will make an inflammatory comment that the ro1 grants for the most part have become a form of academic welfare they contribute very little in in isolation in aggregation yes but we've got to seriously rethink the over way in which we approach societal problems at large hugs that's the guy let me jump in here for a second hand it to dr. states um you know Maureen you're your leader and human papillomavirus research now and some of the things that are on the you know therapeutic and treatment side certainly on the identification side and you know some of us have to just rebalance our own energies yeah and especially because we have credibility and get out there and make people aware that we can do it make a difference that our kids can you know benefit from this and that we do have some means available so I just want to jump in there because it's incumbent on all of us if this bill is encouraging us to to you know take this on and educate not only ourselves and our students but society you know and I think you're in a position to do that in that case and it could make it huge but although we didn't get into it today this is not quite the same question you asked but we did touch on it just will be a lot of topics somewhat superficially but if precision medicine as practiced in terms of identification of subsets of subpopulations of disease and the ability to have targeted therapeutics against that sub population we've got to think about entirely new clinical trial designs right because you can't have large-scale randomized clinical trials because you can't get enough patients for many of the subsets are talking about but then the whole issue which is under discussion right now is can you in fact create hybrid trials where you in fact forego phase 3 and move it into registration on the basis of demonstrating proof of concept namely efficacy gross toxicity will clearly be revealed in one phase one or phase two but those drugs will be abandoned anyway the safety issues that plague us are the one in 100,000 one in 500,000 which only show up after a drug is approved anyway so the issue then of creating streamline clinical trials where you can submit for registration at the end of Phase two with having demonstrated efficacy and obviously you reasonably statistically powered cohort but then you then get coverage with evidence development such that you make a commitment as a company that you will do a larger study but in their interim that drug is available for patients earlier you'll get him reimbursement for that drug and if you have to agree to a fixed timeline for that post approval review if you complete on time and it demonstrates what was demonstrated in the earlier study you stay on the market and if you can't demonstrate that efficacy you come off the market then another element is the whole issue of indication based pricing so we are seeing this in cancer so if you get approval for malignancy a and this is your price for it and then you get approval for malignancy B and C that will be indexed against malignancy a if the overall survival time in malignancy B is greater than malignancy a you'll get a premium on the price of a and if it is less in malignancy see you'll get a Deckard proportional decrement relative to that initial approval all these sorts of things are going to have to be thrashed is it sorry okay as a former academic who's now a Pharma guy there's a lot I like about what you're describing but I will caution that where precision medicine is now it's kind of the Internet 1.0 it's look at all these cool things we can do where health care is is the internet 2017 it's a wonderful powerful world but it's a dangerous world filled with lots of bad actors and one of the responsibilities of people in this room is actually figuring out ways to sort out what's good data what's bad data I'm encouraged to see the University of Washington offering a recognizing big data course but right now and I think it's you know paraphrasing what you just said that comes back to my two circles there's the smaller circle of research momentum in terms of molecular classification and disease but the bigger circle where we can extract so that's your internet one but the internet 2017 is in fact the big healthcare circle but as you say it isn't even even if we observe avoid the bad actors avoiding the bad data is really the issue next one hi this was actually a sort of reaction to your comment a little while back about NIH grants so it seems to me that a lot of what you were talking about was massive labor shortage need for an economic restructuring within the medical system which means either math training mass retraining of individuals to be able to handle large-scale data in relationship to medicine and so this made me think about my cohort of biologists so we were trained that the funding to train us was sort of brought large-scale at the beginning of 2000's with the idea that biotechnology was the future economy of the United States and then by the time everyone was trained it turned out no we had over produced biologists right and so this client it's like one in ten PhDs in biology go on to get that sort of standard tenure track job but they thought that they were being trained is there any mass effort at this point to retrain those people for these jobs that are predicted to come online it's a sophisticated and profound question take the last part first I'm not aware of any mass retraining but but there was a there was a subtlety and I hope you won't do my responses inflammatory when you said training for tenure-track positions that's part of the problem if we tell people that the only Avenue for the use of your intellectual creativity is go tenure track we're doing something fundamentally wrong because there's such a swath of careers that can be pursued if you've got expertise in biomedicine so a little bit of a push back now that you per se but but I think that looking for the future I think we've got I don't think we can retrain because this is an issue buying life ultimate it is the question of is it easier to take people from hardcore math statistics and data science and teach them some biology as opposed to going the other way I I think that for the most part it against a personal opinion it's much more difficult for people in biomedicine to really gain the sophisticated ability going the other way than that way but where I think there is a huge gap is this whole issue of whatever you want to call it data science the learning machine intelligence artificial intelligence we have a huge gap of that not only in biomedicine but if we train people in those disciplines even if we can't assimilate them into biomedicine because we're saturated there's so many other places in which the data deluge is occurring they will be employable anywhere so I think you thank you do it and you thank everybody wait please come just a few steps down the hall to the poster session have a little refreshment and meet the students and postdocs who are presenting I'm Gill Gill if you could just remind people if they want the slides are on my website and if we wanted to take Kinnear slides that George welcomes you to look at them or use them without tribution from his website
