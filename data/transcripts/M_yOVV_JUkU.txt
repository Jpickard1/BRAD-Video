and one of his main publications many many publications he and his wife developed the blosum matrix i I just want to tell you that I learned this fact idea after I moved from from from Seattle and and it was one of the great discovered computational tools I will say that blossom substitute blocked substitution matrix again without a doubt he's a true computational biologist dr. Hannah Cole and please give give a warm welcome to dr. Hannah cope as he discussed his latest work the epigenome epigenomic landscape at the base pair resolution thank you so much dr. Niccole okay well thank you India for the kind introduction and for the invitation to come here and today about some of our recent work I'll be talking about the epigenome there's been a lot of excitement about it I would define the epigenome as DNA 13 complex that complexes that package our chromosomes that package our genomes now there's the mapping the the methods that people been used for have been using for mapping the epigenome however have given us only a rather static view of the situation and we've been interested in dynamics and so I'm going to focus try to focus on the dynamics today and I'm going to begin with the dynamic situation in which the transcriptional apparatus impacts the nucleus um so what happens there and then I'm going to move on to a more general way that we'd come up with remapping the epigenome dynamics and I'm going to end with the least dynamic region of the chromosome and that's a centromere something that's been a long term interest of ours okay now we're going to start out with the nucleosome and it's shown here as the sphere but that's not an atomic correct rather the nucleosome core looks like this you have a tight left-handed spiral of proteins that the DNA simply follows around and there is a central disc of histones three and four that's flanked above and below by dimers of h2a and h2b now the bulk of nucleosomes are deposited behind the replication fork so they go in for newly synthesized DNA but there's a set of histone variants that a replication independent in their assembly so they go and fit already from the nice template and if we consider those that are universal or nearly so therefore two of them are histone three variants in two or h-2a variants now to replace h-2a with let's say h2 AZ you have to partially unravel the nucleosome to make the exchange but h3 is in the middle and to replace it with h 3.3 you have to unravel the nucleosome at least half way essentially evict the core in order to get to h 3.3 in there and therefore we realized that we could gain a glimpse into nucleus own dynamics by profiling h 3.3 now we've done that in drosophila for example this shows a gene rich region the map of a gene rich region of the fly genome and we see these h 3.3 patters now it turns out where h 3.3 is high such as here that turns out to correspond four sites primarily of sites of active transcription where the more transcription the more h 3.3 gets in so what that implies is that when RNA polymerase goes through a nucleosome it disrupts it in such a way that sometimes you lose a nucleus some of that allow h 3.3 to get in now that gives us a steady-state view of the dynamics and we wanted to actually measure the dynamics the kinetics directly and to do that we came up with a metabolic labeling approach we use an analogue from the finding that goes into all proteins with meth I mean and has an azide group on it now we can derivatized that azide with an alkyne in this case linked to biotin such that we label all newly synthesized proteins with biotin now we're interested in the DNA that wraps around the nucleosome core so we extract chromatin in the usual way I'll talk more about that later then we watched stringently to remove the h-2a h-2b dimers and this will also pretty much strip off all of the bound proteins such as transcription factors in life and then we can do struck down and pull down or the newly synthesized h3 h4 particles we call this enough to catch it it was work of Roger deal when he was a postdoc in the lab and what you'll notice here is that the captured profile after brief incorporation period looks a lot like the h3 point 3 profile which confirms our assertion that a CH 3 point 3 Maps that they've some dynamics because when we nuclear some turnover because when we look at turnover directly we see similar patterns now the relationship between transcription and turnover is correlated in this case and we wanted to have some more direct evidence that actually transcription drives turnover and to do that Sheila covets in the lab follow look at the region of the drosophila genome where there are three hsp70 heat shock genes and what you see here is what happens when we profile using chromatin immunoprecipitation a method i'll talk a lot more about later of RNA polymerase 2 and what you see here are these Peaks 30 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site this is the promoter proximately paused polymerase first shown by jonlizz and then when we see when we heat shock what we see is the gene bodies now fill up with pol ii because there's immediate rapid transcription a release of pol ii going going through genes and if we look at turnover what we see is that the gene bodies now show a dramatic increase in turnover so indeed this implies that active transcription drives nucleosome turnover but we want to learn more about this like what is it about transcription that is responsible for the turnover and our attention fell on portion goes like this think of DNA as being twisted in the right-handed manner so it's positively twisted RNA polymerase has to melt my pen base pairs of DNA in order to start laying down the bases then they'll start moving forward when it moves forward think of it like a plumber's auger is forcing forcing positive portion downstream negative torsion upstream this is a so-called twin super coil domain model that's been out there for a long time now the DNA that wraps around the nucleosome core I mentioned was left-handed so the positive torsion would tend to unwrap the nucleosome so we guessed that maybe torsion might be involved in it so how do you measure torsion so what we use is a compound that others have used trimethylsilyl n which interpolates between the bases and when you hit with UV light it will cause a cross-linked of the strands and then Sheila came up with a method where we can precisely map the cross-linked and that'll tell us how much my methyl psoralen goes in now when DNA is under twisted more tri methyl psoralen again and when it's over twist that less will get in so we can use this as a proxy for the torsion and we can map it and this is what we see if we line up all the genes that the five prime ends there em at their three prime ends and show the average the genome-wide average is the dotted line and what we see is that upstream and downstream of the gene we see an increase in negative torsion and over gene bodies we see positive portion and so that's the hypothesis of what we're looking at here so tests that we use an inhibitor topoisomerase one now couple one acts as a swivel to relieve the tort and so when we inhibit it we would expect to see increases in portion of both directions and that's what we see so we see that there's an increase of negative torsion upstream and downstream and increase in positive portion over the gene body and that confirms the twin super coil domain model now what about turnover so we measured catch it incorporation the catch it use the casted method to measure turnover and what you see here is that we're positive torsion increases we're seeing more turnover or negative torsion increases we're seeing less turnover and we see this not only for topoisomerase 1 which act as a swivel but also for topoisomerase 2 which carries out a breakage and pass through reaction so if we it relaxes the port that relieves the torsion in a very different way but we see basically the same the same kind of result so what this implies is that when polymerase goes through it forces positive torsion that he stabilizes nucleus on downstream and stabilizes them up during something bill guerrard it actually shown in yeast and unser pricasso long time ago but we're seeing this in general over over the cassava genome ok so far we've been focused on the nucleus zone what's happening to the nucleus on from the nucleus on perspective I'm going to change the perspective now to that of RNA polymerase so what happens when transcription goes through a nucleus on what happens to the plumbers now in order to answer this question Chris Weber when he was registered in the lab needed to come up with a way of first of all mapping RNA polymerase at very high resolution ideally at base resolution and also be able to measure all RNA polymerase is because because what happens is when RNA polymerase it's an impediment such as you might expect when it hits a nucleus on by the way RNA polymerase in vitro can't get through nuclear some at all it will backtrack and when a bap tracks the three prime end will actually come out and it'll come off track and you and so the methods that are out there aren't really good for mapping that because they'll only map be engaged when we so I needed something get off all RNA polymerase is the problem with doing things like chip is that RNA polymerase is very insoluble but then Chris realized well maybe he could use the insolubility to purify the polymerase and so that's what he did and it's very simple idea and that is we use a method that's been out there for over 20 years we release a cytoplasm nucleoplasm and wash the chromatin pellet and all the engaged RNA polymerase will be there so we'll have both the Allen gating and the ones that have hit the hit the barium backtrack so we'll get all of those in the in the in the pellet and this just shows that we get quantitative recovery and this is of the Ellen gating RNA polymerase it's all in the pellet essentially and then we apply a published method for sequencing the three prime end of the nascent transcript we call this three prime NT and it's trans-pacific and here's what we see over a over a representative region of the Drosophila genome what you're looking at here are these spikes so here is an intron here's an exon and you'll notice that the density the spikes is very similar in introns and exons that's what you'd expect if what we're measuring is the base that's being added on to the growing chain of RNA in the active site of RNA polymerase so this is the ultimate map of transcription all the processing events happening after this now well we want to know is where these spikes relative to the nucleus on landscape so we can map the nuclear some landscape using M&A seek I'll say more about that we digest the unprotected DNA would you pair it in sequencing and it gives us an earth with some landscape that looks like this shown here on both strand so then the question is where are the spikes relative to the nucleosomal Peaks there's just a blow-up and so the question is where is this spike for example relative to the diet axis of the plus one nucleus um so what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to use a coordinate system based on the plus one nuclear some line up all the Drosophila genes at their plus one nucleus um and then we'll rank order them by the amount of three prime n T signal the amount of paltu that we see and it looks like this so here's the heat map representation and what you'll first notice is that the vast majority of the stalls occur 73 base pairs upstream the entry site of the nucleus tone you'll also see that the ones with the most pile to turn out to be the promote approximately pause polymerase is that I've pointed out earlier cuz they're there at plus 30 but it turns out that when we when we separate those out and look they also will stall when they hit the entry site so this is a housekeeping process essentially all RNA polymerase will stall to some extent when they hit the entry site of of the nucleus out now there's just another representation of what I just showed you so here is the profile of all of the +1 nucleosomes and here is the stall density and you see if at the entry site here when we go to +2 we also see a peak at the same place and when we go to gene body nucleosomes are there in we also see stall here but we see some encroachment into the into the nucleus own if we ask where this may have found the nucleosome itself what we see is that there's some encroachment so RNA polymerase the active site about 15 to 20 base pairs from the from the front of the polymerase as it's going through and so what we see is that it's actually starting to unwrap the nucleosome when it gets in and that's happening that's happening at all essentially all nucleus on what's striking about this is that that's not where it's been mapped in vitro there are many studies showing that that in vitro install is somewhere else well I told you in vitro can't get through you have to add something else to get in there but in vivo it's a very different place our interpretation is that this is where the histone DNA contacts are the strongest and that's why you've seen in vitro but in vivo there's a lot out there's a lot going on there that's allowing RNA polymerase to get through this barrier and what might that be we first look at the magnitude of the stall and we see the +1 nucleosome shows the biggest all the other stalls are remarkably uniform about my much lower now we realize that the post one nucleus um is special in a number of ways and from our perspective the most interesting difference is the +1 nuclear some is really loaded with that histone variant that I mentioned very beginning called h 2 h z o h 2 AZ is universal is is universally found it's always it's always it's been a puzzle as to what it actually does but finding this kind of situation we wondered where there h 2 AZ is involved in this housekeeping process of stalling so first thing we did was the map h 2 h the occupancy and what we noticed was if we plot the occupancy as a function of the stalling there anti-correlated as if h 2 AZ is acting to reduce the stall to test that we knocked down h 2 AZ and we measured the 3 prime n 3 signal and the remaining HQ is e and we divided up nucleosomes into whether there's no change in stalling upon knock down or increased stalling con knock down and what you see 4 + 1 + 2 + green body nucleosomes is that where there's increased stalling upon knockdown we see less h uaz which confirms that h2 AZ is really reducing the nucleosome barrier because where there's less of it you get more stalling so what this first of all implies is that actually h2 AZ has evolved to reduce the stall and that could be in general what so the stall is a big problem for RNA polymerase to get through in HQ AZ is evolved to reduce that what it doesn't explain is why is there a stall in the first place I mean why isn't that that the plus one why should it be different from the others and I could only speculate on that but here's the way we're thinking of it if you go back to the data I showed you previously about torsion we see that the plus one nucleus um is different from the others downstream and that it doesn't respond to torsion in other words there's no we don't see any we don't see any increased turnover when we increase the portion by inhibiting the cuff up and so what we infer from this is that the plus one nucleosome is inherently resistant to getting removed by caution now think of the torsion as being the tool that Paul through uses to get the nucleus ohm out of the way but they can't build up enough of how to steam in order to actually get that plus one nucleus um it's sort of the physics of the situations that it just it that's the best that can do so needs something like h2 AZ to make the nucleosome come off more easily would be one thing but we also think that the fact that nuclear submarine Marvel's histone modifications of a particular types I tend to be loaded over that plus one nuclear so we see that as an adaptation for allowing pal to to get through the to get through that plus one nucleus on now but I'd like to turn to so that's that's one kind of dynamics of dynamics between RNA polymerase and the and the nuclear so now what I'm going to turn to our is I'm going to turn to methods for looking at other components of the epigenome where we can eventually will eventually get to the dynamic but first I want to introduce you to actually an enzyme that's going to be our favorite tool for doing this and it's called micro taco now those of you who know by chromatin work will be familiar with my protocol nuclease because it's been used for decades for mapping nucleosomes now M&A is a single strand specific secreted glycoprotein now you might wonder well how the Klee double strand well we're not actually sure but but what we think happens in DNA breathes a little bit allows em and asically one strand making the easier to cleave the other strand and then a nibble on the ends and pillo reaches an impediment such as a nuclear Sun core particle and that's what that's why people use a use that for mapping nucleus um but we realize that emanates would probably stop nibbling anytime it hits a DNA binding protein so that we modified the Illumina protocol for paired-end sequencing such that we could recover fragments that were 25 base pairs or more and then we would just map and stack three real simple and this is a represented region of the yeast genome and intergenic region and this shows an M&A series where all we're mapping are the smaller fragments the larger fragments tell us where the nucleosomes are so you see these things nucleus owns down here now the smaller fragments we see this whittling down of what looked us like maybe three particles they're close to one another each of context about 30 base pairs and they show different occupancy now this is a general method we've applied it for example to Drosophila and when we looked at the small the small fragments and do the mapping and stacking the reads and look at that hsp70 region I showed you previously we see that there are the squarish Peaks there this one corresponds the Gaga factor this one corresponds to Tata binding protein from previous work we knew that they were there so we have a very nice method for profiling the epigenome in general now we realized that we get the same profile if we extract the DNA immediately after the emanates digestion or extract the soluble comic and then extract the DNA from that and we realized that we could use this soluble chromatin as the input for chromatin immunoprecipitation just by pulling it down with an antibody for a particular let's say transcription factor so I'm going to illustrate this strategy using a transcription factor from yeast called rev 1 now rev 1 have been mapped by Rick Young's group over a dozen years ago using cross-linking and sonication so called X chip and the readout was on microarrays and then that was followed by calling motifs using standard method and that could identify site specific sites in the genome and this is just a representative region showing that there are two sites using this method of Rev one occupancy now a big improvement to this protocol came from Frank you basically resected back with an exonuclease get high resolution and low background and this allowed him to do many to find many more Peaks and it's quite it was quantitative and in addition he didn't need to use the motif calls because the peaks were sharp enough okay so we wondered how this simple method that I just described where we pull down from the soluble I scramble and how this would bear against it so what we do is we we call this organic for occupied regions and denote so infinity peers by naturally isolated chromatin the idea of the Afrin 'm is that we're not adding any any Crossley any toxic compounds such as formaldehyde and when we map the small fragments here the this is this is the raw data you're looking at here we we get pretty much the same peaks you get with chip EXO and then some we get a lot more peaks and if we use the mean use the the mean program to basically identify to identify the motifs that are represented by the peak calls we see we get the same one motif in both cases now it's worth noting that for organic it's very very specific in the sense that that 99.3% of our peak calls have the motif so it's it's very highly specific much much much more specific than the other methods that we that we use now a limitation that we ran into of this organic method is that when we got into higher you carry when we got an entire eukaryotes when we got into large complexes such as RNA pal - we found that solubility was limitation couldn't we just consolidating only a small part and now worried us so Pete's keying a postdoc in lab came up with the following the following method with high resolution cross-linking chip method so we do female dyed cross-linking in the usual way and then instead of sonication we just do eminates digestion now this is insoluble but with reef sonication we can get it out of solution so CH d1 is perky is a is a nuclear some remodeler that that pete was interested in studying and what he found was that with just brief sonication you go from poor recovery to quantitative the curie of CHD one when we applied this to RNA pol 2 which I told you was it was terribly insoluble what we basically see is that we get a result that really nicely corresponds to 3 prime NT where we've mapped us Eisley where RNA pol is so this seems to work if you're wondering about what's wrong with conventional and em chip X chip you're basically seeing it over the over the transcriptional start site we think that's a we think that's a sonication artifact so one of the just just be aware that that as usually practice that chip has has some issues but it looks like this high resolution and X gypsy was pretty well so we applied it the transcription factor in this case CTC up so we can compare with other data this is from human of human cells and you see compared to the encode profile which is kind of broad we get a very nice sharp peak here that's right over TCF monkey also compares very favorably with excel so this is another another nice method but in both cases of these these new methods it's giving us a static picture and we really want to know about the dynamics the dynamics of transcription factors and for that we've abandoned ship and we've come up with with a different approach now I'd like to say this as new but it's not this is something that was published by early Laemmle over 10 years ago and he calls a chromatin endogenous cleavage and it goes like this and we just added a sequencing readout everything else came from Laemmle so we make a fusion between our chromatin protein of interest our transcription factor and micro-tyco nucleus now my kakaako nucleus is entirely dependent on calcium and intracellularly there's very low calcium that's true for yeast that true for us and so all we need to do is permeable eyes the cell to add calcium and just wait while the M&A starts to cleave it's already bound if it's a transcription factor that we simply purify the DNA we use an amp your beat selection step very simple to enrich or small fragments and we make libraries in other words we take cells that are alive we add calcium and a few moments later we extract the DNA we make libraries that's it advantages include its in vivo cells are live there's no Chrome from solubalization no antibodies no fractionation this is very much like a method that basta and st. saw when he was a postdoc in my lab came up with called the mid-40s damn methylates but in this case we're making the we're using emanates itself and the advantage over DM ID is that first of all to control exquisitely by calcium and as I'll show you we can get an ear base pair resolution here it is for for Reb one and this is work at Gabe's enter a postdoc in lab now this is a red one motif on the opposite strand from what I showed you before and we're doing paradin sequencing so we get the cleavages on the left end and the right end independently with no calcium we see this this background here now 10 seconds later after calcium addition we see dramatic cleavage this for all 2,000 verb 1 sites we see dramatic cleavage on both strands so you get double-stranded cleavage over here now 20 second so we get orientation you might notice it turns out that this is what we see if we put emanates on the c-terminus been put on an interim if it actually pleads on both sides now 20 seconds now we see a difference so what we're what we're seeing is the beginning of the nibbling and now you see these sharp Peaks 30 40 50 one minute and you can see that the piece move closer and closer killer within maybe a base there or two of the red one motif now if we go longer what happens is that everything begins to drop down as if what's happening is the the transcription factor is actually releasing the DNA and then it keeps going down and out for 20 minute here's a here's an animation of this what I just showed you so you can see the double strand cleavage is the nibbling it goes up and it goes away now how do we analyze data like this so what we what we did was to pull all the time points and do the peak calls on cool time point what we found was is we got a lot more peaks than if we just looked at just a short time point and we realized that these might fall into two categories so we just did clustering k-means clustering k equals 2 basically knows what you see so we have one category which is the fast site and they peak at 40 minutes and then they go down to nothing and then we have another group that takes a long time they're very slow at several minutes payouts before we begin to see something and then if we ask who has the motif it's almost entirely the fast sites have the motif the slow sides don't have the motif now this is general we did this with a bee f1 and rap one to other yeast transcription factors and we see the same thing maybe if one quickly good it peaks at 30 seconds and then goes quickly down down our first thought was well the slow said well we know what the fast sites are that same thing we pick up with chip the slow sites though presented a problem what are they and our first thought was well maybe just random background if there was random background then we done first of all so I can tell you that that is very repeatable we get the same sites for the same transcription factor but when we look between transcription factors we find that nearly that the large majority of them are unique so that implies that it that the sites that we're seeing are specific for the transcription factor as if there's some recognition there so let me just give you a model but what we think is going on I think the best sites would be the standard sites where rebbe where the transcription factor is bound and it spends a long enough time there that data can cleave now the slow sites we think are the transcription factor looking for its site so it's probably going by one dimensional diffusion any place within the genome and just kind of scanning along so it never spends enough time and any particular site to really really give it a high probability of cleavage but sometimes it will find something it likes doesn't have the motif but it likes it and it will send it will it will cleave it and I'll cleave it reproducibly and we have some evidence that this place might be the case and just I'll just outline what it is so if we compare non cross-linked to cross-linked like organic the the cross-linking chip so we did that for a BF one where we basically find is that there's not much effect on the fast side but of cross-linking as you might expect if it's always there however the cross-linking increases the frequency of slow sites and also increases the frequency of random sites so it suggests to us that we're getting time rate so we're getting time resolved mapping a base pair resolution of the transcription factor bound to its site but we're also detecting this scanning process that's that's occurring so we're capturing the dynamics in a way that you can't get with chromatin immunoprecipitation so working on on getting the so we've only done this in yeast but we're trying it out in another organism as far as we know it should it should work just fine but we haven't done that yet okay so I've been talking about dynamic regions about dynamic parts of the chromosome basically where the genes are now I'm going to turn to this this let this the rather static region of the genome the the centromere which is embedded in heterochromatin and nothing much goes on there during the cell cycle until until mitosis and that's where that's where the the centromeres are used that is the centromere is the site of formation of the kinetochore protonation plex that attaches to the microtubule to pull the chromosomes to the pole so it only has one job and that job is out of sync with whatever everything else that's going on when the rest of the chromosome is completely condensed now the the reason that we can vote that we'd like to focus on the centromere is it's long been known that there's a centromere histone variant various we call it's nh3 generically but it's not quite Universal but it's almost universal its ancestral for sure and it's a special centromeric nuclear some very different histone very different from histone h3 from histone needs three point three now and I'll be calling it in we're going to talk about it in yeast and in humans and yeast will call it CSC for the traditional name and in human centromere protein a the traditional name there now we'll start out with yeast and the reason we like to study it in yeast is that it's long been known for some 30 years that yeast centromeres are determined by DNA sequence and it's a fight it was known for 30 years that it's a tripartite sequence variously referred to as referred to as CD 1 2 & 3 now CD 1 is the binding site for the CBF 1 protein c BF 1 it is like Reb 1 a BF 1 rap 1 it's a general DNA binding protein so it binds a lot of other sites and it's non-essential however see the e 3 is the binding site for kinetochore specific complex that is absolutely essential and is needed for localizing the CSE for nucleus own so we can ask where is the CSE for nucleus um you might expect it would be right here over CD 2 and you'd be right so we do organic profiling for all 16 Eve centromeres and this just shows we get a very high dynamic range when we look at the at the ratio and when we go through our MMA series you see that there's a shelf over CD 1 a shelf over CD 3 and you can see that the centromeric nucleus own lies right in the middle in fact depending on how we map this we can show that they're actually three distinct particle here so it's only 80 or so base pairs of DNA that wraps around this particle indicating a single DNA wrap now we wanted to know where this particle how this particle was oriented within this within CD to do that we adopted a method that was introduced by the late John Wyndham John was actually collaborating on this project and when when it got started and what John came up with was a method or turning histone a or into a cleavage reagent a site-specific cleavage reagent and it goes like this in red is serine 47 you change that to assisting you derivatives are with an anthro lean compound that will heal 8a copper and the presence of hydrogen peroxide initiate a strand cleavage reaction and this was modeled by stern of restaurant makan durin who's a postdoc in the lab and he came up with the structural model so the coppers in blue and every kind of comes with and four angstroms of the bond data can cleave you see a dotted line so you can see that their cleavage is on the watson strand and cleavage is on it on the Crick strand and they map like this so this h4 will put these cleavages in there and this age four will put in these cleavages this is predicted and we can compare that with what we see genome-wide in yeast by taking all 60,000 yeast nucleus own and basically deducing where they're where the diet axis is and lining them up and what we see is the cleavage is correspond precisely to what the model says so we think we know how this reagent actually work now this is what you see over the entire chromis chromis on three and we're going to focus our attention on the centromeric region and what we see is that as we get closer and closer to the centromere you can see that there's somewhat you know some sharpness but mostly fuzziness around the centromere we actually see that genome-wide but we see a very distinctive pattern over the CDE two over the centromere think the pattern of cleavages and in fact we can predict we can actually show that the that the patterns over all the centromeres are different than what you see at any other nucleus um so any other nucleus um so they're definitely distinctive when we line up all 16 Yi centromeres what we see is that there are these four Peaks there there's a cluster Peaks there are 10 base pairs apart over here and over here they averaged about three base pairs apart and we can ask how and this is where this aware lies within the the chip signals and I showed you so it's right in there over city to now we can ask how does this fit with models have been proposed for the centromere a nucleus own there's the octa octo merrick model the conventional model also a model in which you don't have h-2a h-2b but you have through each of CSC four and H four and these models don't fit they would predict cleavages in the middle but more importantly there's too much of a rap over here that would be protected to account for this peak here which is too close to the edge of CD 2 CD 2 CD three Junction so these models are incompatible with the data however what is perfectly compatible with data is a model that we'd actually proposed earlier called a half nucleosomal hemi some model and that is that you have a within a population of cells you have equal numbers of these four of these four structures where you have you have two different rotational positions in this orientation and two different rotational positions in the opposite orientation I think that's pretty remarkable if you think about it here we have this asymmetric sequence asymmetric proteins however the orientation of the protein is very flexible within their of the of the complex so that gives us a very fine structure map of the centromeres and and so what we can see is that they're constrained by a single rap and they have DNA binding proteins on both sides sort of holding them in and and allowing this allowing for these these semi sums to form uniquely at this site on the chromosome so then the question is well how well does this hold or other centromeres so we're going to go to to a complex situation and that's the human genome so those of you who are aware the human genome you probably know about this I'm probably aware that the humans you know it's not even close to being completely sequenced because all of our centromeres yet there's no connectivity you have megabit multi megabytes of rays of this homogenious 170 base pair of alpha satellite repeat but there's some structure on the edges in the pure centric region that consists of these repeats but show this very interesting structure so you have monomeric 170 base pair repeats that are quite diverged from from the majority of the Alpha satellite and then you have these higher-order repeats that show this all the young structures let me explain what I mean by that if we look at the X chromosome we find either either edge of the X chromosome we find these 170 base pair repeats present in 12 12 more units and the sequences within the unit are similar to one another but but quite diverged from one another and we go from we can go from distal proximal we find that they get more and more homogeneous as we get closer we and we infer from that that these are older and these are younger because basically these guys have diverged from thee now the question is what's in between well because you can only sequence short short fragments in this case Sanger sequencing of 800 base pairs or so if they're homogeneous you don't know how to how to align them if they're perfectly homogeneous so there's these nearly identical on the assembled repeats in between now some would some have argued that oh well it must be the same thing on the edges is in the middle I that's what you might think for reasons that I can go into in the discussion we don't think that's true and as a result we're very skeptical and so we thought well maybe there's another way that we can get at the human centromeres and that is to use chromatin IP use chip identify the centromere sequence by function so we basically pull it down and now we've got a bag now we've got all these sequences of functional centromere ik sequences and we see we can see if we can make any sense out of it okay that's the idea we do that we first of all do chip this is work a tender a thicker in the lab postdoc and we first pulled down sempai and centromere protein see another one another inner centromere protein and we get the same result for both and this is pretty much as we expected so we see is that there's high density where high density of the centromere proteins where the where the the sequence is fairly homogeneous fairly young and then it kind of poops out as you go in as it diverges because it gets farther and farther away from the sequence and we see that h3 is reduced as you would expect because something is basically taking his place now that's what we expected well we'd be much more interesting would be well what about the what about what doesn't map here what do we get that doesn't map there here's how we did here's how we deal with it so we have hundred base pair reads we can merge them and is the following way so we just we only want those that are that cover a single unit so we need to be confident what the sequence is and so we got everything from 25 base pairs up to 125 base pair now we have when we pull it down we basically get almost entirely alpha satellite that's good but they're diverged anywhere from 100% identical down to 60% again but we don't know so we we basically apply a greedy algorithm that can deal with millions of these of these reads and we just cluster them and we just cluster based on sequence similarity being very stringent we don't want to put anything together that's not really part of a cluster and we get about 200,000 clusters from the human genome that's a lot however it turns out the vast majority of them of single things we don't really care about them we only care about the most abundant ones because those are the ones that we figure are the ones that should dominate human centromere so we rank order them based on the size of the cluster and now we're just going to arbitrarily look at the top 20 and to represent these sequences I just show up by logic and what you see is that there are these four branches now when we use each of these 20 sequences in search genbank what we found was that these two branches correspond to what's been annotated as being part of chromosome 1 and some other chromosome and these two correspond to chromosome 13 and some other chromosomes so we'll call this krunk's on one like and this chromosome 14 line now there were also several unplaced clones and these are the really interesting ones these are the ones where and by the way this is all from the craig Venter genome although we've also done this with with a three four other genomes to basically see the same get the same phylogeny so this is going to be true for the entire for the human genome in general now we we wondered but these unplaced clones so the the basic thought is there unplaced because you could partially assemble them because there's enough divergence there that you can assemble them but they're different enough from what was on the edge of current assemblies that they could be put in there and there were several of them and I'm going to show you the best and now is this one here so if we take number one sequence one the most abundant we see that in maps it'll eleven places with ninety percent average identity number to map to ten places 96 percent etc okay so that's for this branch and it turns out this branch map is right in between so we have you can see this dimeric unit averaged about 95 percent identity now we had a way of checking this time Erik unit and that is that it's well known that there's a protein called centromere protein beefs and B that is a DNA binding protein with exquisite specificity for a 17 base pair for a 17 base pair 15 to 17 base pair binding site and it only binds the centromere as far as we know and it's the only DNA binding protein infant birth and we find this called its MP by it's motif so we find that motif every 340 days beer so we have this very precise time erred unit of the Sun one like consensus now this is these are the most abundant sequences but it turns out it's also abundant another way so we compared the chip abundance within our libraries for everything that has been annotated as out but satellite we find that Sun one like really is the most abundant there accounting for thirty eight point four percent of the total we also analyzed PacBio reads and were able to deduce that that that's a pretty good estimate of the total of the of the total in in the Alpha satellite so this is most abundant sequence and it turns out that 10:13 like is also almost similar very similarly abundant looking back in the literature we found that Exodus was noticed before that there's this time Eric unit that the President on these nine chromosomes and one president on these eleven chromosomes so we've accounted for all before chromosomes so we basically have the sequence that dominates the human centromere so the question is what happens if we map our reach to the to this so this is the Sun one like and what we see is very striking structure so we see a pillar of a hundred base pairs here a pillar of one hundred base pairs here with a gap in between and we pull down with some see we see the same thing but now you can see that this MP box really shows up it's known that some see in reacts not just with some pay but also with sent B so what's happening is it's pulling down the whole complex that's got a B and C all together now if we look at the pair centric regions these higher order repeats that most of the attentions have been focused on before we see they don't show the structure at all so they're really diverged and they don't show they basically they have a totally different structure so this is for the young human alpha satellite sequences that dominate our sentiment in fact the the positioning is so precise it's even better than what I showed you for yeast so if we look at the we look at the homogeneity of these sequences they're all just right around 100 bit almost all about a hundred base pairs so we see this this 9999 seven nine nine hundred one hundred one hundred three so that indicates that what we have is a particle that gives nibbled a little bit by emanates but it really likes to hold together there's not much encroachment of the M&S on it very tightly packed particle and that's for someone like senator team like which is the other dominant one is two base pairs digger in a repeat unit and it's also one base pair larger with respect to the the minimal size our interpretation is that that this pillar here and this pillar here are both one base pair longer for send thirteen light so finding this these very specific sequences dominating most of our centromeres we basically conclude that human centromeres are not epigenetically defined as some have argued but it's defined by sequence very much like what i showed you the budding youth so I think that most centromeres they're going to turn out to be like this that they will basically have these single grad particles that will dominate that would be just just single sequences so it's comforting that actually sequence doesn't matter actually it's it's I I would say it's as genetically defined in humans as it is as it is inviting youth so what's in between we we looked at another centromere protein called centromere protein empty which we were not able to pull down using native but we use this cross-linking chip method that I mentioned earlier and now we see that sin P pulls down the same particle and we would deduce that if it's right in between now what is sem p simply is a histone pol protein together with WS and X forms a cut romera hetero hetero tetrameric particle that will wrap DNA and cots fukagawa showed this also showed that it induces positive DNA super coils and that was reminiscent of something we've shown many years ago for budding yeast in vivo we showed that centromeric nucleosomes induce positive DNA super drug so let's go back to the beginning of the talk I talked about portion the orientation the wrap of the DNA left-handed around the particle well we and what we infer from this and from our mapping is that both of these particles actually wrapped DNA in the opposite direction that's a fundamental distinction between centromeres and the rest of the genome it wraps DNA in the other direction here's our model for it so we think that the DNA will wrap a hundred base pairs around the particle in a right-handed manner go around the PWS x part and continue on and and continue on here and this would cover the 314 base pair oh we think that they should stack because we know nucleus on some structural work like the stack so so that's our model for it one nice thing about this model is that the connection of the chromatin to the outer kinetochore is in two places one is some C and the other sent P and both of them are facing in the same direction here okay but why the right-handed wrap so I'm going to speculate on this and it comes from the fact that when you pull on DNA forget a new clue on DNA allow the ants to freely rotate it'll actually over wind up to about 30 pica Newton's of force and then it'll unwind come come apart now that over winding is interesting from the point of view that if you first posit you're forcing positive torsion on what you're pulling so that would unwrap nucleosomes and that's not good for these guys they you really want them to wrap so you so the basic idea is that they would tighten up so here's my molecular model for tow to interface we have these these particles here these pillars and you have this T WS x over here and one of these guys is going to NP and some c are going to interact with the outer kinetochore so there's a high probability of one of these guys getting caught and getting pulled you pull on it and everything will come together so you can have a nice platform or the pull on so that's what we think that we think that the right hand is wrapped is an adaptation for it's making a platform go on rather than anything that can you can it's cried through okay so so I'm out of time actually so I'll just summarize I described first of all catch it which is the method introduced by Roger deal with his only have at Emory University showing that transcription drives turnover when she looked of us who did the torsional work and introduced TMP seek 3pi mentee for mapping pal to and showing the Stallings workers whether organic profiling is work of Siva Casa Nathan and Gabe Zentner and Gabe also did the check seek work I showed h4 cleavage work is from is involved number of people including Christina Crow South P former graduate student and Srinagar Andhra and the clustering work the the human centromere work is basically the computational work was done by Georgia Hannah cough and G Jitendra Thacker did did the wet lab work and she also did that work on the CV on the sent complexes and peach skiing is the one who introduced the high-resolution next-gen and these are our funding sources and I'll stop there and taken quickens thank you huh well ste there's a lot to discuss like always after your talk but let me focus on the dynamic issue and I think that focusing and dynamics is important because it is ignored a lot in your assays I mean one of the reasons we use cross linkers is to try to counteract dynamics after cell lysis or disturbances and I'm trying to think in your assays how you can exclude that some of the patterns are produced after a cell has been disturbed have you tried to look at any known dynamic processes where the binding pattern changes in response the signal to measure that rate of the change in your quote in vitro in your permeability cell system to try to evaluate whether the dynamics in that assay represent what would think we know about dynamic changes in transcription or other processes well the the the check sake that I showed you is a nice it's an independent way from chip it's totally independent and chip but we were pulling out the mouthpiece but we look at just a short time point they correspond to what we see by chip quite quite remarkably well so at least in yeast now I can say with confidence that that we weren't being fooled by the either oh and the other thing is that I showed you both the cross so for a BF one i I didn't show the data actually we get the same result whether the cross link or not so that's sort of three ways of doing it and we get the same result the first approximation but it's a good point that we don't that we often don't have any we can't be sure of what's going on with whether when we don't cause let me accept that one one thing to keep in mind is that is that when micro cockle nuclear micro cockle nucleus very rapidly will get rid of any any DNA there so if you imagine a protein moving or coming off it's going to chew up the DNA so it's very unlikely I think or to come off and then remind or move around so the micro Kaka luckily should take care of that I can't prove it but it it seems very likely [Music] this is just a short question but uh do you think that the centromeric sequences are conserved between species that's a really good question and we've been looking at that so I can tell you so far so we've been analyzing we've been analyzing data now we've been pulling all the primate primate data out of the out of the databases and looking at so we've been looking for these two sequences the the two that the two dimeric sequences we see the dimeric sequences going all the way back in the coq we see these the same same two beyond that we don't so we think it's somewhere around there I don't know in time but they are conserved what I understand is that you know in the mouse cells like alphas of like sequences are more like uniform compared to the human cells so I mean the centromere yes yeah and also Terry centromeric heterochromatin see we're looking at Mouse now that's really interesting so mouse minor satellite is 120 base pair repeat that is thought to be very uniform way but remember there's this ascertained by you you can't assemble it so you're making an assumption that it's all going to be the same and nobody I don't think that anybody's deal with that critically so we're doing that now but I don't have an answer we haven't done yet what question about the transcription factors you showed that yes very strong binding sites with the mas I think you have others that are longer sure a longer time binding are those potentially sites that do bind transcription factors but have been primed for the transcription I'll tell you what we think and we're currently testing this well we think it we think that there's sites that that the transcription factors like but it does but they don't have the motif and here's how my work so Remo rose at USC has found that he can improve what the prediction because DNA binding prediction he's shown he can do that by taking the count shape parameters so essentially goes like this and the other motif you're only looking one base at a time but shape is determined by my inner thigh nearest-neighbor kind of interaction so so the shape would include the width of the minor groove eighty tends to be very narrow okay things like that also the the tilt of the bases and the twist so a role it's called so so using those parameters he can find he can find consistencies for binding that don't show up in the DNA sequence so I just got an email from we sent them our he sent him our debt our sites and he said Oh looking promising so that's all I can say so what we so our working hypothesis is that its shape that they're really recognizing when they have these preferences it's not enough to really hold it down because you really need the right sequence for that [Music] how do you think new centromeres evolved regarding this yeah that's a good question because I think a big quit point of it being genetic I would just point out that all I'm talking about our needed centromeres that the vast majority of centers but there are few there's a one in ten million people or one in a million have neo centromeres that don't correspond to alpha satellite at all as far as we know they're just perfectly okay except they have never made it through evolution so far as we know there's I mean going back to overall monkeys there's not a single case where there's an eel centromere than anybody seen actually actually evolved into a regular centromere Seifer say yeah neo centromeres they do exist they're very very rare and they are not terribly successful so I think what we're looking at here is a highly evolved situation and you can understand the reason it would be highly involved you want to MIT you really want to make your centromeres perfect because one error in one error in 10,000 is going to be is not going to make it through evolution you've got that cell division has to be perfect you can't be missing missing chromosomes so I just think that what we see is an optimized situation where you have these these perfect perfect positioning to get perfect it could be perfect but neo centromeres are examples where that doesn't happen and their epigenetic I fully agree but they're so rare that I don't think we really should focus so much attention on it so what you find out what I'm kind of reacting is the fact that just about every paper you read about human sensors will basically say or centromeres will say all centromeres are epic genetically inherited but that's all based on on these rare events or on artificial chromosomes which don't really work very well but I would say that once you actually see what's there it's remarkably remarkably precise yeah so the structure centromeric nucleosomes has been discussed a lot and i don't know that we need to rehash that here but I'm curious whether your model the dynamic model that you're Illustrated with your little rope playing pieces could account for some of that variability and have you tried to look at centromere structures at different stages of the cell cycle no this is all from from a cell line well I can't say so it's uh from local live a blast like so on i'm craig Venter there's other whip a blast Lloyd cell line to show the same thing but HeLa cells also show the same thing so because we looked at the chip data from there so I don't and and the other thing is that there's also this its haploid cell line that was used in in the eichler study where we did the detect bio sequencing and we we basically see the same he basically longer rays of the Sun one line so what we're seeing I can say is general the human genome I I think we have another example those are that's epigenetic okay so I was making a distinction and answered your question about about neo centromeres and they occur from time to time in the human population in the germ line they occur frequently in cancer and those are epigenetic centromeres absolutely I'm not denying that I'm just saying when you look at the evolved centromeres are natural centromeres the ones that we're most interested in that's not what we see
