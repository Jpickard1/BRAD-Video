she's previously worked with stork him at Stanford and Eileen Doolin and NC Cox at Chicago and she's part of gtex and she's done some significant work in pharmacogenomics which would be relevant to some of Brian's work if you were here her work is focusing on understanding how genotypic variation is associated with phenotypic variation and should we talk about some of our systems approaches for integrating gene expression regulatory variation to understanding complex traits okay my own I'm on Thank You Allen for the introduction and thanks for the invitation for me to be here with you today all right it works cool okay so we know gene expression regulation is key to understanding complex traits because we've consistent consistently seen that she was associated variants are enriched for things like eqtls or open chromatin regions DNA hypersensitivity sites we also know RNA splicing is key as we see life in QTL is enriched and us associated low sigh the most recent model for all of this is the Omni genic model I'm sure many of you have heard about right so the idea that both cysts and trans effects on gene expression are important for complex traits basically the entire regulatory network affects every trait and then your key genes or your core genes so a lot of this still needs to be shown empirically but the model seems to fit what we know about many complex traits so what my lab has worked on for the past few years is how can we integrate gene expression into complex trait genetics from the beginning so rather than you know taking us results and doing a post hoc analysis seeing are these snips eqtls etc how can we integrate this known relationship to search for genes that are associated with complex traits and today I'm going to talk about how we can do this across tissues by taking advantage of the gtex data so the genotype tissue expression project has RNA seek data from 44 tissues and then after we talk about across tissues we'll talk about how we can integrate gene expression into complex trade genetics across populations so data that I will be talking about are from ASA the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis as well as looking for replication and some of the hapmap eqtl data that's out there so the major problem with both of these studies is that most eqtl analyses have been done in whole blood and white people right so in order to see how we're doing in these smaller sample sets that are available for gtex and Nathan and other cohorts we're also integrating data from European ancestry cohorts from RNA seek from the dgn cohort which is about 902 individuals and then we have gene expression microarray data from 4,800 individuals of the Framingham Heart Study but both of these are whole blood samples but we can see what we can how we can integrate these larger datasets with the smaller ones that tell us that can help us understand how things work across tissues and across populations sorry I didn't hear you oh sorry so the n here is the sample size in these cohorts thank you for your question so so gtex there's 44 tissues the smallest sample size tissues have about 70 individuals and the biggest of the version of gtex that I'll be talking about today had 360 and then the rest are the number of individuals in various subpopulations of these datasets okay so before we can get to answering these questions the first thing we want to understand is the genetic architecture of gene expression itself so before we look at different complex traits like complex disease we just want to do step one of a central dogma alright so how did variation in DNA lead to variation in RNA and if we can't understand that can we predict it from DNA can we predict RNA from DNA so before I get into gene expression I just want to talk about what I mean by genetic architecture so we can look at gos results post hoc and it they will tell us something about the genetic architecture of complex traits so this takes us back ten years more than ten years now to the first big G loss this is big at the time two thousand cases three thousand controls from the Wellcome Trust case-control consortium I'm just showing two of the results from that initial study so phenotype like type one diabetes we actually got or they actually got genome-wide significant hits right so these Peaks and Green met our statistical significance threshold for genome-wide significance in this initial jiwa study whereas bipolar disorder in this core they found nothing like nothing met genome-wide significance so this tells us something about the architecture of each trait so we can use the metaphor of actual building architecture and say type 1 diabetes is more like Chicago where I'm from where we have several large effect variants that are associating with type 1 diabetes that were discovered in this initial G loss whereas something like bipolar disorder it's more like a suburb right where you have tiny boxes on the hillside right so many variants of modest effect or small effect even are associated with bipolar disorder and subsequent much larger jaws have shown that bipolar disorder does indeed have a polygenic architecture where many snips are contributing small effects to that trait so we asked the question how can we explicitly model polygenic versus sparse genetic architecture so instead of just looking at Manhattan plots and you know guessing what the architecture and we model that from the beginning and if we do model it what does it tell us about the architecture so so we have a range of models we want to test on one end will have the polygenic model right so our little houses everywhere on the other end we have a very sparse model or maybe only a handful of variants are contributing to a trait so well for most traits it's likely the optimal model will be somewhere in between these two but we can look at the entire range and to do that we chose to use elastic net regularization and specifically how it performs at different models across a spectrum from polygenic to sparse right so we can do cross validation have some measure of predictive performance as our assessment of how well the model is performing and for some traits we may see something like this blue line where the best performance is that the polygenic end of the spectrum whereas for other traits the best performance may be at the sparse end of the spectrum and for those of you familiar with this type of Statistics the polygenic end is equivalent to Ridge regression and then the sparse and is equivalent to lasso or at least absolute shrinkage and selection operator but if you're not familiar just know that within elastic net we can very very this mixing parameter alpha from 0 to 1 and we can test anything in between which is the idea behind elastic net and what we're actually doing is penalizing our regression coefficient so if we throw in a bunch of snips that we want to see if they're associated with a trait or in our case with gene expression how we penalize those coefficient is determined by this alpha parameter and more specifically there's an statistics l2 penalty leads us to a polygenic model so this is just giving you an intuitive understanding if you want all the map you can look at the elastic net paper but the idea is we want to reduce our regression coefficients because this is the classic problem where you have lots and lots of variables and not as many outcomes or measurements right we have lots and lots of snips and not as many people in our analyses so what the hell to penalty does this is going to shrink all the effect sizes but not all the way to zero so every snip is going to contribute a small amount so this is fits what we think about the polygenic model when we do this where as l1 penalty is going to get rid of most of our snips it's going to shrink most of the effect sizes to 0 but only a few will contribute to the trait so that fits a more sparse architecture model and then of course elastic knot also does well when things are correlated to each other so we know snips are correlated to each other because of LD M so we feel it's a good model to use in genetics and then we can determine which penalty is best by doing cross-validation right so if do we get the peak at the polygenic end or the farce end or somewhere in between for the optimal predictive performance okay so moving forward so we did this for gene expression so we first started with this large at the time when we did the analysis RNA seek and genome-wide gene expression or genome-wide genotype data set dgn again this was 922 individuals RNA seek and whole blood and we tested a range of alpha mixing parameters for all the express genes so we focused on protein coding genes to start so there are about 13,000 genes that we analyzed and then we limited it to local snip variations so snips insists with the gene and we defined sis as within one mega base of each gene and then our measure of predicted performance is this coefficient of determination that we get from doing a 10-fold cross-validation where we pull out one fold build our model and the other nine and then test how well it performs and how to help out fold I'm so we're just looking at our observed gene expression - what we predict from our model and then dividing it by this sum the observed minus the mean to get our measure of R squared and we did this across a range of alphas from 0 to polygenic and to one the sparse ends and here is basically what we saw so it wasn't as variable as we thought it might be when we started so let me walk you through this figure the x-axis is the elastic mixing parameter which ranges from 0 to 1 each dot is an Elfa we test fit each line is a different gene so I'm just showing you some of the most well predicted genes right so we have pretty high R Squared's for some of these we can do prediction really well for a handful of genes and I hope you'll notice that you know well the predictive performance was very consistent across alphas there's definitely a dip at the 0 end right so a fully polygenic model does not fit the data as well as something with at least some sparse component so here we're just showing a handful of the gene results but if we look across all the genes that we tested in dgn we thought similar trend so here I'm just plotting the lasso predictive performance versus the difference in predictive performance lasso taking away either an alpha 0.05 or 0.5 alpha from the elastic net on so you'll see in this pinkish color a lot of the genes are above zero indicating that the lasso performed much better so this result tells us that the local remember we're talking about snips within one mega base of each gene the local genetic architecture of gene expression is sparse or at least has a sparse component for many genes and you know we can predict quite a few genes quite well you know an r-squared greater than 0.1 but there's definitely some that we're not predicting well with this model and we can think about that maximum predictive performance we would ever get for gene expression it's going to be bound by the heritability of gene expression right so for predicting gene expression from genotype we're only ever going to be able to do as good as the heritable component of that trait so on this plot we just we used the gcta you know the snip chip heritability from gcta for every gene so we determined in black we're just ordering each gene by sorting the gene by their heritability and then plotting in top and red the elastic net predicted performance that we got in our model and this was an alpha of 0.5 so sort of right in the middle sparse ends polygenic effects but you can see you know they move together across genes or average heritability was 0.15 whereas our average predicted performance was point 1 3 7 so we're almost reaching the maximum by using elastic net which with a sparse component but of course this estimate of heritability can also be affected by the model you choose to estimate with so I said we use gcta to estimate gene expression heritability and gcta assumes the linear mixed model so it's actually assuming a normally distributed effect size distribution so we thought well can we do better than that is this really what we should be using as our maximum predictive performance right because we're seeing with elastic net that that's first component seems to do slightly better than an only polygenic component so we turn to another model called Bayesian sparse linear mix modeling so here the effect size distribution includes both a polygenic and a sparse component so it's similar to the elastic net it's just now it's the Bayesian form of that and we can implement that with this software Gemma which I think someone here made right Zoo yeah so that's good to work with so so for the theme dgn data we also modeled the BSL mm heritability and we compared that to L mm okay so on the x-axis is the L mm heritability then we have the BSL mm proportion variance explained so similar to the heritability right we can compare these two and you see a very tight correlation right so in this sample size 922 we see a very strong correlation between how whichever model you use to estimate the heritability of gene expression right so the genes that have high heritability estimates are up here those are lower here and then they're colored by their predicted performance in our elastic nut model and we see you know stronger r-squared are up here as you'd expect because they have higher heritability with both models so so whichever mode this told us at least at this sample size whatever model we choose is robust to the heritability but what we found is when we turn to the gtex data which remember it's about 1/3 of the sample size of dgn this wasn't always the case right so with the linear mixed model we weren't getting very large heritability estimates for some of the genes that would be SL mm now we do have a large heritability estimate using the Bayesian sparse linear mixed model and we know you know this is real because we can predict these genes using elastic net and they have a high r-squared so what this told us is that when our sample sizes are smaller which when we get away from blood and you QTL studies they often are this Bayesian sparse linear mixed model is better to estimate the heritability and we can still predict genes even with these smaller sample sizes by including a sparse component in our model and another thing that the SLM M does is it will directly as to make the sparse component right so I told you it's a mixture of the sparse polygenic and it will actually give you a estimate of the proportion of sparse effects that are included in this total proportion variance explained and for the genes we can or that have high PvE they also tend to have very high almost one proportion of sparse effects so there's only a handful of snips that are contributing to most of the variance in gene expression so the ones in blue just mean that the proportion of sparse effects is significantly different than zero cuz the 95% credible set it's greater than 0.01 whereas for the lower PPA we can't tell you know what sparse and what's polygenic and then a similar trend was seen across the gtex tissues that we analyzed so these are the nine that have the largest sample size but again it gets Messier because we have about a third the sample size in all of these tissues but at least for the genes with a large PvE the proportion of sparse effects is also high in those genes so I sort of mentioned this already but I have a pretty slide for it so we know gene our gene expression architectures like Chicago so it has this sparse component which means we can actually predict with only 100 or a couple hundred samples whereas you know for a big Jewish whatever probably didn't excoriate complex' traits a gene expression is one trait because there are these large effect variants we can predict it with relatively small samples so we do that okay so the question was the snip feeding into the models where they filtered for LD and the answer is not explicitly but that's what elastic net does for us so it's going to select one of a correlated pair is the way the regularization works so so effectively it's doing it for us what percentage of G so so I would say probably twenty twenty-five percent we predict really well and then for someone to talk about predicts can now and we have you know in a tissue like GG n whole blood there's about ten thousand that have an r-squared greater than 0.01 so we herbs so we include those so that R is 10 percent but not not as good as the ones I liked above 0.5 percent they're not percent point five all right thank you all right so because we can predict in small samples this leads us to our talking about our method predicts scan so the whole idea of prediction is we want to act so so the idea of DNA variation leads to gene expression variation which can influence disease risk right and in G us we were finding throughout the community that most G us hits were in non-coding regions their addition eqtls I know Ken instead of getting a list of snips at the ends can we get genes and we can we get a mechanism for those genes right it's a higher low expression of a gene associated with a trait right so for most us we only have DNA and the phenotype but from eqtl studies we can build models to be able to predict gene expression and then correlate that with the disease or trait of interest so that's what we did with predicts can write that we use these observed transcriptome data reference transcriptome eqtl datasets and we forty-four tissues and gtex we have dgn we have other studies that I'll talk about today and we use things like elastic nut and other modeling to figure out the optimal model or at least you know the optimal of things we test and we can always test more later but we build models to predict gene expression and then make those available for use in predict scan right so we take our reference transcriptome data apply different models choose the optimal ones and then these are stored in predict TV so the user can take his or her jeewa gene types and then just multiply them by the weights that are stored in this database to get the estimate G racks so G Rex is genetically regulated expression so this is what we're testing and predict scan right we're taking the component of gene expression that's controlled by variation in genotype and asking does that correlate with our trait of interest so we do step one and two and then users can bring their IgG us genotypes in and effectively impute the transcriptome from whichever tissue or whichever model they choose and then do a simple Association test for every gene with a trait of interest so of course with our elastic models you know most of the weight for most snips will be zero but then you'll have those handful contributing to the trait that are nonzero that go into your model okay so we've run this on a lot of things other people have used it extensively I'll just tell you a little bit about one result that led us to our next method that we've developed so we applied predict scan to that original Wellcome Trust case-control consortium gos right so remember there was no genome-wide significant snips when that was first published so we used the same dataset two thousand cases three thousand controls and we did find genome-wide significant genes right so you'll notice our multiple testing penalty isn't as high right because we're not testing all snips we're testing like about 10,000 genes but I also have a bunch of lines here so the blue line is the most conservative testing correction method so this is taking into account not only the number of genes in one tissue but the total number of genes across all tissue models that you've tested where red lines down here would be the thresholds if you were only testing one tissue right so you know for this particular study of bipolar disorder - meant that more conservative threshold and one met you know less conservative threshold if you were just looking at one tissue and one thing we were noticing by looking through lots and lots of these predict scan results is that the most significant tissue you'd find right so we have models and predict DB for every single gos tissue so you can test all of them or you can choose to only test one that's up to the user I know when I'm running things I usually just run everything and look later and see what we can find which don't tell us that efficient fat how it's easier to run the code that way so so you have your you have it they'll have their hypothesis and then they'll be like okay we need to publish something right ok I'm going off topic we can talk about that later but what we find so obviously the lower the p-value you always want to lower P but let me get back onto my slide all right so we were finding that the top associated genes from predict scan were not always in the tissue that the clinician or your collaborator who really studies that phenotype a lot would expect right so for things like bipolar disorder yeah we got like LCL this top or esophagus so we expect brain so there is brain in there but we're also seeing other tissues that you wouldn't necessarily think have anything to do with bipolar disorder but you'll also notice that a lot of these genes are showing up in more than one model right it's the same Jean coming up with different models and we know you know from gtex and lots of other studies that eqtls are often shared across tissues especially cysts acting eqtls the correlation across tissues is quite high so so up here are all the brain tissues so those are highly correlated with each other and then pretty much all the other tissues in gtex are also tightly correlated I think there's outliers or liver and a couple others up here but many of the other tissues in gtex the eqtls are shared so because of this and because we wanted to make predict scan results easier to interpret but also to potentially get more power we wanted to know can we leverage the sharing of eqtls across tissues to improve our ability to detect associations okay so you probably know the answer is yes I wouldn't ask the question but I'll show you the data so to remind you predicts can we estimate so traditionally in predict scan will have a single tissue model right so we'll estimate this genetically regulated expression and then we're just simply doing a linear or logistic regression with the phenotype to see if there's an association and here's just the gtex figure of all the different tissues we have but then with our new method which we call multi scan where every gene will have up to 44 tissues where that gene is expressed so it's usually you know 20 to 30 some tissues some are unique but for most genes they're expressed in multiple tissues and then our question was can we just have a multiple regression type framework where we predict our G rec with every single tissue model and see if that associates with the phenotype so the main caveat that is that gene expression is also correlated among tissues and if the regulation of that gene expression is correlated you'll have a multicollinearity problem if you simply try to predict expression in every tissue and then just do a multiple regression like this we have a term per tissue will induce you to etcetera so what we do a multi scan is we take this predicted gene expression matrix and perform principal component analysis on the gene expression matrix and then we discard the axes of smallest variation so we just keep the piece the top pcs that explained the most variation we have a preprint that explains all the details of which thresholds we choose to use and everything but what if what we end up with then is basically a regret multiple regression where our variables are the principal components from that expected expression matrix so then we're just asking is this entire model significant right do these C's associate with our phenotype of interest and when we test this on various phenotypes we see more associated genes right so if we compare just using one tissue so here we're looking at the cholesterol phenotype and UK bio bank but we just use whole blood this is how many significant associations we find if we test all 44 gtex tissues individually and add up the number of unique genes that's the number we find and then with our multi scan model we do even better and find more associated genes and of course the significance threshold will vary as I showed before so the blue line across here is the multi scan model right because we're only doing one test for gene instead of multiple tests across tissues for gene which would be the green line so our QQ plot looks even better for the multi scan model and then this is just looking at all the different UK biobank phenotypes that we tested and it's preprint showing that you know for most of them we get more significant genes with the multi scan model versus the critics can across all tissues model okay so I've told you how we can integrate gene expression across tissues to help us you know get potential genes for follow-up it associated with traits now I'm gonna switch gears and talk about how we can do this across populations right so yeah right right so the question was if we're looking across tissues are we more likely to find housekeeping genes then you know the really tissue specific things that you might think will be crucial and and that's something we haven't I haven't measured explicitly but we definitely want to look into but we have been recommending to people you know instead of testing all 44 tissues do our multi scan model but then also pick your favorite tissue for whatever your disease or trait is to see if there are you know other genes you would find with that tissue yeah so we actually lose some some of those hits we lose that were in that table right so so you know or their Nam they're not they don't mean the threshold they're still nominally significant like that right right yeah so the question is how many genes is there only one eqtl that's you know right right so so I dunno we we tested in our original predict scan paper just using the top eqtl to predict and that did not do as well overall as lasso so for most genes we do get you know 5 to 20 snips that are in the model but you're right if you plot them out sometimes you'll see the three clusters of the predicted expression axis so so we don't have a specific estimate for you but something we could look at I do know that when we looked at a single eqtl model it did not do as well as classroom across mm-hmm okay so let's go across populations so this is the most recent figure of the bad news right of the genomics community where all of our data is in European ancestry individuals so here's the distribution of global populations here's the individuals and us studies over time and you know even though people are publishing more multi ethnic studies the sample sizes are still very very low compared to the European ancestry data that we have so we want to at least include multi-ethnic individuals in our studies and that's what I've attempted to do to bring more multi-ethnic data to our predict scan model but we have all this data here that you know it would be great to integrate as well so we're gonna test how these models do across and between populations right so no subset them by industry and also combine them and see how they're doing to predict gene expression and this is important because we know there's a lot more genetic variation and genetic diversity present in Africa because the rest of the world was populated you to a founder effect right so there's a lot more genetic variation in sub-saharan Africa and we're missing a lot of those alleles by not looking across diverse populations and they could tell us you know but we could find new genes that we couldn't find in other places okay and we know that it's bad to only have European population so this paper came out last year where they used you summary statistics for height in a big European meta-analysis predicted height in thousand genomes and every African ancestry individual is shorter than ever European score prediction so we know that's wrong right obviously wrong very wrong and similarly they found you know bad predictions for other traits like schizophrenia so we know the incidence of schizophrenia is similar across populations but all African ancestry individuals had a lower risk and then depending on whether you use the European type 2 diabetes reference versus the multi-ethnic you got completely different results for the African ancestry individuals so we know this is an issue how can we attempt to fix it and specifically for me we're looking at gene expression right so how can we improve gene expression predictive performance across populations so when I started this this is what we had in our predict scan database of prediction models so gtex is actually 15 percent african-american and our one set of models in predict eb includes both individuals who just adjusted for principal components both both groups of individuals but some of the newer versions I think they just did the European ancestry so there's there's both in gtex for your need but still you know a small proportion and then we also have young models which are just European ancestry so for this project I turn to the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis so this Mesa has been in tons and tons of gos right so any meta-analysis probably includes data from Mesa there's over 1500 papers published with this data you can access the genotype and cardiovascular phenotype and DB gap you can get the gene expression so they did a microarray analysis of gene expression in a few hundred individuals from Mesa and you can get download that from geo but of course they didn't use the same IDs so if you want to connect the two you actually need to write an application to Mesa and they will send you a map file I almost had to predict who was who and we were going to do that but they finally sent us the mapping file so we were able to do this analysis by collaborating with the Mesa folks ok so here are the sample sizes of the Mesa data so I should say this gene expression microarray data is from cd14 positive monocytes and we had 578 European ancestry 252 Hispanic self-reported ancestry and 233 African American and most of this work was done by postdoc Lauryn mobile from my lab and shown here are just the genotypic principal components of this data right so we know Hispanic is a cultural term but Hispanic individuals have genetic ancestry from any continent basically right some have more African admixture some have more Asian or Native American admixture peanut mixture as well as you know african-americans they're usually on this continuum between the Yoruba and CEU hapmap population so we need to take all that into account when we're doing our analyses as well alright so we first just did an eqtl analysis and we did it in each individual self-reported population and then we combined the African and Hispanic individuals because it was about the same sample size with the European here so we could compare those models and then we just combined everyone together right so when we're doing our eqtl analysis a range of genotypic principle components within each group a range of pure factors to adjust the gene expression data and settled on one set that was pretty consistent across those and we saw that the number of he snips and a genes we were discovering was correlated with sample size so this was great but we also wanted to show in these relatively smaller samples you know were we finding real eqtls so we look to some replication data so what I'm plotting here is the PI one measure of a true positive rate or replication rate based on the Q value statistic so and then we have four different replication populations remember the Framingham Heart Study is this big giant ones we have the most people there so we had the highest replication rate so things were discovering in the Mesa african-american are I think we look at FDR 0.05 are replicating quite well in Framingham so that's good and then you know we see trends with these smaller samples from thousand genomes or that map data so african-american eqtls are replicating at a higher rate in Yoruba and then Hispanic slightly better in the Mexican from Los Angeles population which is the MXL and then Joe modest actually includes about 340 European ancestry LCLs as well as 77 you rube up so intermediate or it's bigger than these other two replication sets that we see a higher replication rate in those population so you know our we're able to replicate better in larger samples but we also see this reflecting ancestry patterns with African American replication rate is better in uluma for example okay so we have all these eqtls what do we do next so we looked at the effect size correlation but tween the different populations in Mesa so I've measured by RG so this is a genetic correlation that you can do in gcta software and for so we calculated our G for each gene individually but because our sample sizes aren't huge you know those have large standard errors but we can look at the mean RG across all genes to get some idea of how correlated to populations are so this is our simulated data just to show when the genotype does not match the gene expression we get an average correlation of almost zero right and this model it's constrained between negative 1 and 1 so most genes go one way or the other but when we look at our observed real data this is the trend we saw so the Hispanic and European ancestry individuals had the highest genetic correlation of eqtl effect sizes the african-american and Hispanic were slightly lower remember there was a lot of African admixture in our Hispanic cohort and then African American and Europeans were slightly lower than that so this reflects what we see in the genotypic PCA plot of shared ancestry proportions we did similar analyses looking at different models with this Mesa data so we also see when we run Bayesian sparse linear McMullan that for those genes we predict well on the proportion of sparks if x is high but there are some genes where it's not as high maybe there's more of a polygenic component for some of these genes but for those with high PvE it looks like this farce component is big so we wanted to instead of just looking at polygenic plus VARs and polygenic to also add a third model which we haven't used before to meet the data so this is sort of a sparse only model so there's Bayesian variable selection regression does well when the simulated architecture is sparse and it does poorly when it's polygenic so it well her sparse tree so we wanted to test that as well across these three Mesa populations so when we did that we see it's kind of hard to tell right this is all over plotted each dot of the gene there's a few gene I'm so let me orient you so we're looking at the middle model right the sparse plus polygenic on the x-axis and then the difference between VFL mm and either L mm or the sparse PBS are here so there's a few genes we're definitely the FL mm is better than L mm but if we do a density plot instead of the dots so we can see where most of the data is concentrated you'll see you know there are some genes that do better with polygenic because they're below the horizontal line but most of them are doing better with the mixed sparse plus polygenic and there's maybe a handful of genes that are better with sparks only but even then they're still better with the mixed model of sparse plus polygenic and when you get to the larger european sample thighs there's not a lot below the zero line so when we get bigger samples for eqtl studies maybe some of these genes that have a low overall PVE maybe there will be a polygenic component we just can't see yet at our sample size but for now with the data we have it still seems best to include these mixed models right rather than just one snip or just a sparse model I don't know what when I hit sorry there we go we're back okay cool all right so we also compared on a gene level you know how our prediction model is doing between populations so again that cross validated r-squared is our measure of predictive performance so when we build our elastic nut model at this particular alpha how are we doing to me again similar to the snip level analysis of genetic correlation we do a gene level analysis the tightest correlation was seen for Hispanic and European but we definitely get genes that are well predicted in one population and poorly predicted in another so we asked why is that right so one thing we thought to look at is it simply because there's a real frequency differences between the populations so if we look at those genes that are sort of over here right where they're low in one population high in another or the ones down here do they differ in their FST right so do they have bigger allele frequency differences and yes they do so these are just choosing different thresholds of what's a big difference in predictive performance did it again sorry okay I'm trying to touch the laser okay I won't touch the laser anymore okay I'm not even touching anything now okay all right so I don't know okay I'll just touch we'll see what happened hopefully I can make it through my next few slides all right so basically what we found is the mean FST so for the snips that are in the prediction models if there's a bigger difference in performance between populations there's a larger FST right so those snips have a larger allele frequency difference between those two populations so showing you how we bill our models in Mesa but how do they actually perform in independent populations so first we just look at those of similar ancestry to document American and Hispanic we see that the african-american models and Mesa predict very well in the Yoruba and Hispanic you guys better in Mexican than Yoruba but the European model actually does better in the Mexican ancestry and this makes sense if you know that Mexican ancestry individuals have more European admixture whereas our Mesa Hispanic cohort included many with African admixture as well and then you also note when we combine populations we still do quite well in both these replications that's and it reflects the sample sizes of those replication sets and then to the plot we add on the larger replication populations we see similar trends right so the biggest sample size we do the best yeah we do best for similar industry but not bad at all when all the models are combined right so all the individuals from these are combined into one model we're still predicting quite well across all of the replication populations and then of course sample size matters right so 45 in your port you're not gonna get as tight of a correlation okay so all of these models are now available in the predict DB database under contributed so so this data has been published and they're available to use in fixed again software and I'll just have one short little story to tell you about these models so this is my student Angela and Allie own so she presented this work a few weeks ago at ASHG where we're applying these models we built in Mesa two lipid traits in the Hispanic community health study and study of Latinos so here's just showing the genotypic principal component plots these are the regions where all these individuals come from panic includes pretty much include lots of ancestry so you need to take that account into account your analysis but she what Angela did is she took all the meet the models we developed and asked how many significantly associated genes can you find with these four lipid traits and when we plot them this way you can see that again we have that simple size as well as allele frequency similarity trend right so plot is the sample size here the number of significant genes are blonde for anything genes we found across the lipid traits and then they're colored by the mean FST of the snips in the models for these significant genes I'm so the lowest and Hispanic right so the allele frequency distributions are similar in the Hispanic made the model and H DHS as you'd predict so we feel a little bump right even though the sample size is much lower we're still getting lots of genes for the Hispanic model but we still are doing the best when we use our Mason motto our model built in all of the mates of samples so larger sample size 50 that and you know I mean you can argue whether the difference between 1618 genes is that much but at least the trends match a contribution of both sample size as well as similar allele frequency spectrum so to summarize hopefully I've showed you that the local genetic architecture of gene expression includes a sparse a component so it has cago architecture and with multi scan we it can improve our power to detect associations with complex traits I will follow up on you know what kinds of genes those are and then you know expression prediction works best when the training and test populations have similar ancestry but sample size matters right so you want to if you can just use everyone that that's a good bet at this stage so my recommendation is you know if you if you're doing European just use European there's enough European data but if you have a cohort that's not European that you want to do predicts cannon you know choose models that are similar population or actually select snips that have a low FST between populations to build your models of course you might be missing that's key but right now you can at least learn something about those and as we get more data from other populations we'll be able to better understand how they transfer transfer and you know we don't want to use this red blob of data that we have access to okay so I'd like to acknowledge my lab at Loyola iterations of them and all my data sources so thanks to these groups for sharing their data through different ways than one of those data parasites the New England Journal weren't warned you about so I'm always happy when people make heard a terrible and I also thank thanks I'll take questions couple questions questions related to multi scanned so more Jing's doesn't mean better performance right right right so you want to look at your replication rate really right yeah and so you try to use PCA to decouple step coupling in different samples there's a quick way but I'm not sure ways where is the most elegant rate is it possible to add an additional accurate regularization terms to restrict that expression for the sampling is similar across tissues ya know so you're saying like a better way to do it would potentially be explicitly model instead correlation instead of forcefully with moving those correlations I think yeah yeah that's something we can look into and compare to see how it thank you another question about the multi skin seems like the information that you're losing and that is their relevant tissues that you might not have previously considered like your collaborators might not think liver is there any way to recover that information I think so so right if you run multi scan instead of running every tissue you might miss out on something that's real right yeah if you could actually do that from the data or just run every do multi scan first if you don't find anything right everything so from your data since you have a lot of data in Europeans and you have strong eqtls for some of those signals can you look at the LD Block in that and then look at the few tissues you have any other ancestries and find the causal variant for example to find mapping using the variant that actually has new QTL signature in that LD block and Africans that where the LD breaks down right right so I didn't I didn't talk about integrating LD at all and that's actually what we're working on now is can we look at he or the local ancestry of some of some of these regions to see if we can and ultimately we want the causal genes in our model right but at this stage we don't have that so we just see what performs the best but we can definitely narrow it down by using some of those other fine mapping tools okay listen there again [Applause]
