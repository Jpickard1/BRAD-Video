[Laughter] yes I think we'll get started we have a pretty full house and everyone seems to be fairly settled so welcome the tools and technology seminar series we've got a few new faces here so I'll just give you a little introduction it's busy seminar series a weekly seminar series it's a venue discuss tools technologies methodologies that are useful for researchers that are in development recently developed spans range there so there's a sign in sheet going around please do to sign your name it's just to help us justify the pizza do I getting weak tweet John please do you present today's speaker Debra McCaffrey she is a business systems analyst for health information technology and services that's not what you are that's nothing you said oh that's because HR doesn't have my what is your title huh research computing facilitator she's researching a facilitator for health information technology and services and she's going to talk to us about the electronic system great so just real quick I want to see who I'm talking to so how many computational people do we have okay any wet lab people nope okay that's a shame they can use this too anyway and is it mostly students some faculty some staff yep okay no um so like she said I'm from a JIT s specifically we are the libraries groups we've got some colleagues over here John Brian and Steve so you guys ever need help getting computational resources you could come ask us and we'll help you out I have a feeling you're pretty good at that already so cool so uh this is just a little overview what we're doing I'm gonna go into what is a little background about it some various kind of love of you stuff and then we'll jump into a demo cool so this was an interesting project that started before I got here um I'm really new I'm only like three months now anyway um George for sure came to the research IP council and what was really interested in getting an electronic book for campus so it well not me they went through a long process of analyzing different types of notebooks going out and talking to researchers and having them see what works for them Beth and eventually we found that the company lab archives was a good choice for a general-purpose electronic research a new book and so we actually got funding for all three campuses this is available in Ann Arbor Dearborn and Flint cool and it's endorsed by a bunch of high-level people so it's probably going to be around for a while which is also good so now we're just trying to make sure everybody knows about it oh so an interesting thing is that you can put sensitive data in the ER there's some caveats of course if you have clinical data there's more appropriate places to put it first like clinical trials management system or my chart or open clinica or redcap but if you're not using any of those you can put sensitive data in the notebook if any of you have any will be working with ITAR though we are not approved for that so our feeling is that anywheres better than a paper to book so go ahead put it in cool so what is it really it's mostly a data management tool it's just a place for you to put all your data organize it give it metadata to make it searchable and also help share it with anyone who might need access to the data it is secure and it is cloud-based we had a couple questions about that it's essentially running on Amazon although we also have inbox behind it for storage and what's really cool is it's this living or closet Orie it's current you can constantly change it rearrange it around it's just super flexible super fluid and just really great to help you get all your data in one place and give it a structure that works for your lab yep so this works on Amazon so you guys are just using an ec2 compute to service this but then you're migrating the diet data from inbox so that's an important thing to remember though because that's what limits your file size so blacks has a limit of 15 gigabytes per file but unlimited after that so but the actual notebook itself is all browser-based so you can use it from any computer they actually have apps for mobile devices as well and those actually have voice capture which is pretty fun so it's just really flexible tool can access it pretty much anywhere so I mentioned it is mostly a data management tool no matter what type of data you produce you can put it in the ER in any file can go in there and they do have some native editing of a lot of types of files you could edit office documents you can edit images you can edit PDF and some programs have plugins as well to help you connect the data from the notebook to the program one of them is a prism so you can open it from the notebook edit and prism and save it back to the notebook as I mentioned you can create a lot of metadata everything has description tags you can go crazy with all the metadata and all the different fields are all searchable you can even search by chemical structure if you know the smile' format for it so that I feel makes it way more powerful than a paper notebook you don't actually have to put thought into a table of contents or just flip pages you can just type it in it'll come up and search it's great Virginie yes it does so yes there's versioning and it's all time-stamped so you have a full time stamped history of everything that goes on okay which is very nice for discovery for patent are paper and you can't actually delete anything in the notebook you can hide it basically send it to trash but it will fill the air you have a very granular control over who can see or edit whatever in the notebook mint behaves a lot like Google Drive in that way you can share a folder you can share a document there's also a notebook object which is basically just the parent folder and you can share it of those levels and control over whether they can view it or if they can view and edit lots of control there and say the data becomes paper you need to make it available publicly you can do that from the notebook you can give it a DOI which is really cool and it's all just in one place where you can download Jer whatever you need to do oh and I covered that one yep well you say you can make the data available from the notebook does that mean it's actually being published in in lab archive or does the system support transfer to other like disciplinary archives that might be better places to deposit datasets I don't know there's like a specific but what you can do is export data from like PI archives and like an HTML or PDF format then you could put that to this other yeah that's incredibly unhelpful for tabular data if you're I mean if you're exporting a whole bunch of spreadsheet based data as a PDF that's essentially useless for overuse sorry to be yeah sorry that big well you might blanket on what you could use it's not a publishing engine it's a collaboration engine so if you want to share a spreadsheet with a dozen people both within the University of Michigan tribe right but if you're publishing your data in support of paper that you now have going out on you need to be about data reuse there yeah at this point serve as a repository one of the things we hope to be able to do down the line is have direct pipelines into things like deep blue data that's not there and actually prototypes purposes the DOI is not there yet either lab archives only makes things available under the cc0 so until they step that up so that there's different levels of sharing that users can select we're turning them off Oh yep I think most of the people here illogical data which is something pretty big so that's the notebook support this sort of big files internally using Mozilla officer drive and then does it provide the API to programmatically access the storage no API you can only access the storage from the notebook and there is the file cap of 15 gigs per file but what you can do is link to data with from within the notebook there's no API at all in the notebook I don't know for me B stores lives before using a different product now and we know pipeline and as they complete staff as they use it maybe going to write the results back into a dashboards but you can see what's going on okay okay but this because computational groups one of the big things that would be like appropriate in there is code in Sicily heavy thing like it lab instance or something that allows inter it's collaborative something that's versioning and management of the code so all the files in here have versions yeah not get lab since them everything you put in here gets version so you can readily track for riveting but it's not displayed in the same sense as still there people stopped reading it but it's not suspected kind of people are looking for support things are evolve branching on projects yeah and we have a get limb instance we run out of a chai tea s that's available if that's a blocker for you that you might access something so this is the big takeaway this is how to get started go to Aaron don't you may study you and this is our login page to get there and it will use your Michigan credentials to create your lab archives account it's level one so your Kerberos password and it does use duo for two-factor authentication but that means it also uses the single sign-on so chances are you might have already signed into one thing so it'll just sign you in and it's great so if you haven't yet we've got some post-it notes on the table that have a URL on them so you don't forget hope so I mentioned this earlier this is kind of how permissions work with the notebooks you have three four different types of roles you have a notebook owner who owns the notebook so this would be API in most cases you can have users who can edit you can guests those would be like external collaborators they can view only or view and edit and then you also have administrators who can control permissions of other users and guests so it's not solely on the notebook owner to manage access how is it to like change the owner easy yep there is a transfer ownership button book and so an administrator is just within that notebook the owner gets to determine who are the administrators it's not like the admins are above all owners right right so owners on tap and then you have to designate an administrator turn notebook right so here's an example of different programs that are integrated with it office good locks read Kem doodle inside it which is nice if you need to draw some structures but as I said you can put any file you want in here it's just depending on the file you might have to download it again if you want to do some analysis and then three uploaded your collaboration what's neat wiki I you guys use it as using the Google collaborate for collaborative abilities what do you mean by collaborative abilities you have collaboration I'm thinking like real-time collaboration so you simultaneously editor a word bud or an Excel spreadsheet yeah but who's on the alford web archives it's also that part ok so it's not good if you're collaborating with somebody you got to give them access to advance sign into lab archives great and this is part of the suicide do you think that that's certified EHR you want to keep stuff in there so so when I say collaboration I mean you're working with someone at Berkeley or MIT or even someone else on campus let's start there maybe even down the hall then you're going to another department or school and then go to Berkeley yeah but you're not limited to U of M collaborators cool so now I don't know oh can I change the resolution or is that going to not fly with the projector except I don't know we're cool so just real quick I'll show you this page all right so this is what the login page looks like click login if you have not signed on yet the web login comes up yeah please do [Applause] but if you are signed in it'll just take you straight to the lab notebook which looks like this basic view is you've got navigator on the left and whatever you're looking at in the notebook on your right so for the demo I'll go ahead create a new notebook and when you're creating a new notebook you can have one that's completely empty start your organization from scratch or you can use templates there's lab template classroom template you could copy from another notebook oh I need another character well create a notebook all right I'm their lab templates pretty good it's got things like protocols as a piece and that's the Esav few other folders that are already populated so these folders are all under the notebook called demo D CMB then under each folder to find this new tab you can do plenty of stuff there create new folders create new page which is the actual unit where you start taking notes you can actually copy an existing page which is super helpful so if you have a type of entry that you do all the time you can create a template page and then just copy it but I'm just going to add a new page call it something and then on pages you have things that are called entries and there's quite a number of different types of entries like there's rich text : save it and so now you have a time-stamped rich text entry you can do attachments add whatever you'd like there I have an MSDS for purity I'll add that there and you can use this one for any type of file you can tag it or searchable tags so then if I go up to the search now I look up your Dean you know I might need to go to that tag the tag pair D comes up so PDFs you can view directly from the notebook standard PDF ooh or so that's cool there other things you can do for office documents you have an office document on your computer you can upload it and then you can start editing it straight from the notebook cool you close your window refresh think about it there goes view it again and see changes are there and this is the part where you can edit simultaneously so do go through users see that you're in that document at all right you can do that too where did that go then you can check it out like file check out I think you have to go into the notebook settings to set that up but they do have that capability and I'd be by entry how can I view the history of the file as it changes that is revisions if you want to share just an entry you can do that there so that's what the revision history looks like so standard Drive box like versioning the timestamp is so and if you don't have a document already you can create a new one so now you have one directly and then it look cool you delete folders you can move them to trash essentially but you can't ever delete anything completely you can just hide it so yes so everything deleted comes down here to deleted items all right so now the type of entry I think is the most fun are the widgets go to widgets and so there's a whole bunch of widgets that you can choose from so you have something like a bacterial growth calculator right ha calculated the growth way awesome and you can create your own widgets and share those as well so these are nice for like maybe you need to calculate the concentration of your back hydrated stack solutions something like that sky's the limit with these they're very flexible so let me ask you about that this guy's so back you know we have these kind of conflicts by long did we report you know those work blow start into this I mean how much how much cake so stuff setting him up so the widgets are all in HTML so yep the product of the pipeline so you can there's a a file capture utility that you can point at a folder and it's primitive but you can say look in this folder anything appears you put it in this notebook or in this folder in this the tragedy is is that PC is I don't know how's the status the PC has to be on with you logged in and of course but but that it doesn't run as a service so if the PC is merely on and it don't work it's got you got to be on the PC and logged in as a person for that file pick up utility don't log into the notebook no not like at the login window for I see the DOS go from there connect so you know we knew so you know so you know we have to have low there it's pretty powerful thing the the initial intent of this was to replace flammable vapor lab notebooks ok damaging their life no force or losing network or leaving an institution they're leaving the notebook behind and not having got user data or taking their notebook with them the institutional longer has cognitive inside also the good news is this is uh that I'm very easy to work with Thunder most features come from user suggestions they very active forums users share widgets and a lot of the suggestions are coming from users or built in Toby okay yeah so does it support never an old-style document search so can you like open the search bar start typing in and then it shows you like the word of PDFs let's have those words Oh does the search within files let's check it out hey it can at least do PDFs so probably depends on the file right that was first time I tried it I just used the search bar I'm not sure what it's searching here but yes oh no it's coming up right um it's also highlighted my description so I'm guessing this search bar such as all fields maybe the first time I tried it it just hadn't refreshed yet or something so but here down here this is fun you can search by chemical structure first but let me show you what you can do with scriptures so unfortunately there's not a direct inner integration to ChemDraw um e users can doodle natively which is not quite as powerful but what you can do go haha I had fun just creating a molecule you can copy something from ChemDraw as mol text and then in here it's the it's a widget where's the disco widget called chemical sketcher use chemical sketcher and then if you click on the open folder button you can paste your mol file and you get your step structure from ChemDraw and then you can also do this straight and chem doodle is just limited right so now entry contains chemical structure so it's playing around with also in ChemDraw copy as smile and then putting it in the search I think there must be a discrepancy between the versions of smile or something so that's something to watch out for the smile you export from ChemDraw might not work but you can also just use the chem doodle straight into the smiles search so say I want to look for Americus all right all right so I'm going to see if there's no Matic ring with little use this cool so then it converts it to the smile stretcher for you and you can search [Music] okay look here Dean oh no that's cuz yes there we go right so now by a larger molecule came up when I searched for the fragment so there's a lot of things you can do in here lots of ways to organize which it is also a bit of a pitfall because to really be useful you need to come up with a plan at the beginning to make sure everyone follows it just so it can actually get organized and be useful for you so that's probably the hardest part and that's why I would suggest talking with Maresa and the folks at library they are good at NIDA management so but there's tons of ways you can organize it like if it's usually one person for project then maybe you'll have a notebook per person or if you have multiple people on a project you could have a notebook per project if you have a shared instrument the instrument could get its own notebook for all the raw data and then you could figure out how to organize the analysis after that there's there's just tons of ways you could do it and it's really up to your lab to figure out what is the best way for how you work yeah we're there checklist in there so like say you were doing an experiment or something and there are certain steps that you always had to go through is there like a checklist where you could you can make your own checklist widget yep so this process is related organization of the experiments organizational resistance does a supporting kind of integration to the project management or shoot rigging goals grr - ha ha so let's say we were using a product before this became available and we have a investment into that but now because of this we want to transition to this is there any way to migrate I mean I understand that there are some things that are unique to this but in terms of spreadsheets documents and common formats of things we've all migrated into this or how are we going to get all of that stuff into this what else oh so another nice feature is that all the pages in here are sign Apple was the digital signature and I can also be witnessed that's something you can set up you can have pages it's required but they're witnessed or not that is right here so for like back to the purposes of discovery you could go ahead sign your page caveat is once it's signed it cannot be modified any more so but if you find that you do have to modify it what you can do is still copy the page and have a new page that's still editable and you can keep going yep so it looks like how you're ordering entries is mostly by chronology is there any way to say if you want to keep an entry near the top of the page like pin it like if you have a link to a github repo or something like that that you always want easy access to okay let's see you can rearrange them let's see can you pin it well they'll kind of stay in the order you put them in and then with the attachment it asks you didn't ask me there it'll usually put it on the bottom but sometimes you get asked if you want to add it to the top or the bottom something again yes so if you wanted this demo hope it stopped you just visit what about ordering the pages themselves under the folders you just click and drag to reorder so folders - maybe there goes well yeah so super flexible that's what I meant by it's real fluid you can change it as you need to again the thing you had to keep in mind is this is to take a place of a paper notebook you know can you do certain things in a paper notebook that we've talked about no but this is on the cloud it's safe it's backed up it's you know I can have to worry one of the things that Steve showed us is there was these guys they went out with their paper notebook and went out to some cow pasture to do some work and they literally drop their paper notebook into the cow stuff so all their work was ruined so that's the difference now sometimes we get hit encounter signed by somebody so well not here I mean maybe like the LSA violin apartments to the faculty I talked to you there are still largely I'm even people who are doing a lot of computational work or a lot of you know day to have you work a lot of them are still using paper notebooks are not a lot of people who have systematic electronic but you know I think it's important to point out that here you know you're not replacing them it's like the old er marks I mean the EMR was designed to get rid of paper so they instead of making you Nene Omar that we wanted to use or could take advantage of all the things that we could do you know we have an EMR that was like basically popping paper format epic there's a good example that it's paper format pulldown so let's see i am i come from chemistry so that's my background but like any of your simulation programs like lamps or gaussian if you do quantum you could collect like your input script your output script your script all on the same page so that you know which files went together and you can even start adding metadata make it a little more searchable or you could write down oh hey this thing in the output file doesn't look right I'm gonna redo it and just write notes to yourself about your thought process um just so you don't have millions of files without much information about them I don't know you guys are locked into this what's the last thing computer people do don't document your programs mm-hm you know this is another way you can document your work what are what is everybody using for this kind of work right now are you just throwing up some Google Docs or Evernote okay if you use Evernote you can export that and then drop it in here what are you using github nice to get home okay I think most of the labs are using some kind of combination of tools that are so integrated between themselves so we are in school nursing using combination with project management integrated the slack integrated Evernote and iris also some kind of because you know you practically people tried but it's possible to be the do everything so it's usually kind of like order oh and Google Docs for proto-writing I think that's really are what we you know now it's after time to my latitude I mean I think that's ultimately we were anything like this tableau of them we're not going to get rid of I mean if anything we're not gonna have one electronic resources support our lab it's not gonna work good then we have these work clothes in these pipeline put a lot into it so need to change it you know so so the question kind of becomes what's the integration function it's you know once kind of time stamping and stuff and what's getting me access to others you know they having a place where the data goes that other people including painting the sponsors requirement from data sharing that's a big pieces actually but my sense is it's for every lab it's a number of different tools and capabilities that we used to be great together the best way we can so this would be another tool in the toolbox but it's not yeah so there's no cost and it's supported by the central RIT so but you can get this you don't have to sit there and what are the POS when your student asleep you have their data still you don't have to worry about them taking it all with them yep how's this well if anybody works in wet lab this is gonna probably make you gasp and it goes I guess it the ethos of the notebook but I like deleting stuff off my computer when I don't need it anymore yes you can delete things what but you can do that to a lab notebook you fill it up and you find out or you get halfway through a project and you realize his projects failing this isn't going anywhere I don't need to keep that notebook for all eternity sooner or later you learn your lesson you can throw that no notebook this whole idea you know there's a scientific because you know the notebooks are what people go to then there is no consideration of back you know it would be interesting to look at the standard practice guide by button Killingly notebooks it's not like even alive so is there a data retention policy we're gonna keep this well by the way that's a fantastic question and in fact we need more discussion about that but back the data retention policies look worse than 7-year advice so that's why we're building these deep blues wantedly inexpensive archive systems including the ones we can get for me I'm inside to deal with these sponsor requirements but you're every bit as bad as what we have in US and one of the things that we think about it is when you have that Eureka moment did somebody in your lab the countersign and now you have something that brings your lawyer in see they hear without first year and the way we looked at it is yep that was more important than perhaps a few extra kilobytes of data infinite Amazon box storage yeah so that's an interesting line and I know I don't know for sure here's my gas um that that whole concept this I think has been superseded by you know what we tend to do in my laboratory every every frickin meeting we're always putting on intellectual property my provisional it's all part of what we do and I think with what the old way was just like you said you know you have put it in your lab notebook and have to have a common sign in fact I ran hydrogen you know that's the way we did it that's the way we've set it up that's the way we set up and Jim Baker's lab started the Nano Center that one off nano bio that's the way you did now however what you do is you write up your idea kind of to get a priority date for the disclosure it's kind of a two pager you send that into tech transfer in a timestamp is you put these inventors in there and then the next thing you do is you start writing the provisional patent open up that timestamp opens up a file so you can talk to the lawyer after they approve you and then you know you start writing your provisional and then the date of the provisional is you know when you've filed a provisional with the lawyer then you give that one your date so all that kind of stuff that we used to do we're not actually doing so it's important to recognize that we don't you know I years ago what you might I don't think anybody's aware of it but um there was a demonstration in my lab way back in the early days on a Windows system that we had developed for the visible human and invisible embryo project which led to a lawsuit against the Microsoft Corporation that landed a settlement of about 1.4 billion bucks because there was a demonstration in the laboratory of a windowing system that we had developed that ultimately the main inventor who was this guy out of San Francisco sunna and one it was a interesting story I think he kept his marriage going to me but anyway you know and then the lawyers came and they deposed us we didn't have any kind of notebooks but we had records about he came and give a talk and showed the seminar this is a long time ago you know the lawyers come they do poses you know you want to write a patent you know it's coming out of you no login there's an easy way to upload your two pager you get the names down tech transfer guru gun and comes back to you so you got a file you cannot talk the lawyer get the phone call your outline the provisional if you're smart about it you're right the provisional people lawyers cost down they tweak it you file it you get the date that's how we do it now there's no sign moments you know do it the patent system changed yeah everything pain first pile now oh yeah hurts to invent its first to buy and so we just all these old behaviors we don't do anything you used to have to do them but we don't we have new behaviors with electronic notebook help absolutely you know unusually for good stuff good to write it down but the real issue is that um that we've got to discuss is that lamps are made up of many people that have come and go and there's all this dy u OD around that's probably the biggest self in the room you know you got all this BWI odine you got all these people in the thing and if you had a cloud that's the band check the log on to the cloud these undergrads and grad students are doing rotations could at least stick their stop in one place that the lab would have access to you know in it's this pull you know the University of Michigan you know at the end of the day who owns everything the University of mission the Regents of the University of Michigan that's who signs the grants that's that's they own them up and so but I'm not so sure that every other grad that comes in your laboratory believes that or does that and so you know in so this is grey zones that when you do have be so many 85% of the devices and their laboratories are owned by the people going in and out their BYOD what would be the right thing to do from a s PT perspective likely it would be to log on to some kind of cloud and leave it there I think that's probably when the dust settles that's probably the SPG we're gonna right yeah we actually got a horror story from FBI undergrad researcher leave with all her photographs on his iPhone and he and she had to chase him down and I don't mind working ended up to get her photos up somewhere experiments that she needed back up his iPhone oh we have it so until the big debate right now is you kids probably know is that you know you know frankly I think it's a dead duck but you know the idea would be that it the student drinks that notebook again and they love at least go into the wired Network than they would have to be air watch but the air watch is you know it's one thing if you're working for McKinsey or Deloitte or something like that and they own your machines then they core image it and they own it but you know the student walks in it's their machine you know you know so who owes what's on their machine they own it so this this would be a strong argument for the cloud-based notebook I think the biggest argument for the cloud-based notebooks is to get around the BYOD and the encryption piece but care watch its what from my unless you can get to it among guests sad-looking yourself all right me I ran you over and I'm sorry thank you very much
