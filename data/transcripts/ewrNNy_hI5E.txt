was the many large-scale projects funded by NIH DARPA and others that he's directed over the over the years much to our great benefit around here and of course was a huge influence on the early days this program continuing right up to the present of course so he's going to talk about his latest big thing which is the trans Mart platform and try to explain to us what they're doing and how they're going about doing it you might say over two reasons I got into trance Mart in the first place you know neither what I really didn't want um one was kind of a trick I mean I was invited by these White House guys down to a bar and they started buying strong drinks they were telling me how they wanted me to go to a trance Mart mean which I agreed to do and the other one in all seriousness and the other one was that um Jill had said that I needed to do something big to follow on from the NCI be I you know and this was a huge problem actually because the NIH and I think you know many of you know many of you probably don't I worked at at the NIH for three years a day a week by fly in and Thursday night and I had an office over there in building 1 and the director's office and they were trying to ensnare me into overseeing informatics and information technology for the entire NIH and I was kind of doing that for three years and you know we had this big problem that you know we needed to create a vision that would keep on the extramural side we needed to create a vision that would benefit would leverage and grow and acknowledge this coming big data thing actually I was asked to finally they asked me the director's office asked me to write a report which led to something called the there was a process that I think is out there now Advisory Council to the director who he had you know I wrote a thing up to get this thing called the Advisory Council to the director that was about data and information what we were going to do that was my report that started that so I had created this huge briefing and the only thing a tractor and dr. Tabak who had any interest in whatsoever was Big Data I said big you know I had 85 powerpoints tipic told me cut it down to five powerpoints and every one of them ought to be about Big Data that's all we care about well that's great so now we have big data to knowledge that's coming along you know it's a little slowly you know you have three years ago you come up with the idea eventually it kind of moves through the system and you know they and I've got a slide on us it's a huge challenge as the data and information gets bigger the funding to take care of it get smaller this is a big problem and then you know and it's not this is why I'm it's a good introduction for this talk because the question is what are you going to do and so what is trance mark question mark but it's a trance mark foundation and why are they why are they why are these important to integrative informatics so what are the opportunities the challenges and the problems and then how do how does trance mark contribute to the solutions what is it the basics what's the roadmap that we've established you know what's the community look like and what's the foundation that we created to support the community which is we got the three C's so you know it's a politics you got the code you got the community you got the code and you got the content the three C's and well this is a few slides from one Mike Snyder I think you know part of the reason that I wanted to mention Mike this is in the opportunity section yeah but they are challenges you know and I you know and this is a little bit of an unabashed adverse meant and Jorge meais who was the guy who did the Snyder omits coming back for a second visit you're looking at the faculty here on the 23rd there's a Choctaw 23rd and 24th check it out but you know this is kind of the Holy Grail stuff you know here's the opportunity health the process of juices a hopeful slide I mean it could be this you know but it is a product you know if you think about the genome in the ohms and all the stuff in our environment genes my environment is phenotype you know here's another way to look at it you could put a zebrafish in there if you wanted to doesn't have to be a human you know and we have all these high throughput measurements that we're creating you know all the models and you know a lot of its at the cellular level then you got to figure out what happens at the various tissues and so on this big hierarchy hierarchies been around forever you know it really the ecologist discovered it you know probably first in science and fifties and then the brain scientists worked with it a lot and really made something out of it later by the time I got into the hierarchy for my job talk was in the mid 90s you know the only to you I presented a slide like this and you know I got the job but I think a lot of people thought I was crazy but this is really what's going on now and of course there's just like we have it's it's kind of trance like you have transdisciplinarity I mean you know the microbiome and all these things are you know kind of how they fit into the hierarchy is interesting and so you know it could be and this is one of the challenges we have with integrative informatics is you know trying to figure out when we can bring the data together all the way up the line to describe the phenotype or maybe describe populations one of the things that's a passion of mine I want to come back next term if you'll invite me and give a science talk this is not a science talk this is about cyber infrastructure this is about you know what we're building to support and enable science I do have a science talk it's in the area of pharmacogenomics and you know the dream is that you can understand pulling from various places like electronic health records and maybe pharmacy records and something about the ohms in the genome and you know you can actually figure out what drugs are good to take what drugs are not good to take and so on there's a huge problem that I've discovered over the years you know not only in the psychiatric space but I work but more broadly this adverse drug reactions adverse events this kind of thing it's it's a multi multi-billion dollar prop people die there's a lot of mistakes and you know so there's so this stuff can be you know following through on all this promise of this hierarchy in ohms and high throughput and bringing together to genotype in the phenotype could really help help help help not only health in medicine but more broadly into biology and in life you've seen this slide so we don't have to go over it other than to say it's another way it's a challenge a data integration now this is a classic some of you guys like Jeff Kyle and Kim as addicts and others that work in this world cave on starting to get into this and a big way here now Marcy knows a lot about this you know this big the challenges the old a those are little silos over there you know the so called data silo so you know when you when you go from the science to the infrastructure and they become data silos you want to bring them together in an analytic brain you need you know you need you need a catalogue of what you got you need the infrastructure you need the middleware you know all this all all up and down the stack so there's a hierarchy and the infrastructure just as there is a hierarchy in the science and you know the problem is that one database doesn't you know they say talk to another one I mean you know it's kind of sloppy language but there's the interoperability and the ability to bring data together and to aggregate that data and to dimension make it properly understand how to dimensionalize it so you can even ask questions against it and what's the statistical logic of that and could you infer anything that would be meaningful and all this kind of stuff it's the huge problem it's beyond the infrastructure but the infrastructure alone is daunting and this you know and by the way one's infrastructure in one place like even places that you might think would be similar like the University of Michigan we have a pink we have eclipses Johns Hopkins we have epic we have eclipses you know and all these others we have a Cancer Center they have a Cancer Center I I'm here to tell you since I know both places well don't think they're the same by any stretch of the imagination so how can you even get a stare data between institutions that are the same let alone you more broadly or let alone across and you ask to Europe and don't forget about China and everything else this is a international problem right now you know and let's not forget about the FDA you know this is a slide that was made up to you know for folks in the pharma industry you know they had to work with the regulatory agencies and regulatory science but you know we do - if we try and we do drug discovery or we start testing it into clinical trials their standard operating procedures you know we have to our data environments information analytics and all the rest have to be compliant with iso and all the rest of the stuff this is a huge challenge right here curation you know garbage in garbage on it's as simple as that and you know some groups pay a lot of attention to this you know well the NCBI in the EBI you know there are reference information bases across the world for informatics that they face pretty good attention to this companies that care about their data and what's getting out the other end which would be Pharma and biotech and others I mean just dealing the biological sector now deal with this I think it's you know I'd be curious to Bob to hear hear what you think we don't do a really good job of curation did nobody really pays for it lot and you know we've disconnected to librarians who curate things that's what they love to do and they're good at it from the enterprise that might be an opportunity if we could get them back in and you know that we've moving along that line here at the University of Michigan you should know that right we got Elaine Russ Brooks down on campus they've got you know a lot of activity in the library to figure out how we manage our data and information going forward for the knowledge age things have to be properly curated you know and then there's these little acronyms you know you you know I remember I used to go to meetings and I've had so many acronyms here's one when I worked at the DoD that was the worst but you know really this health IT has as many acronyms when you say Jeff is the DoD so ETL extract creates furloughed there's a lot of little acronyms I'm going to avoid them but they're they're curation skills linearly with the number of people who are creator who are curate you know there's a big experiment that was done in a library medicine on that with PubMed you know I don't know how many people have been down in the basement of the library medicine you know and seeing all those people in PubMed just working the way like beavers I mean that was the old days now they work at home more but I'll never forget when I first saw that it doesn't scale very well but it can be computer assisted you know we can stamp records with the you know metadata and you know you don't have to hand curate everything what you need is to create a data standards and metadata you know that can be you know if you've got data flowing off these machines you know just as we're doing in the lab and you know this I mean there's a lot of data in the records that could provide the metadata base you don't have to do it all but you have to have somebody in there managing your libraries it doesn't manage itself so we have a health system data warehouse we have research data warehouses we've have got lots of data warehouses around here for the billing compliance all this kind of stuff those all have to be curated they don't curate themselves and it's a growing problem and we will fall behind in the research if we don't do some of the curation necessary to bring the data together aggregated and analyzed and then a semantic consistency whether it's common data elements whether it's you know adherence to some you know you know don't you know ontology you know Marcy and Al are here we got Oliver we got some ontology surround you know moving from day - information often involves metadata and some kinds of ontology and certainly if you want to you know encode going backwards you know whether it's for encoding prior knowledge or you know you know organizing a knowledge base which is really the Holy Grail I mean you know it's knowledge that we're after creating here it's knowledge that we want to disseminate you know you you need to encode the knowledge into something largely that's an ontological scheme that has some semantic consistency and you know this D sound just like words and they are but if you want systems to work you got to have them RDF and all this kind of stuff are some of the infrastructures that we use to allow for this Madra and all these theorists working with a lot of these there's a lot of government systems big systems that we have to work with and interoperate with that hat standard ontological nomenclature systems that we have to adhere to that's just the price of doing business you know everybody wants this you've got your informatics and your tissue banking everybody knows that we have a tissue bank set up going here how many - how many tissue banks do we have in the health system anybody want to get huh probably over well over 100 I mean when I when I heard earlier estimates of 380 freezers that they wanted to put into building building 38 I mean you know it was something like that you know the we have four big ones we have a three-year this is overseen by the Office of Research we in the medical school we have a three year five million dollar per year biorepository program here with four pilots including John swallows pilot on the community libraries the head and neck pilot and others and then we once we get the structure we do have a loom system and so on and so forth everybody's gotta have a biorepository just to make manners better or worse the campus there's a biorepository - they're not using ours they've got another one for various reasons so even here there's a lot of stove piping but the idea the dream that the researchers have on the clinical side is you know you you have tissues that are in a biorepository you know those tissues are linked to patients so you have patient identifying numbers patient identifier number goes down to Bob's core next-gen sequencing is done flips over - Jim does the bioinformatics maybe Chuck grant and I'll and others get involved in metabolomic then you want to pull down the electronic health record components maybe you care about what drugs they take whether they sleep at night or not whatever do they smoke it's all going to be brought together and then the challenge is illustrated in the box it's called stratifying the phenotype if everybody's the average you know so personalized medicine is everybody's its own little box you know the way we've been doing things is everybody's in the same box probably what we want to do is run cluster analysis and create several boxes in the middle somewhere so there's statistics there and everybody wants you'll notice these little trance Marnie Rose popping up well whatever so more about that and in a few minutes so then there's another set of problems even bigger problems this come from a government report that Gary Nealon was coming in and out of this place he used to be the head of JJ science and technology and in certain fields and Jun and I were talking about this the other day neuroscience neuropsychiatric work whatever no drugs in the pipeline all this depression schizophrenia autism bipolar disease whatever no drugs in the pipeline big problem why they failed why cardiovascular is bigger market diabetes is a bigger market obesity is a bigger market so the pipelines are drying not problem Alzheimer's disease trillion-dollar burden of Health 2050 no drugs in the pipeline national problems so you know and then this other thing in the red this is real this is scary this is the truth lots of data I'm focusing a clinical research studies now not real science nature so over half can't reproduce in big labs so you know if you're pulling down data from the literature how do you know if it's any good or not that's a big problem there's been a lot of high-level meetings in government on that one and there's been a lot of studies you know where J&J would have 250 guys in an NLP a GOP lab and they try to reproduce these studies they couldn't do it so there's this kind of Collins's quote there you know it's fantastic we can do these owns we can do all this stuff we can create the new world of science but you know can we it's it's it's a very interesting dilemma right now are we able are we going to be able to create the enabling technologies to do this or are we going to go into a Dark Age period where there's a lot of promise out there and we'll get one-offs I threw this in of the last minute just to show how things are changing this is my introduction I had to give a talk at the National Science Foundation in the future of cyber infrastructure I must have been an idiot you know they've done in the term I was the keynote speaker you know so I was night before like I always do was trying to come up with the talk and I was just thinking about a timeline well you know this is important because you know if you look you know the driving problems in the NCD season we can just at that point we thought we could create you know maybe fifteen or twenty we did eight of them and CBC's they're big science big labs Don Lindberg the library medicine directory says you know look we can't put it all in NCBI doesn't scale so why don't we build 20 ncbi's to keep him going build a network of ncbi's that was the plan in a nutshell and I ain't you didn't get close to it CTSA same thing I've got a slide on we got sixty ctsas will create informatics infrastructure everywhere equals scale it bombed you know and now you see what's happening now you got sequester and all this other things clouds came up nobody knew what that was you know but open-access hearing lots of lots of about that now but it's the bottom line is the key word on this slide is public/private partnership we realized that the government could not fund all of this there was no way and that we couldn't create groups big enough at one place to do it well and then a lot of people tried and on the data side you know there was something else that happened there were a lot of groups that kind of sprung up for various reasons like the multiple myeloma Research Foundation I don't know how many people know about that place it is fascinating you should all log on in chat the story is fascinating blady kind of a middle-aged rising star in pharma she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma like 23 years ago she was told she had six months to live get ready you're never going to see your kid graduate from high school she's still around she's got a network anybody with multiple myeloma logs into the network it's like patients like me it's a community you know people who have the disease come together social networks different concept lots of that happening right now disintermediating the academic health centers from the process to a large degree you know lots happening in this space that we need to be aware of and then the Creative Commons and that kind of thing in the follow-ons that John will Vegas Don has done you know portable IRB simplified consents that kind of thing as opposed to like endless versions of paperwork you know put these things in a in a you know container and make him scale it as to the scaling problem here okay and then there's this other thing this was a classic how many people have looked know about this one the global consortium to share data genomics and you know about this when it was announced about no visited our Dean either did or a-- even though the University of Michigan Simon they called me wanting to know what I was about Frank was on some of those messages well you know the gut Mike panky and Gonzalo got going on it and then they went to their Dean and then their Dean with the Mary Sue and she told it and she forgot to tell her Elsa's more about the open science of bio nimbus later we're part of that all right this is a very important slide this was three really was created largely by Zack kahani I was at Harvard he's gonna come here and speak to us soon as a good friend you know those little stacks were inspired by little stacks that you saw in the earlier diagram I mean we talked about that you know he changed it like you know he know that expose omit was in this liner slide I never had that we got a handle inside so the idea of an information Commons with two parts you got a vial kind of a bio Malaya I don't know if this is the one or not on this side you've got the bioinformatics and the high throughput and the molecular biomarkers stuff this is this is the bioinformatics side of the equation over here okay I got it big beer beer it's this one yeah that's the molecular side of the equation all right there is the clinical research clinical discovery side the EHR pieces and all that the phenotypic representations both leaping into the knowledge Network tied together by ontologies and mapping overseen by the compliance officer that is this is a very very Marcy you must see this a lot I mean this is this is really an important important vision here very important vision okay that starts floating around a few years ago and then okay well then transpire we'll get more into the details I mean you know have all these clinical and biomarker biomolecular up and down the hierarchy into some kind of framework and then you get results so alright so let's let's get into what this is well you know simplistically you know and this used to drive me crazy in the early phone calls with J and J and I'll get to the history of the second this might be out of order a little bit you know they told in a Dana warehouse well hello it was hardly that but you know there's a data warehouse component and Frank and others and their leaders in this know what those diagrams look like and then there's some kind of middle layer there which is the middle and then you have the applications that you can run on top of the middleware that drives and drives in it's kind of a through layer deal okay there's a data layer there's a platform middleware layer and there's an application Slayer the idea is to plug and play the platform evolves under control the data you do your best you can have separate instances the applications the big key is to try to get data from one application to go into the other application you don't run bioinformatics like a poem you know you don't launch an app go in go back another app you'd like to have them kind of flow through okay there's another way to look at it okay we have a core and you know it's all dating information kind of in the middle you know there is a cloud piece more about this in a minute giving services and then plugins we're going to get into the details on the architecture and the timelines and also this is just conceptual vector but it's what we do okay and then I to be to you should mention that what's that it really do people know what that is that hit big you not many integrating bench and bedside I to be - that was Harvard they had a national biomedical computing Center and Zak honey and Sean Murphy were the brains they're working with John glass are actually partners he was the CIO and he was very supportive and Susan Churchill who was really the one who ran the show and you know a great team and they come up with this vision you know we can develop a we can build this it was the original transpired a lot of ways it really was and so what happened what happened left hand side which is the data management side in the right hand side which is the analytic side and if you look at this this is data that actually is that we invented activity within trance Mart it was long and but then we made it to work with molecules back and company could never get a molecular side to work they weren't great at pulling down stuff from the EHR they were great at organizing stuff they were great in looking at the analysis of things within the HR they could never get the molecular visa they still can so we took it we didn't who's we well in the early days when he was at Johnson & Johnson's core so the story of Johnson & Johnson's cork was that they had a hundred and twenty five data cells across sent core R&D research so head of science pulled in Eric Roslin as the CIO spent more at that times that nobody can you know everybody thinks they own their data everybody has keeping their data private we're a company we're developing drugs and compounds you are the CIO Nixon so what any spark CIO did you outsource this I mean you know we've hired a contract he had a good idea he said let's create let's let's take from the open source let's take from the ncpc's in the NIH let's think I to be do it fix it and those less put it on a cloud which was unheard of what the hell is a cloud in 2000 you know this was his little way of disintermediating all due respect to huge aperture to the IT force opinion Jerry who didn't get it and didn't want to do outsource the IT to the cloud and then work with the cloud company to make sure it was safe and secure and you could put the proprietary data in the cloud and then there's this other thing that came up and this was a demonstrated in Europe really it was between I think GSK and J&J in the early days and there's several examples of this now the so-called pre-competitive data share you know the old stool if you're working on an asthma compound and you tried a B C or D or you're working on the one that we're looking at at the FDA is cardiac tki cardio toxicity so you know there's a bunch everybody's working on the drugs you know so here's the bottom line there are cancer drugs but half of them cross cardio toxicity so what's the best thing to do in the old school the best thing to do was keep it a secret and so if J&J was developing one and they failed they didn't want to tell millennium because their millennium would have a leg up on them jj-just spent 20 million dollars on a field trial why would you want to tell them the new way of thinking is hey there's five hundred you know pieces of the network here and there are you know you know the tyrosine kinase inhibitors there's like you know over 200 of them we better share our data pre competitively so we're all kind of going the right answer because we don't have enough money to play the slot machine and you needed something to actually achieve this that became transfer the idea was you could get transport to do this if you spun it off in New York and then then the other thing is once J&J got their problems off to their satisfaction they're saying we know how to pay for this anymore it's too expensive we were in the pharmaceutical discovery business we're not in the IT business spin it off well they did we well the Europeans refers to the party they were white because they had this huge program called IMI innovative medicines initiative I am okay and the deal was it was big vision across the entire European Union there was one billion euros over here cash money from the European Union and there was one billion euros from the pharmaceutical as cost-shared and so there's a valley of death so what European Union says we will limit the value of death by forcing the academic researchers to work with the pharmaceutical companies by you know putting it in joint proposals that if they're good we'll pay the academics one to one cost share on a two billion dollar program basis funding 335 clinical and translational research studies if partnership with Pharma then what happened they needed a data sharing an analytic platform and they picked transport and then they dumped 50 million euros right now we tried to figure this out at the July meeting there's approximately a hundred million dollars of investment in France Mart right now that we're steering in the transport foundation that is a solid number probably more than half of it way more than half is in Europe largely with the e tricks initiative and the trade initiative C tmn and they're using it all and how and all the Highland academic medical centers are easy there they are there I got in a slide I know they're fun to work those guys it's fun we had a fun meeting in Amsterdam over there you can min there's us little dots so Europe is throwing okay so Europe is throwing a lot more money okay so the CTSA it's about 600 million or so a year but those there it's where the dots are but when it comes to informatics they're not really doing with no central investment no central plan no central ideas this is why the White House guys are saying gee can't you help us fix that you're a pleat nurse this is the irony of all ironies was we were chance we're transferring our code base that we paid you know you paid like 25 million for the ITB to code base and then you it's in the open source and then you shift it over to Europe and a bunch of companies and then you kill the iCube you to stop thinking about crazy so our our Center itv2 in CBO the National Center for biomedical ontologies have created it created a lot of good stuff that are going in others have to do like imaging damn it and so on but those are really going into I transfer in a big way so that's 60 plus million dollars of technology transferred into the open source you know and when I went to the NIH and Jim was with me you know to give kind of the closeout on NCI VI when they were closing down the n CBC's I chaired the you know what do we do next panel with the other pis and I remember Russell and looking at me saying you got to talk remember that Jim it's like they said we were the successful ones because everybody else was just laying down at 9:00 no they're not writing any checks for anybody public-private partnership bu the pharma companies private the government public you know only our work got its here here's some examples this is a guy named Jack Manley this is coming this is coming from a place called one mind from research it was set up to look at automatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder veterans coming back from military they and they there they they bought the whole vision hook line and sinker and they're using transport for everything in the world and they're setting up study said IH just give gave him you know about 20 million in this track TBI study and then philanthropy doing another 20 million so it's a TBI study that's on the order of you know Adney the Alzheimer's disease network initiative trance park is here's the people underneath public-private partnership here's their data environment raw data information knowledge they've got us down here kind of their knowledge repository portal notice they got a lot of other stuff but you know you'll see here a minute you'll see in a minute how this works okay here's some output the blue area data the fun interact Evi showing the i2b2 front-end we have several presents coming up now but they're still using you'll likely be to one we've got a bunch of stuff coming from a number of pharmaceutical companies that are going to make this fun and really here's the kind of data analysis data pulls from the ikb to into analytics they do have some molecular biomarkers largely in the image space there's something called c HDI the C HDI is a very interesting outfit it has one donor anonymous they have an they have a research budget of 160 million dollars a year if they need more they call the anonymous donor through immuno god it's a middleman I met the guy in some fancy new york city it's a virtual pharma company basically at six hundred researchers there there haven't totally be implemented transport yet but they're certainly looking at at home here Chuck grant Center we're just getting and hearing up and gonna put that underneath it Matthias it's got a very interesting situation because he has eight pharma companies that want to work with them that are using transpired in Europe all right now the transport roadmap go through this for a few minutes and I'll go through the foundations and I'll be done that's what we want we've got a big go live on 1.1 version coming up on September 15th you know one of the problems Frank knows as well the old transport eating three guys to set it up and took to make it run we have a thing now Frank where you push a button and it loads he said he wanted it he was the Frank Frank got in the transport before anybody else he was in on it and the earliest days and brought it to the Cancer Center for Steve Gruber's correct colorectal project it was here you were the guy way before I even knew about it he even told me about I didn't even know so you know so we've got a road map right software content community we don't want it to look like that but you know if you're not careful it also explain to you exactly why here in a minute so here's our road map that we presented to our members and founders and sponsors in July it's it's it's kind of to build mass we're here now we are releasing this on September 15 then we've got a fastball out here don't give me the details in a minute it's all this will be released long before bio IT world in April and then dot dot dot but we really this is called the promised land this is where we want to go and the quicker we get there the better off we are for several reasons all having didn't mainly having to do with who really owns the codebase with the right license and what's the architecture and so you know we're out you know so so there's a there's a there's a plan all right here's something of the problem I was gonna sit this this is problems also anyway no who's that guy Gary that's the developers it was called the developers and users me that was an Amsterdam so think about this I to be to had for developers and no commoners other than Harvard guys they said we commit we call me we got any development well I do pay Terry there's a couple people there they're all being paid by someone but not me not us so you know so I had to give the keynote and tell him what to do and I did it like for my house at three in the morning through a webinar because you know the way they had it scheduled in Amsterdam it's amazing what you do with video that's what I told him I said hey guys somewhere I said I don't want anybody looking at 1.2 and I don't want any conversations about to dotto all right and I know you guys hate bug mixing and testing all you want to do is code and move on sorry we got to release some damn good code with the thesis documentation so focus you wanna you want to help join some working groups don't as Kevin and Terry and you know my trans Marc T or are they they're not here they're working on the release they know these stories you know in the early days this came from the February in armor meeting I copied it right out of this book and this is Linux just copy oh it's meritocracy the guy in the front of the line is the guy they all respect his line is Torvald you can't control that you just find him so we've got this guy its leaves cane stand aboard these line is tour mobile he's in Amsterdam guy that works for some place called a high he's incredible I says we need to get I to be - it's a spaghetti farm underneath there make it modular so in 2.0 it's an a it's a service in and out of an API application programmer interface you know it's got to happen you know we figured oh I know we figure does take a year in a million box right he sent us an email from in three days and said it was done belief trust and you know you can't fund that you got to bring together a community and get him excited about something and get him to go that's how Linux was done that's how Apache was done that's a you know when we had all these phone calls you know and these guys are beating me over the head hey you don't know anything about check out Apache check out Mozilla check out Linux give me a call talk to this attorney because the way you're doing it is long this is the way you got to do it if you want code that people are gonna use all over the world it has a prayer I'm not saying you guys can't sit in the lab and code and create science that's absurd but if you want to transfer it to something that people can use now we have I tasted everybody uses that we have a big server there it works pretty good there's always exceptions to the rule but you know what what we need is people that create modules and then contribute modules so you might ask how does that work this is not work so you can go on and get calm how many people don't get hub Wow fair enough that's cool go on again it's the only code out there okay you got the branch the main branch is the 1.0 and in two days it'll be 1.1 you can do whatever you want with your own instance create on the branch and then we've got the techies around the world and we'll figure out based on what the users say what goes on to the 1.3 based on what's on the branch based on what people want it based on how that code looks with our code and you know every time we do it we refactor it in this is a very tricky thing I don't know yet because you have Linus Torvalds everything else over there so generally that's a huge discussion he's suited to a third party and recode the whole thing on the brain it's been back and forth we don't want to piss off our developers but at the same token we need high quality code and Linux outsources every time you move from a branch to the from a branch on github to the main branch you read code with pros I guess that would say that that so then you know so we went through all the stuff so we have it all laid out what's in white box we here's what the 1.1 looks like it's ugly but you know we do have I could be through in a box at least you know it will be released here it's the team notice you know they I sent I sent Terry to London in Terry Weymouth is a chief programmer we sent him - I sent him to London to the London etherics meeting you know in February they voted him his line is horrible you know he you know he did it on his own I mean I didn't give him any power points Imperial College London which is the court work package to lead for Atrix Luxembourg University use of core package for and Astra Zeneca and Umesh conchos the 1.1 release which really and that's what's in it the big Bugaboo was moving from Oracle to Postgres how could it be open-source with Oracle it was a historical accident that i2b2 was built on an Oracle Postgres in 2005 when I could be started didn't scale to impossible that was I'll never want you never want to do them releasing code is like now you're going to a business that's why I'm gonna start talking about the foundation in a minute this is not academic so this is the trouble here's the big if you boil it down it's simple actually what should the NIH fund and what should be on the outside and some kind of other year call you know and the problem is that all this activity is needed for academics but it's not academic writing documentation components or Unicode it's not an academic Enterprise so how much of achieve we pay for that how much should the government pay for it's a real problem it's a real problem it's right on the edge and so what happened is is in this transition from cyber infrastructure it just went through the edge and now it's on the other side of the edge and we are struggling to figure out so NIH is saying I'm still another Dean's meeting yesterday it's like we better start planning because all the reports and you know ain't you're saying that like they're not going to pay people to just do grants all day long that we have to like pay our own guys part of the time maybe the NIH allah fund is fifty percent of the time NIH is not going to build infrastructure for you you have to build your own infrastructure so there's a huge financial shift going on and this is all part of it we are right on the bleeding edge resistant and that's what gets us into these big time meetings all over the world because this is the way it's gone okay 1.2 here's I got the 1.2 release pretty much know this I got youmu still on the list we're gonna transfer all the end civi into 1.2 and that's got the site escape modules they'll be good and all the knowledge bases I wanted to show you this you know this just kind of came through the email this is one thing about running something like this be prepared from the unexpected it's like this hi guy the real Thorvald case he's a real guy Terry's great case you know so Holland since you of Matt and Holland says hey boss we're doing pretty good here's our progress report they don't report to me here's what we're doing we're putting all this in here's our plan we're going to upgrade we're good at not only have open clinica integrated with trans mark we're good here it is we're releasing the bugs we're working on the book because they're running all of Holland on it you see that one of the themes here is that Europe somehow has figured out how to do this and we haven't and we are paying catch-up and part of the thing is in from an economic you know portfolio analysis look we're not doing this right here in the United States of America and the problem is you get on the phone with these pharmaceutical executives you say hey I need a million dollars you know for this you know a foundation I need to ten million over three years to keep the lights on you already gave you you know two million bucks give it to us so it took a while to figure out you've got a hundred million dollars being invested in this give me ten percent of it over three years ten million dollars and we'll keep the code base from turning into spaghetti and that's going to work but it's just like what happened with Netscape and when it went into Mozilla that's what's happening so all the software so whether it's galaxy for bioinformatics or anything it's all better happen in this way the NIH and NSF and all of them are pulling out of the game all right I think you believe me we've done our homework there's to that old way it looks looks more reasonable I bought with the ek we need to see a guy little guy he's the API over London easy hold on hey we'll have him he's a lot of fun to be around it's created a lot of cool companies and computer science professor so there's your data there's real aware that's the analytic f-bomb there's a work blower to their sleep presentation visualization applications layer standard plug-and-play api's seediest we're paying seed it's in a lot of money in Europe it'll work quicker we get there the better so we got plans I'm gonna rush through so I can do a little bit on the foundation I do want to talk about content a little I'm gonna do it this way because you could hear more and more and more about this we're gonna put a big proposal in after the bd2k on the cancer cloud pilot project pilot isn't it's nomer and this takes away some of the stuff I was saying of course NCI put 350 million into CI big that was the biggest disaster there's two other bigger disasters in government the IRS and the FBI information systems the Intel guys won't tell you how much they spent but NIH spent three hundred fifty million North on see a big it bit it was a top-down dinosaur and so they're asking for proposals and partnerships for cancer data and processing clouds now they're gonna do three of them at five to six million apiece look at the difference in the amount of recent resource so we're going after one of them in Chicago and the open cloud consortium we Ottawa now here's something you know TCGA there's 20 TCGA data sets you know a thousand dollars and a thousand a thousand controls you know you want to be able to do some Kannamma Canales asan that you have to go through a process that takes up to a year Europeans and Harley into it we've got a way to authenticate into it best you still have to have the permissions it is a national you know in fact they cut the budget to see CGA because of it you know here's the data you can't get access to the data unless you have all these permissions that's being worked through in work at we've aggregated with Chicago is the lead the four petabytes are so of data that everybody needs on a cloud there's two clouds there Steve restricted access cloud that would include PB gap and you know TCGA and those kind of things and then that's the open access and CBI resources 85% thousand genomes whatever it's all in there it's all I had to take it's all curator god-knows-where Bob gross we got the money University of Chicago gave me this isn't the content layer so the ideas he had the biologist there you know you have sequencing weeds coming in I didn't from Bob car or from Complete Genomics of BG I have two kinds of clouds trance marks it's as the middleware and application layer on the data layer that's what we're building that's what we're proposing the NCI but you know anybody writes a proposal but a build it before you send in the proposal so we're building it now because our researchers need access to this data and we're Nagast we're not gonna build a form petabyte plus farm here at the University of Michigan to store the same data that's sitting in Chicago we will need to upgrade the optical network link but we bought is he recall some of you who heard my talk fifteen years ago we bought you know all the optical fiber you know along the railroad tracks all the way to Chicago for 20 years Paul Courant bought four million months we have the fiber we have the link to the Chicago point of presence right down to State Street right through the older that to that quarters right and then we put fiber right up the street so everybody ought to be able to look at this data in real time that infrastructure was built and so here's a block diagram you know where we're around and it's blocked there we are there there's transmog fence marks up in here threw up in there we're adding this into the Chicago open cloud consortium right now and then we got Ryan we've got some users already we want to put this in through the University of Michigan and give everybody access so tomorrow I got a meeting with Eric Nicholson to talk about this you know they're talking to the IDS and this is like partnering so if we partner with Chicago we partner with Indiana which has got all this infrastructure on the floor in huge computing maybe we can make up for some of our deficits here at Michigan and stay in the game that is the basic planning known as I said we're deficits licensing big big problem I'm gonna quit soon I'm just gonna take you through the foundation licensing is huge we do not have the best license in the world for transport code right now it's GPL version 3 anybody knows anything about ice instance starting running for the doors why it's the poison pill of all open-source license which means that if you put it into your code everybody owns a code next to it so we are talking to lawyers and spending money and racing towards 2.0 in weeks so and J&J has been the holdup so there's nothing better than sticking British Telecom and the IBM corporation on them well on the codes we own the documentation and we figured out a way to own all the 1.1 code it's just so why did it change any make a GPL version 3 license here's why because they didn't want to spin the code off into the open source and then have some company Oracle pick it up the next morning and sell it back it's exactly why it's amazing how much we got all the wiki's you can get them right through the alright so here's a list of folks that are running this code all across the country notice I put you on there Frank is an early adopter this is just a tiny little list these do not include all the projects funded in Europe on the Atrix and the CT mmm all right trans mark foundation we realized that we weren't we weren't spinning off a company so we needed a spoon it up so we held a planning meeting there's Terry there's Gil the back of Gil's head there's a bunch of people it was a very interesting affair we didn't pay anybody's way it was a blizzard on the East Coast the traffic everything was terrible we invited a bunch of people from Europe there was about 45 people that came and everybody showed up and it was really an amazing meeting and I'll tell you it was Beth because you know it's like herding the cats I wasn't running around from one room to the next keep trying to keep everybody in line and you know what it worked and because everybody kind of was committed to these words motivated by all this high-level stop it made sense and the basic idea is that if I here at the University of Michigan even with like big resources that you can get from Dean and even Canyon all this if we think we're gonna code up a future of how we're going to do this omics integration with a biorepository EHR and everything we are sadly mistaken this is a world class problem it needs a team the team is bigger than one place and everybody in the room knew it it wasn't just you know academics in fact we had a few academics something from Europe some from America it was companies PerkinElmer Thomson Reuters why Thomson Reuters we went to the Thompson Reuters office in Boston he says oh I got good news we got 12 transport app and it got it all through its going through Japan now why so what a taker because they're selling curation services on top of it so you know when companies are making money with the codebase they're willing to invest in improvement of the basse doing there so this is just starting yeah this is gonna go like Linux you know it's a the buzzword is ecosystem there's your ecosystem we have player real players with all the food and drug administration has evaluated several instances of trance mark and are very committed to sticking it in for lots of different as an example there are many companies Deloitte but delight recombinant five AM solutions I DBS PerkinElmer Thompson Reuters that are making money out of doing three more instances everywhere it's this is the thing that got out of the box I'm soon gonna be giving up my CEO ship I'm the founder we got a vision in a mission you can imagine Gil who has been serving as chairman of the board with his good friend Lee hood they were pounding me on this one at this one meeting we've got it we have goals and the goal is to you know build and sustain this platform and get everybody to contribute and keep the developers happy and keep the users happy and you know get it out there we have things that we do in the foundation to make the thing go there's our team you know we're all working real hard we have a board of directors that will increase to 15 members ten from industry briefing academics one at-large board member and one from you know a information town will banks you know the Guru of Creative Commons got keith ellison who's now our chief science officer is brilliant i vote for him to be the CEO and sorry went over that's my story invite me back next term and i'll talk from science but this is what we had to do to stay in the game here in michigan this is the best shot that i could come up with but to tell you that if I dropped over tomorrow transport would go on thank you [Applause] music I quit talking so Brian number one let me congratulate you because this has come a long way from when I first saw it a couple years ago okay and you know this looks very impressive as a potential platform I'd say that our practical experience with this has you know been for it with some pearl obviously we had a very early version right too early perhaps right but at any rate one of the the so we've encountered a number of issues with this one of the problems though is the security model and I'm wondering yeah and I'm wondering if you could say a few words about that yeah you know this has to do with the fact that you know you're dealing with data that could be for the international equivalents you know it all has to do with how good your the identifier it's an anonymizer SAR and you know if you're going that approach and that I I think that's the huge you know I'm surprised it hasn't come up in more to be honest and there's like there's another question that goes right in with this one and it's like auditing and validation because you've got all these pharma companies so the conversation and I've been having with my exec team lately is you know you know what we need to do and we got a meeting and something called Frisby which is 20 pharma companies R&D leads and biotechs it was in Paris we were there now we've got in Boston the prison meetings the next week and our pitch day at least some ovens it's related to this a little bit is don't you want to pay into this foundation enough so that we can get the code base io so certified so that you can audit it because I if I were a pharma company I was sitting in the board room over in Peyser Cambridge and the director of the whole thing that's very Matteo time I masa used to be Jim knew I was gonna get to this so I I would say that we don't have those answers quite yet I think the way that we're doing it now not to totally evade the question is it in reality most of the trans mark instances exist behind the firewalls and the pharma companies in our restricted access instances and not open access clouds and we are opening up an open access cloud on by British Telecom it's putting it in in Europe on their cloud infrastructure for the European community and it's going to be an open access cloud with the Polli de-identified records from the National Health Service 60 million of them longitudinal records so I bet you this is going to come up warned war I think that's how we gotten around it but we've got to push that in too so I'll throw that over the architecture working group and ask them to give us a report I'd really think you for as much of this can be seen as work to build a infrastructure required to improve productivity as in the pharmaceutical industry there was another side of this and that's clinical trial designs were burdened with designs that go back to 1948 that put the effects of genetic differences in the error term of statistical models and so on is there anything being done in conjunction with trance mark saw these fundamental clinical trial design problems for example I'm sure you picked up on a Kurt it's that I did mention this all stratification aspect and yet one box where those people were a different color and you know the I I think it goes I think it should be I think you of all people would wreck but Parma which is a big driver the biggest users of this transport platform has recognized that averaging everything out doesn't work and that there needs to be stratification and get to complete individual stratification as you're proposing might be road to car for a lot of them but you know it makes total sense given everything we've learned from haplotype in in ninth area of pharmacogenomics like the other pharmacogenomics if you need to now stratify on ethnicity take some examples simple examples and pharmacogenomics metabolism of codeine and morphine well african-americans down through that very well so if you can even stratify on you know ethnicities in on age you know like old people you know we're getting there take a lot more pills and younger people so the polypharmacy of facts and so on so if you are doing it for pharmacogenomic purposes or clinical research purposes stratification is absolutely critical several of the folks are talking there will be a working group on this and the Sanofi hosted meeting in Paris in November people are talking about it people are doing something about it I attended the biggest a presentation at the world pharmacogenomics conference in San Francisco and in April and everybody was talking about so they're catching up with you guys and I'd be happy to give you more details on yeah it's a good question Dennis well yeah I mean actually that's solving itself that's solving itself I've already mentioned this you know there are companies out there Deloitte by recombinant which built the first trance Martin instance for J&J when they would just become data you know the IDB s guys which EK gal created as info sense and it spun off and then it became AI DBS and they supply mostly electronic laboratory notebooks and Aparna you know especially in Europe you know Thomson Reuters huge company they bought up jingo and other other companies already Thomson Reuters makes a lot of money providing value and services on top and trance mark and often code up modules the pharma companies there in it that's just kind of happening but you know what we say is hey you you put code out there and you're using your code the rules are you gotta put it out on a github and so when we handed by OIT world Thompson Reuters hosted a community meeting over there we had about 85 people show up and you know and then gently onsen okay millennium GSK in J&J stood up there and Sanofi cherry cow it's no he stood up there he showed all these improvements the front-end that they had developed it mean our trance Martin looked like garbage and then and that's all out in the open source on the branch and then we decided and then actually Pfizer had a meeting he called a meeting in Boston and passed the Hat and said here you know foundation write an RFA pick the best guys to do it will fund it and we'll pay for 1.2 this happen so that's well on the way well on the way it's it's no ecosystem if people aren't making money and that's the thing that's been amazing about it you the government now you see it's also amazing that you know from the geopolitical perspective that you know Europe puts in all this money and you know it spreads you know the initial capitalization can come from anywhere but hence bred as it's doing in this case now I looked into the sustainability for um we went through a lot of deep dive on the sustainability miles from the Linux Foundation it turns out that the Linux Foundation members pay you might know this the member to sit on the board of the Linux Foundation you're paying a half million bucks a year and they've got you know 15 more members and you know Linux Foundation wants something done they just pick up the phone now when we had our member sponsor meeting you know we got five or six pharma companies willing to do a hundred thousand we got a number of other ones willing to do 50 thousand we got some not-for-profits and then we got some so you know and memberships we probably got you know 750 or million but you know what we were told by the companies if we could come up with some kind of deliverable like if you could deliver one by two by a certain day we would pay you for that put a price on it put a value put a 20% markup on it you take that away and so those guys came up with the ideas and gave them to us so so it's a transport foundation totally financially sustainable right now now did I have to put some money in it English money to get it off the ground yeah but is it good to take off and be sustainable absolutely hey how you doing you prefer off was recording so of watching this I see there's a lot of things going into trans smart but I'm still kind of confused on what exactly it's trying to be do you have maybe the example of a user that's used it and obtained something they wouldn't have been able to do without transport I showed one example there are many I did show the track you know I it's in fact we're collecting up a lot more of those so-called news case examples than there are many of them out there I did show the track TBI example you know and I stripped out many many of them samples right now in etrex there are currently eight of the 35 projects I'm running on the platform there's a big kids and conserve 35 cytokines and project up there you know called I you buy a bread etc etc I could give a whole talk on that you know and I can just say and I put it in my little aspect I didn't get to it Johns Hopkins University is planning a very large demonstration of transport capability within one of their units at Hopkins that I'm involved with right now pretty closely and a number of huge guys are gonna be paid to work on it so there are many many examples that are emerging there's some neat aDNA studies that are being presented at the frisbee meeting next week by a guy from Paris who's working with sac kahani so forgive me I think it's a very good question I just didn't I didn't start trying to talk together until 12 but I was looking for a few easy ones but they were all in PD up alright okay Deanna at the hook [Music]
