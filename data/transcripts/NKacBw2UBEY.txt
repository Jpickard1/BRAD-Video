okay um i'll get started uh most of you know i'm june lee i'm a faculty member in dcmb today it's really my pleasure and my honor to introduce our good colleague and friend gemma jan is a associate professor in the computational biology department at the carnegie mellon university where he is also affiliated with the machine learning department jan received his phd in computer science and penn state followed by postdoc training with david housler at uc santa cruz he then joined the faculty at uiuc the university of illinois at the barnard champaign at both uiuc and cmu he leads a highly productive computational genomics group creating a fairly large body of impactful work his work is in developing new algorithms to study study the structure and function of the human genome and epigenome with a focus on nuclear organization and its role in gene regulation with many exciting extensions to comparative genomics and single cell biology jane is well known and iscb and recon is on the advisory board of cell systems on the editorial board of genome biology and he's the deputy editor of plus computational biology jan has received many awards earlier there was an nsf career award and 10 days ago he was awarded the contact pi a um one center project for the nih for the nuclear program this used to be extremely rare but is increasingly appreciated for a computational computation-focused scientist to lead such major endeavors as the other three centers are led by job decker bill with um bill noble and bin laden the last thing i would like to point out is jen received this year's guggenheim fellowship which used to be mainly for writers and creative artists and rare for natural sciences uh one of his co-authorities in the same class is jennifer biltman who is you know his new cycle to be the latest nobelist so jen actually sort of believe me when i say this he predicted her winning yesterday half a day before the announcement so what type of multi-scale data integration he used i hope one day i'll learn so without further ado it's my pleasure to introduce jan who who's the title of his talk is probing the nuclear organization via machine learning okay can you guys hear me yes yes thank you so much for the kind very kind introduction it's great to see some of you i met you some of you i think about five over five years ago so it's great to see you again so let me jump right in so i will give you an overview of some of our recent work in this arena to develop computational methods to analyze the high-order genome organization in the context of the cell nucleus and so nuclear organization um it is you know our genome three pairs of chromosomes and human genome three pairs of chromosomes and about six feet long two meters long but they're packaged into um you know five micrometer nucleus and these kind of um packaging organizations is actually highly regulated but we still don't have very deep understanding of of this of this organization and and at the high level so we'll know that these chromosomes are very much componentized uh in the nucleus just like some other um cellular um phenomena that you see in within within the cell and they can be largely divided into say a compartment in b compartment and if you zoom in you're going to see a finite resolution structures like chromatin topologically associated domains or chromatin loops and these kind of structures are also strongly related to genome function for instance transcription and also dna replication and our recent interest really spends um many different topics that uh all related to uh this this organization um so i will briefly touch upon for instance the spatial componentization of the genome relative to major nuclear bodies in the nucleus and um also our recent work to uh to mine sort of the patterns between chromatin and also other nuclear constituents like proteins and potentially even rnas and we have a keen interest in revealing the mechanisms also the functions of these organizations in different cellular conditions and during mentioned the for the nuclear phase two and that's will be that will be a major focus uh to to to continue and my lab has a long and uh uh lasting uh interest in uh um and compared genomics so we are we have also developed a few uh some of the first uh comparative genomics approaches for comparing high-order genome organization across mammalian species but i won't talk about that today so just to get everybody uh oriented on on the same page so this is uh one slide on uh introduction hi-c it is a method to detect a chromatin reaction in genome-wide manner so you know first step involves the cross-linking of the cells and followed by fragmentation of the chromatin by digestion for example using restriction enzymes and i mean i see these um the restriction you know fragment ends will be labeled by biotin and these ligated products will be enriched uh using for instance poe down and consequently the genome-wide chromatin interaction can be interrogated in a sort of all by all manner and some earlier methods based on three c's you know one versus or or or but this approach high c's or by oil and then from these kind of data you can generate these uh so-called content maps where um these these different intensities or different patterns will correspond to different 3d genome features highest resolution as loops as you can see here like correspond to a dot of diagonal dot that corresponds to a loop but you may also be able to see these patterns along the diagonal of the contact map like these topological association domains cats where a group of chromatins are interacting with each other much more frequently than um then they're to the nearby loci and in the in the in a very in a low resolution highest level you'll be able to see these chromatin territories where these chromatins are also interacting with each other and in the nucleus space more recently there are also new developments because i i want to give one one slight introduction because i will touch upon these technologies for ligation free methods uh for mapping the chromatin interactions and the advantage of these approaches is that they can capture the interactions that go beyond the distance of direct ligations in high c and they can also delineate uh multiple chromatin loci that interactively that form these these complex uh interactions multi-weight interactions in the same nucleus because these high sifus population level when you see several loci uh show these these loops it's hard to tell whether it's not a population average whether they are actually happening in the same nucleus so these methods like sprite uh and another approach called to drop can have the potential to review these um this information so in the sprite only these approaches the goal is to capture complexes in nucleus and only dna fragments that were um sort of cross-linked together will have the same combinations of barcode and by reading out these combinations of verbal code with the same barcode and these sequences that are involved that you can read out the chromatin loci involved in the same complex as a multi-interaction in shed drop the key is to use the micro fluidics device to capture the complexes of by droplet formation so if the chromatins are can be captured by this and they are you can read out this single molecule so in this this type of data where each line is is a is a readout of a single molecule and there are multiple loci could be involved in a multi-way chromatin reaction now um when i first got into this nuclear organization field i was quite amazed by the fact that people seems to really focus on chromatin interactions like loops that they have right now you can actually map that into very high resolution but when it comes to large-scale uh structures the chromatin uh compartmentation of their spatial organization within the nucleus uh people will just say oh the chromatins can be divided into a and b if you read reviews articles including some of the very recent review articles that's pretty much the status quo understanding is that large-scale chromosomes segregated in space in compartment a and compartment b where compartment a are mostly correspond to active chromatins and compartment compartment b are mostly correspond to repressive chromatins um this is actually first discovered in um reviewed even in in the first high c paper in in uh librim at all in the science paper where you can um sort of by a simple eigenvalue analysis you can you can tell where the chromosomes are segregated in a and b where a's are open and and active chromatins and b's are more oppressive and this has been widely used in high c type of analysis by looking at the large scale chromatin compartmentations but in the in situ high c paper also from erez's group this serato salt paper about six six years ago this is in gm12878 this very high coverage high see about five billion base pair perhaps still the highest the coverage high c data so far if you look at the high if you use the very high coverage high c and then you will be able to actually see finite resolution compartmization patterns what the authors call the sub components by clustering the interchromosomal contact maps so here's actually what they did it so you take these interchromosomal contact matrix matrix where the rows are coming from odd chromosomes and the columns are all even even chromosome loci and you immediately can see that there are some patterns that show up so what they did is they can do a simple clustering they actually use the gaussian f2m to identify these patterns so the color bars of the at the top and and the side these are or um assigned sub components and they identify five major sub compartments where a compartment can be largely divided into a2 and a1 and a2 and b compartment can be largely divided into b1 b2 and b3 subcompartments and the authors show that these sub-components actually have very distinct correlations with other functional genomic data so this is very informative however one limitation of course is that such clustering needs very very high coverage into chromosomal high c content map which typical high c data doesn't doesn't really have so um a couple years ago so a new graduate student kyle in the group so he had came up with this idea and perhaps we can do something to enhance the signals of a low or moderate coverage high c data in order to also perform sub-compartment annotations and um this idea is very simple it's just like image analysis you have a distorted image or or in very low resolution like this is the mr90 low coverage high c data this is inter chromosome high c see that a lot of missing entries so our goal is to potentially enhance the signals and you can impute the missing values and if you enhance the signals you can have this reconstructed interchangeable high c contact map such that you'll be able to call sub components like these color bars here in this track these are the annotated subcompartments and with that you'll be able to annotate the sub compartment in many different cell types such that you'll be able to see how conservative or or or different these sub components are across different across different cell types because high seeded actually they're quite uh you know many cell types have high c data um so this is what what we did so we um to achieve this we train a um denoising auto encoder and using the high coverage high c data so you down sample the train value down sample the input data and then i think on the next slide i have a diagram how we actually did that and then you compute you can you can impute the missing value in the contact map by training this denoising other encoder and by utilizing the latent variables you we can use that to predict the different subcompartments and eventually we actually apply this to nine different cell types so for the first time we'll be able to see how conserved these different sub components are across human cell types so here's here's the simple diagram so this is the sparse high c contact matrix you can by you can generate this by we generated this by down sampling the original high coverage high c and this is the target dense high c contact map to train this uh denoising auto auto encoder and for the latent variables we use this highlighted the bluish highlighted region this laden variable as the input for another classifier and here we just use mlp but you know other other classifiers can may also work and as as a result you can see that this at the top here this is all result by comparing to predictions in gm1 to 878 by comparing to various other pistol modifications or even you know replication timing different fractions and you can see that this is in the original publication in terms of their enrichment and you see that patterns are almost identical showing that the performance is is is is strong and then we apply this approach in other cell types so here i'm showing you i show you two examples in k foxes 2 and mr 90. so you train the model in gm1 to 878 and then you apply this to other cell types and you can use these functional genomic data as a way to evaluate a falcon data to evaluate the predictions so you can see that at these state boundaries this is sub component a2 and this is a component b1 in the original gm12878 there is a stark transition for the active marks going from a2 to b1 and there is also a shock transition of this repressive mark k3 k27 trimethyl um you know the signal will increase and you can see the exact same pattern in other cell types demonstrating that the approach can also be uh the training model can also be translated to other cell types by uh predicting the subcomponent patterns in in a new cell type so then we um apply this to other cell types and uh to you know listed here these are all the cell types that we use this in in the publication um uh to uh review what are you know to the for for these different types of for these different types of annotations um how conserved they are and how cell type specific they are and um showing here in this browser shell you see that um for this active regions like this is a2 sub compartments they're quite conserved and for the repressive regions that you see that they're they're other both of them are relatively conserved but they also see more dynamic regions like uh this one in the highlight in the blue box here where there's only one looks like there's only one cell type hela cell that shows active subcompartment a2 so you can actually use other function genomic data as a way to assess how reliable the predictions are and you can see that if you look at the refereeing timing here and only in gila the rapture and timing is early indicating that it's more likely that this chromatin is towards the nuclear interior you can see that uh the active mine is 3k27 acetylation also more enriched in hela cells so and we found that the most most conserved subcompartments are mostly in a1 and b3 so those are those two anchors in the towards the nuclear interior or towards the periphery of the nucleus so this is good but still limitation is very clear uh the high c sub compartments do not actually explicitly tell us uh compartmentation patterns to multiple subnuclear structures they only tell us these different they are correlated you know a1 a2 are more towards nuclear interior and b2 and b3 are towards the periphery but it doesn't tell us exactly how they actually interact with other types of nuclear structures in cell nucleus so um this is the so-called nuclear bodies so so in nucleus they're in in addition to chromatins these are other other structures for instance the largest perhaps is the nucleolus but there are also other structures kaha bodies nuclear sparkles and certainly the uh nucleomina but there are other other structures nucleophiles uh paranuclear compartments and and so on so forth and we still don't know too much about um how the chromatins are interacting with different functional nuclear bodies and these type of dynamics we know that these interactions are dynamic but in the genome-wide manner how they actually interact we have surprisingly limited information so we have made some uh advances in in terms of uh integrative analysis to combine several different uh genome-wide mapping data to tell us how the chromosomes are spatially organized in nucleus relative to multiple uh nuclear bodies and and for for this this is really uh building upon our uh collaboration with andy belmont and bass bonstinzo from the first phase of our our photo nuclear project um so the one technology is called tsa seek this is using uh antibody staining combined with tsa reaction to generate these uh you know diffusible biotin labeling near the target near and then so that the degree of bytin elation becomes a function of distance from the target and through sequencing you'll be able to generate these kind of genome-wide map so this showing here this is the map for tsa for a protein called sun son which is preferentially looks like localized in nuclear sparkle by generating these these type of tracks you'll be able to read out the actually the psychological distance so for instance in this example this is about four million base pair long genomic trajectory and uh by mineral fish you can see that these probes they can clearly see that coming from um the periphery all the way to um the speckle where this yellow probe is very close to the green here is labeling the sun protein and another um um sorry you may have hear some piano at the background my daughter is having her virtual piano class right now apologize for that and so another technology we utilize the dem id so this is uh pioneered by basswensteinzo's lab and this approach is based on the creation of fusion protein consisting of a dam and a chromatin protein of interest and um for instance if you look at the lamina and then you can use lime and vitamin b to to as the protein of interest and the dam methylates a for the gatc sequence uh so it it will leave a unique methylation tag and then it can be detected by methylation sensitive restriction enzyme so you can generate these kind of sequencing plots here if the signal is high it means that it's closer it's it has more it has higher interaction higher um how to say a contact frequency to your to your target so i'll go in and these methods can be used to target different nuclear bodies and right now as long as you have the pro you know the protein to target so right now we actually have um generate data for nucleus buccos new columnar nucleolus these three different nuclear bodies so our goal is actually the goal is quite straightforward if you have these different tracks can we generate a genome-wise segmentation where different colors are indicating their different spatial positioning in the nucleus relative to these different nuclear bodies and we design an approach called spin and uh stands for inferring spatial localization patterns so the input would be the tracks that the type of data showed on the previous slide tsac or demid and we also used a high c as part of the in input and this these will uh be fed into a model actually is a is a markov random field using a graph representation where the nodes are represent being the nodes that represent genomic loci and the edges are representing uh whether or not they're adjacent on the genome or whether they they um exhibit uh high high c interactions and the the states are hidden uh priori and that's something we want to review and then these hidden states represent the spatial patterns relative to multiple nuclear bodies um so so here's just the formulation there are hidden states of the nodes and there are no potentials and edge potentials and this is a typical mrf and we use uh belief propagation to low people leave our propagation to solve this and then to assign these different states to different genomic load side and this work is has been posted on archive so just show you some summary of the results and we end up with 10 different states by applying this approach in k562 this is the cell type that we have uh most data sets so far dem id lamin b demodelucolos tsa c clem laminb and also tsa sung so you can see that these these states they show different uh distributions in terms of their signals across different for for these different input data and these different states certainly represent very distinct and unique spatial localization patterns and this cartoon basically shows correspond to the colors you know where they are in the nucleus just give you a sense their relative distances and interactions with different nuclear bodies nuclear space nuclear lamina and also nucleolus by comparing to the fission result you can see that these states do show very strong spatial positioning patterns for instance lamina and speckled perhaps not that surprising surprisingly but you can also see that even some of the more subtle states like what we call interior active states where it's actually in the interior but it's not that close to nuclear sparkle you can see that clearly that they're not that cold close to the nuclear sparkle they're a little bit away but they're also not close to the to the periphery they're kind of in the middle and one main finding is that these states they stratify the histone marks and also high c sub-compartments that i presented earlier and if you look at these you know the roads are different states and then the columns are different histomarks here in in these slides and active marks certainly they are more enriched in more active more interior states but uh some of the more repressive marks like s3 k9 trimethyl or s3k27 trimethyl there are enriched in more some of the more repressive states like lamina or interior oppressive one internal repressor two there are we think that they're perhaps uh close to nuclear nucleolus and if you look at the correlations to these high c sub compartments and you can immediately appreciate that we actually um provide providing some spatial interpretation of these high c sub compartments for instance a1 they're mostly spreading out in spatco interior interactive and some of them in interactive two but the like the some of the other repressive uh uh state uh sub compartment like b1 uh they're more enriched the interior repressor ii but they also show up in some of the other uh states so this is sort of the more refined separation of spatial componentization but the advantage of that is much more explicit telling us where the chromatins are in the nucleus relative to different functional nuclear bodies and uh in terms of function one important uh aspect when you looked at is dna replication timing uh so we use these uh rapa seq multi-fraction rocket seed generated from david gilbert's lab uh the columns here these are different fractions like from in s phase from from early to to too late and we can see that there's a very nice separation of the multi-fraction replacing where the earlier christian domains are mostly in interior and active states that we identify and the late replication domains are in in more towards the uh nuclear periphery than lamin lycone lamina lamina states and uh we even compared with uh replication timing domains and their their dynamic changes across in differentiation like this is an earlier work from dave gilbert's lab looking at esl differentiation and so they did define these uh rotation domains into constitutive earlier consideration late or developmental late regulated considered early means that during that differentiation that genomic region always exhibit early replication patterns and we found that uh for uh speckle and uh interior active and these more towards the interior then there's much higher fraction of the constitutive early refrigeration domains and the um constitutive late domains are more towards the lamina and laminar-like uh states but the developmentally regulated domains are are spread out spreading spread it out in in sort of in in the middle of the nucleus and we even look at you know one earlier work that in collaboration with uh dave gilbert's life we generated reputation timing for uh for uh non-human primates so that you can derive these patterns across different species and we essentially saw a very similar pattern so for the early conserved earlier upgrading domains they're enriched more towards the sparkle interior states but for the uh highly conserved late represent domain they're enriched in in nuclear periphery so how about their comparisons with other nuclear genome features like i mentioned at the beginning you know loops and topology associated domains i didn't put the results on comparing to chromatin loops but we did have some observations where these loops are tend to show up in the same states we identify but here's one screenshot showing an example by comparing to topologically associated domain tags so one major observation is that if the chromatin region is more towards the nuclear interior like speckle or speckle interior active regions these tabs are more fragmented they're more they're they're denser and they're smaller these tabs they act more active while if the chromatin is more repressive towards the nuclear periphery lamina associate domains and then the tats are larger and they're sparser in terms of the number of tasks in that in that region and we also compared with the high c sub compartments i showed you earlier like in here at the bottom this shows the high c sub component annotations across different cell types and we saw that if the spin states that we identify are in in sparkle or in lamina then they're more conserved or they correspond to conserved b3 sub-compartment or a1 sub-compartment but if the spin states are are in the middle interiors they interior repressive interactive then they're also more dynamic across different cell types by comparing uh to the subcompartment annotations so um this is on sort of chromosome chromosome spatial compromisation only looking at the chromatin spatial patterns in their interactions and their interactions with other nuclear bodies and um so in in emerging um how to say direction in function genomics by looking at these regulatory elements is is to look at these regulatory elements in their nascent nuclear context in their nuclear organization context so there's observations including genomic assay approaches and also some lifestyle imaging approaches to look at these patterns but in in terms of algorithms that how to look at these in the genome-wide manner uh perhaps by utilizing uh vast you know a lot of these publicly accessible data sets um it is it is still relatively lacking and then we developed this approach what we call uh m-o-c-h-i mochi and um this is published earlier this year on genome research actually also made a cover and this was led by two uh group members so former post doctor chao and also graduated in rochester so the goal is a very straightforward we want to integrate chromatin reaction that can be reviewed by high c and also the transcriptional regulatory network so we wanted to identify some spatial patterns that it's a combination of the two so what we call these modules is what we call heterogeneous interaction modules it's heterogeneous because in these modules we're not we're not only looking at chromatin loci but we also involve transcription factors and these are interaction modules they're sort of network module we want to identify these type of genomic loci that come together in this in space in the meantime they're regulated by a group of same or similar transcription factors like in this case you can see two what we call two modules are two hymns one is on the left and the other is on the left left or right and then they they they're they um they share some of the transition factors so the transform factors can be reused in different modules so essentially our goal is to have a identified group of these kind of modules where a group of genes are spatially closer to each other than expected and they're co-regulated by the same set of transition factors and we call these transcriptional niche actually this term was given by to me by generously by michael levine in princeton so he came to pittsburgh for lunch and i had lunch with um before a visit and had lunch with him and he gave me i present this work to him before we submit it and he gave me this term likely very much so he called a transcriptional niche that it sort of describes the kind of spatial modules where these chromatins are coming together and they also show functional significance so the input data for the algorithm they're all public public available data like hi-c in different cell types and we also incorporate the transcription regulatory network and here we simply used the outcome from an earlier publication the grn from this uh back at all nature methods paper where the authors used the um uh several several different approaches i think cage and also chip seek data to identify to to construct these kind of networks so in this cartoon as you can see if the target gene they consider both the proximal promoter and also distal enhancers where if the tf binds the distal enhancer and this distal enhancer is also related to this target gene and you can also draw these diagrams to show that x is um regulating a so overall you can have these uh network for in the genome-wide manner so our input is really a heterogeneous network where we consider both chromatin interaction network and also gene regulatory network and i have to say that we're not certainly we're not the first one to um use these notions right i'm giving the talk in michigan so i think really to acknowledge the indica's work and then some of his earlier papers that i think one of his review paper on molecular system biology about 10 years ago it was really illuminating and inspiring for us to develop this work and and also more recently there's some experimental work that people also observe these patterns or phenomena some some people call it the nuclear condensates and or enhancer hubs or enhancer clicks and some other um names and more recently i think this week i saw a term called heist ai h-i-c-s like highly interconnecting the answer the answer enhancer domains uh but you know you can call them in in different names but we are we call it in in a in a more computational driven computer science oriented um term like um interactive modules because i think in terms of biology perhaps there's much more work to to to do to demonstrate their functional significance so okay so a little bit on the algorithm itself so perhaps we all know these how to say community detection right um so there's a lot of work in in the in the um in the field and including some of the uh really pioneering work from from michigan so like in in this in this network how do you detect these different communities right so conventionally you try to partition the graph like in the simplest and if you want to partition the graph into two clusters you want to minimize the number of times you go across these edges but maximize the number of edges within each community right and you can generalize this to multiple cluster multiple communities and this has been widely used in social network in various application domains um but more recently you know this is from yuri laskovich's lab at stanford this is benson at all science paper what they did is they instead of looking at these individual edges they introduced these uh motif clustering in in graphs so what it shows is that in uh social network and also in some of the other networks these triangle motifs seems to have a clear advantage in having these communities community detection in these complex networks so the idea is the following you rather than minimize the number of times you cross a single edge you try to minimize the number of times you disrupt the triangle motifs so here like you go across this you partition this graph into two parts you will have to disrupt the sum of these motif triangle motifs in the middle so the goal is to minimize this quantity here showing here so the number of motifs that are being cut or being disrupted in your groupings but maximized the number of motifs within each each group so we look at this work and it was really inspired by their algorithm so we made some adaptations and changes to their original algorithm but the concept is very similar and here's the adaptation rather than using a motif we actually came up with this four node motif where these two nodes are the genes target genes on the chromatin and there are also two other nodes representing translating factors and these are the edges that are involved in the motif so this describes a simple case simple as the case where two genomic loci are spatially closed together and they're co-regulated by two different transmission factors so if you use if you look at this cartoon in in panel b here in this um heterogeneous network where the darker orange orange ones are the target jeans and then lighter ones are transferring factors you can generate this subgraph adjacency matrix so let me walk you through this so this is a subgraph adjacent matrix for transition factor 1 and two this quantifies how many times that they are showing up in the same form of the motif so you have one two five six and also one two six seven so they're two two they're showing up in two different four node motifs and four five six they show up only in one so you can do this for all these different um sub graphications matrix and you turn this into a undirected weighted uh induced graph from your original graph these edge weights represent essentially how many times they're showing up in the same subgraph and then you can do a typical say let's say spectral cross string of the original graph and then for instance this original graph can be divided into two modules him is what we call and we have some heuristics we employed in order to achieve the fact that we allow overlapping tracing factors between different uh modules to carve this algorithm mochi and um so this is essentially the essence of the algorithm itself so uh we evaluated this this this four node motif and compare by comparing to various other motifs like three node or or or bifurcating like you have four nodes but missing but you actually miss some edges and we show that this motif has advantage uh in terms of reviewing the type of structures we want in the meantime we also show that the these four normal motifs can for the modules better reflect functional connections to various other aspects like as as compared to regular network clusters right in the traditional general regulatory network you can also identify these classes where a group of genes are are are constantly interacting with each other for instance and we show that in terms of dna replication timing they show more coordinated eruption timing functionally between each other within the same hymns as compared to grn clusters and they have also high enrichment for uh some of the functional variants like eqtls and also g watts hits i think uh in e this is in uh gm12878 and also keyframes two the default related um uh snips that are more enriched in the hemps that we identified and these modules also show a very interesting spatial preferences and perhaps not surprisingly a vast majority of them are located in the active compartment regions in eight compartments so um for um the uh percentage of hymns where you know the number of genes are in eight compartments you can see that uh they're mostly in in eight compartments and the vast majority of them and this is also reflected by comparing to the tsa seek data i showed you earlier uh the x axis here the sound tsa showing the distance to nucleus buckles and then y-axis is the lion btsa showing the distance to nuclear lamina you can see that you know over you know majority of these are closer to nuclear sparkles however we also saw that there are these modules that are away from the nuclear interior that are actually close to nuclear periphery and we look at some of them in detail like showing on the right hand side this is one example where you see that um there are genomic regions like shown here each these are the genes um these are sorry the at the top these are the genes and these are the uh transition factors that bind to uh these target genes and in this him him five four one you can see that the two members two genes are on the left-hand side another three or four on the right-hand side and their long-range interactions are reflected in a high c contact map and overall if you look at these genomic tracks they are actually overall this region is close to nuclear lamina however in these gene regions they are coming off the nuclear lamina they're going towards the nuclear interior as reflected in these in these uh signals and if you try also look at the a b compartment you see that they show active compartmentization patterns so what happens is that if you think about these comments introductory this overall chromatin is is is attaching like mostly attaching to the nuclear periphery however for some of the um genomic loci they're coming off the nuclear periphery and they show uh some you know large-scale long-range interaction between them and some of them may be mediated by um these functions these these transition factors that are listed here even though the exact function has yet to be disclosed um so then and then we ask you know for the genes that are uh say they're always in these different um in in these in these modules and versus the ones that only show up in some of the cell types and we found that if the genes are always in these modules across six different cell types here or five different cell types here they have some very unique functions they show is there are essential genes or they're more more likely to be housekeeping genes although we also observe that there are genes that do show cell type specificity for instance here list here in this plot all these genes are close to nucleoli in gm12878 but if you look at their distance to nucleus buccal and nucleolamina in k-physics 2 you saw that some of them actually are pretty close to a nuclear sparkle in particular this module 276 right so it's 2267. it's actually very very close to nuclear sparkle so what might happen is that this module um and the genes in this module change their position between these two different cell types they are closer to nucoli in gm1278 but they switched position in in nuclear localization in uh k-physicist ii um you know closer to nuclear sparkling k-562 so to summarize this part uh we think that this approach may be uh an interesting some kind of patent mining framework that can allow us to integrate functional and structural features and um so we're not only looking at enhancers or genes but we're not only looking at loops and tabs but something perhaps in between your you can integrate um the observations from both and then identify some interesting spatial patterns especially if they are dynamic or they're conserved across different cellular conditions but of course you know what are the formation mechanisms for these structures right for these structures and are there assists or trans factors that are mediating these these these interesting patterns and the short answers that we don't know and uh this is actually one will be one of the uh main focus that uh in our next phase in for the nuclear consortium and early next uh uh uh uh earlier last year i wrote a preview article when david gilbert's lab uh published their their uh early working replicating uh control element that's a type of cis element that control rock creation timing and also 3d general organization and so i lay out that we lay out with my colleague jin dawn at university of washington we laid out some of these uh perspectives in in this in this um in this article and essay and if you're interested take a look so the the the idea is that we think that there are many factors that may be involved in regulating modulating both the genome function and also three genome organizations that are intrinsically intertwined so in the next you know last couple minutes um i just want to mention this um very recent work from uh graduate student roach um this this was published in cell systems and also showed up earlier in recon so at the beginning i mentioned there in addition to high c there are emerging technologies that can measure um multi-way chromatin reactions at single nucleus resolutions but the analysis tool is actually quite uh limited so far and we designed a machine learning algorithm to improve the uh first the quality and also can facilitate a lot of subsequent analysis uh from these uh say share pattern uh chair drop and sprite data so these data are quite noisy and and there could be missing information in it so the idea is whether we can train a model to denoise the original data by denoising meaning that we want to improve reduce the false positives and false negatives and we can even do predictions if i give you three four five genomic loci you predict whether or not they're going to form a multi-way chromatin reaction so i often use the analogy in social social networks and on facebook or you have these group chat right you can you know of us and you know you use wechat or other messaging tools you can form these uh group chat so the task is like i give you a few individuals they're their information can you predict their whether they're going to form a a a group chat right in in these apps so here that rather than group chat we are uh predicting whether they are forming these multi-way chromatin interactions like like i'm showing you here so with this you know force that you can predict these multiple interactions and we can denoise the um the byproduct as we can denoise the original data and we as a representative representation learning you can also generate embedding vectors for the 1d genomic loci and these embedding vectors could be used for various other tasks right say you know simple as clustering or you can use it for other predictive tasks for example so in the interest time i probably will skip this slide just show you some results but just to mention that a key structure here we use is a a type of hypergraph representation learning architecture we publish last actually also lists here in a machine learning conference called icr iclear and so the idea is that very briefly so you can decompose these the high c like contact matrix right give you these vectors for each genomic bin and for several of them and you predict whether or not they're going to form a multi-way contact like like i show here a cluster of course the the the tricky part is how you actually generate the negative samples and the positive samples are straightforward because they are observed in experiments or at least some of the ones that are more reliably observed in experiments but negative samples could be tricky but we devised some some approaches that we think mitigate that mitigates uh some potential biases and and problems so if you're ever interested you can uh look at both of these the alkalia papers have her sagan and also the cell systems paper so here's just um some some some results to show you that the method actually uh works quite well this is the original spry you can see that if it's off diagonal the patterns some kind it seems to be obscured by um seems to be good so it'd be great if we can clean this up you can reduce the false positive and false negative and um so this is the result after we denoise using what we call method matcha so sprite is developed by mitch gottman's lab in caltech and you can see that after you denoise the sprite original data if you compare with the and you aggregate them if you compare with the population high c you can see the patterns are clearer and you can see much more similarities between sprite and ic and we use some quantitative approach that use using this uh stratton adjust the correlation coefficient scc that to quantify the similarities you can see that macha denoise the contact matrix shows a much higher agreement scc score with the population ic for different types of interactions in terms of their pairwise distances and we can even also use this for de novo predictions um here's one example you know genomic progression is is is a little tricky to prove right because you have to use some other data as as to to support and um in this what i'll show you here is in this region so you're seeing three different regions you know left middle and also on the right hand side and these are the original sprite data like each row is a i would say is a cluster that sprite data identify so all of their triplets here you can see that the triplets kind of cover only cover only two of them or either the middle or the left or the middle and the right but never three of them at the same time and we think that this one may be missed by the original it's probably but captured by the machine learning approaching in matcha and um actually we use the single cell high c in the same data set in gm12878 and you can see that there are signals that these three loci are forming these uh multi-way contacts in the same nucleus and so we use some other uh tracks like there's a super enhancer here and there um these tfs also bind to these regions and their key transition factors may be mediating this this complex so this shows you the um potential of this approach to at least to predict some of the potential complex these multi chromatin reaction complexes that may be missed by experimental approaches like sprite and finally these embedding vectors that i mentioned can be used for other analysis you can see that our embedding january by my chart is highly correlated with some genome functions like dna reflection timing and also they show distinct groupings as compared to high c sub-compartment annotations in the same cell type so just to summarize or you may ask what's next so this is drin mentioned that we recently received a um-1 center grant for the next five years in nih for the nuclear consortium program and so i served the contact pi but this is really a teamwork with many other uh investigators we have uh frank albert from ucla team woo from harvard medical school andy belmont at the university of illinois and dave gilbert to florida states and uh susan ryfowski at allen's 2 for cell sciences uh jason swatlow at the university of dundee in the uk uh nicola noretti at brown and also tom steli as our intramural collaborator from nci so we formed this team as you can see that we all come from very different background so our goal is to really uh to try to solve a so-called grand challenge to really map out the nuclear organization not only the chromatin interactions in but also their very dynamic interactions with very complex functional nuclear bodies and i only showed you some of the nuclear bodies that you call this new crespace mucolamine but as i showed you in a cartoon in in the review by david spector there are many other functional nuclear bodies and some of which probably we don't even know but we hope that we'll be able to have some insight how they function in the nuclear body in in the nucleus and also their functional impact on chromatin organization and also genome function and we're going to involve generate not only the genomic data but various types of imaging data including life cell imaging and also genome imaging like olive oil paint oligostome this is mostly from ting wu's lab and my group will lead some effort in machine learning methods for integrating these various types of data and by working with frank albert we're going to generate some realistic 3d structure models to look at not only the structure itself but also the variability of these structures and ultimately we these data will be visualized in an integrated visualization platform and we want to capture various types of biological processes developmental process cell cycle environmental perturbations and our prediction predictions can be validated using uh genome engineering so our our goal is like you know there's a lot of science uh areas in in science the whole is really great in some of uh it's part that's applies to our understanding of the nuclear organization right not only the chromosome pairwise interactions but many other complex phenomena but it also applies to i think uh different lives you know where this is a team science uh we hope that uh collectively we're gonna produce something um uh quite quite unique and and interesting uh to the field and uh so i i uh and in the end i would like to encourage you to visit our uh visualization tool that we are still developing uh this is really a uh um effort by uh xiaopang julie my group and in collaboration with jason swedel's lab who developed elmer system as a large-scale visualization for microscopy images our goal is to integrate genomic data imaging data and also structure model so it gives you like some kind of google earth experience where you you this this is a platform where you can navigate the nucleus in and also looking at various types of data sets including imaging modalities and genomic measurements and also the computational predictions and modeling results and i think uh you know jlu's lab at michigan has has been having really uh enjoying or using this approach they use this tool for their own research and um so this is all great but we'll continue to develop this tool uh in the next phase of for the year so with that i would like to um acknowledge the first the funding sources from nih mostly from newfoundland for the work that i presented today and so i already mentioned uh many post trainees in my group when i mentioned their work but certainly other group members in my in my lab also contributed and this would work these work would not be possible without collaborations with our collaborators within the first phase of 40 yen and we also look forward to working closely with our um other labs in our um one center grant in the next phase and we constantly receive input and suggestion for many other labs in the in the larger for the nuclear network and with that i'll be happy to take any questions yeah thank you jen yeah even though the time is late i'll be very happy to moderate some questions uh wants to ask first you know jen that was great thanks it's brian good to see you and congratulations on your new center grand that's really phenomenal and that thank you looks good too it's good to see you um you know i just you know it looks like the speckles could be uh trans transcription factor transcriptional condensate condensates you know i mean you know i would think with your tools you'd be able to see if uh you know several successive uh topologically associated domains are contributing to the you know structure of those speckles and that maybe what you got is a super enhancer phase transition happening there i mean is that the way you think it's going yeah no i think i think yes yes exactly so i think this needs some some new analysis approaches by uh you know integrating these different features and including you know tabs and loops and also their spatial positioning and uh to to identify these patterns and as i mentioned we're particularly interested in the um say formation mechanisms why these things are happening and um and what are the important factors if you want to perturb let's say you want to experiment you want to perturb something what kind of factors or sequence elements you want to perturb to show that they're important for the maintenance and stability of these of these structures but but you're absolutely right you know we're looking into some of these uh uh structures and i think they're all kind of intertwined and they're all connected right the spatial context is important for uh loops and tags yeah yeah you know the big challenge thank you the big challenge you know is the timing you know in terms of these things kind of come and go you know correct correct and so it's just uh so one of the things i think is still you know uh a challenge is uh and by the way those cleaned up uh chromatin you know those clean um uh you know uh images that you showed are really quite remarkable but they still are con are made up by a collection of different cells that might have different chromosome states that aren't you know even synchronized with one another yeah yeah no you know i think that's important that's an important point and then uh we are also exploring uh some of those directions to deconvolve that for instance we i i didn't present but we have some ongoing work um in looking at you know single cell ic and some of the other single cell uh assays uh in that direction to look at let's say in a cell population that may undergo a quite dynamic processes and to see how they actually change and um and certainly some of these insights can be can be can be uh used to you know can generate candidates for lifestyle experiments yeah i know it's really exciting congratulations again we're gonna be can't wait for you to come visit you know and uh i see that one dinner shot that you showed was prior to covert you know [Music] looks like you have a question oh we have a question from the audience okay jen can you read it or should i read it for you um yeah okay let me see if i can uh i don't see okay thanks yeah i gotta go but i i hope we can hook up soon thanks a lot sure great to see you again great to see you and you know david gilbert's a good friend of mine you got smart guy there it's great okay all right bye-bye bye so the question is uh i have two questions first is to him in k fox just two data tf binding site in a nuclear periphery is from eurobox [Music] hemobox tfs that's not expressed in k5 system what's your idea on that second one is how do you related tads and nuclear locations can the dense and sparse tabs you show just because gene density oh no those are both are great great questions first one um i don't know we have to we have to we have to check what what's the you know we just use the um regular network from the earlier publications but you're right you know ford perhaps we should do a more careful work to further filter to look at the more active tfs but i think that's that's an um interesting question although i think our approach will still work in in in that kind of context the second question is uh important i i don't have a clear answer uh we are also looking into some of that i think gene density or or the um how to say the chromatin itself they're more active it's certainly one factor you see that this is has has also been observed in other you know tab oriented works that people look at these tabs and hierarchical paths and subtasks and you know certainly in more active regions that you see more hierarchies of of of pads so that's that's one i guess it's not really an explanation but it's it's a confirmation that these observations can be also be observed in in other types of analysis but why that's happening or i think it's it's i don't have a clear answer may ask another question quickly so i feel a lot of this 3c or high c method is limited to power wise comparison is due to the shutter rate sequencing so with a lot of the new like nanocore laundries and new technology allow you to uh like interpolate this uh interpolate this high order comparison do you have any comments on that um i saw some recent work that people are using nanopore and also pac-bio right to read out let's say multi-way there's a method called um i forgot the name they're sort of like it's like some kind of walk that you can you can you can probe multiple uh loci at the same time because the read length is longer and that certainly can perhaps potentially go beyond pairwise but yes i think you know i think i don't know if that answers your question but i think there are data sets like this that um that i think long reads will be will be helpful particularly for these multi-way multi-way contacts and job decker's live i think also has a recent paper uh specifically look using the backpack bio reads to uh look at let's say these different chromosomes whether they entangled uh these interactions or not right you can if the reader long enough you'll be able to read out right more you know beyond pairwise interactions yeah i'll follow up on that i think it's really important to have oxford like long read to validate your suspected multi-way interaction near the end you talked about how you seems to see multiple interactions in the same nucleus i think that's really a big deal because with prior block data you can always suspect right that was not synchronized for cell cycle that's right that's right that's right you know what the other direction is that when the single cell high c coverage is high higher i think maybe we can pick up a lot of those uh more complex interactions too any other questions uh hi this is tom croppola may ask a question about the difference between time variability as in dynamics and in cell to cell variability as in population variations you mentioned a little bit of single cell analysis data and your ambition is apparently to connect with the imaging data do you think that there are ways in which the sequencing data can provide distinctions between time and population variability um yeah so you know i think single cell thing goes to high see i mean the glue has already done some work in [Music] looking at single cell high c by developing new approaches to represent each cell and then you know for cells that are undergoing cell cycle you can already see that their 3d genome organization are different that uh because they're in different different uh s phase for instance and then you can see that they're they're globally they're different and uh but there i think there are still challenges for instance the resolutions are relatively low at the moment so um perhaps at the moment most of the analysis that can be reliably reliably done are you embedded the entire cell and then you you look at their their their global grouping and patterns but if you want to narrow down to individual um features like tabs and loops and uh you know it i think it will be coming it will be becoming possible but right now there are still challenges so i don't know if that answers the question but i think there are there are data sets and technologies that can can be can be used to to answer those questions right you know both for to look at the differences in the in the cell population but also if if a cell population is undergo some some biological processes or or or it as a response to external perturbations questions well that concludes our seminar jan thank you so much all right thanks very much thank you for all your attention yeah to come in april so that got scratched but they're glad to have you now all right okay thank you very much
