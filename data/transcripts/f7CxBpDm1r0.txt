hello good morning everyone i see that we have our our keynote speak here dr nguyen good morning to you thank you um so thank you so much for joining us here this morning for our data science and racial health disparities research symposium i'm marine starter professor of computational medicine and bioinformatics at the university of michigan and organizer and host for this event which is funded by the university of michigan rackham graduate school through a rackham faculty allies and student ally grant and by the department of computational medicine and bioinformatics in addition to acknowledging our funding sources i wanted to thank my colleagues in bioinformatics especially dr alla karnofsky and our student ally kevin huang for helping to organize this symposium and i also want to thank our staff members jane weisner and erin brookfish for all of their work helping to organize the symposium so i thought i'd start the introduction with a definition of racial health disparities which i found from the center of medicare advocacy i'm definitely not an expert on this and so i may not have chosen the best definition but what they say is this the term health disparities is often defined as a difference in which disadvantaged social groups such as the poor racial ethnic minorities women and other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups when this term is applied to certain ethnic and race racial social groups it describes the increased presence and severity of certain diseases poor health outcomes and greater difficulty in obtaining health care services for these races and ethnicities so socially disadvantaged groups really suffer from a host of challenges that have detrimental effects on their health including being less likely to have health insurance coverage living in more highly polluted areas having less access to healthy food choices language barriers and high rates of chronic stress the overall results are numerous and include higher levels of obesity and diabetes higher mortality rates for several other diseases and often higher infant mortality rates depending on the specific group in terms of equity and inclusivity many of these same groups tend to be underrepresented in human subjects research including clinical trials and in population genetic studies their poor representation on these research studies translates to a poor understanding of risk etiology and progression of diseases furthermore machine learning approaches trained mainly with one racial ethnic group can end up being less effective or even worse biased in the way that in a way that perpetuates stereotypes and disparities so my colleagues and i here at michigan proposed this symposium symposium because we know how important racial health racial health disparities research is and our global goal of health equity and we wanted to help educate our community that is biomedical informaticists bioinformaticians and other data scientists both on the ways that data science and other computational approaches are being used to study and address racial health disparities but also conversely how using data science and computational methods on data sets can have a negative impact and actually exacerbate health disparities so obviously rigorous data science is crucial to future health disparities research and i hope that this symposium and other similar ones will help serve to initiate our new collaborations among data scientists epidemiologists clinicians and others doing research to make health more equitable for all of us in in addition to the symposium talks i wanted to mention briefly our um our dii data challenge event which we planned in conjunction with the symposium and was led by my colleague dr christina matreya who's on here we had two different challenges for students to choose from and dr matreya will be announcing them and the winners just before lunch today so now to introduce our keynote speaker we're thrilled and so honored to have dr robert nguyen as our keynote speaker dr winn is the director of the virginia commonwealth university or vcu massey cancer center which was one of the original cancer centers designated by the nci back in 1974. last year he was named president-elect of the association of american cancer institutes for aaci dr winn received his m.d actually here at the university of michigan in ann arbor in 1993 he did his residency at rush presbyterian st luke's medical center in chicago followed by a fellowship in pulmonary medicine and critical care at the university of colorado health sciences center he's received numerous high-profile awards over the years too numerous to mention i'll just mention the most recent two were the aaci cancer health equity award in 2021 and the medical society of virginia's 2021 salute to service award for service to the uninsured and underserved he's now leading the nation and establishing a 21st century model of equity for cancer science and care obviously he is very committed to community engaged research centered on eliminating health equity inequities he's also a principal investigator on several community-based projects funded by the nih and nci including the all of us research program which is a precision medicine effort planned to run from 2018 to 2028 to study data from one million people living in the united states and with the ultimate goal to achieve and develop individualized health care dr winnis received a national and international claim for his efforts to empower underserved patient populations improve health care delivery and ensure equal access to cancer care and with that i want to thank you dr nguyen not only for presenting for us here today but for all of your efforts and work in this area so let's give dr nguyen a warm welcome and thank you very much from all of us thank you all and uh i think the saying is go blue um so i'll do my best um i'm gonna share my screen um i'm gonna start off by sort of saying that this may be a little bit of a different type of talk than you're used to there certainly will be data um but my biggest point is to get this conversation beyond just the data and what the data actually means and that connectedness to our community i really believe that we are in a point and a place right now where we have to consider the concept of place and space and the impact it has on science these are my conflicts of interest um i'll start off by saying uh and and usually really trying to frame this slide and it's a a quote that's attributed to mark twain and it says it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble it's what you know for sure that just ain't so and interestingly enough i think when we think about a lot of academic medicine and even public health there have been a lot of good things that we have done certainly there have been some things that we've absolutely held on to that we uh think we know for sure that turns out to not be so that occasionally has some negative impact the talk today will be centered around um just so that we're all framed in the context of social justice and let me explain social justice to you in a little bit the way at least i see it many people now talk about health equity and i get it but health equity is defined is a principle of underlying commitment to reducing and ultimately eliminating disparities in health and its determinants when we think about health differences we're thinking about the differences in outcomes between two groups but when i think of health disparities this is by braden but also by this is usually the warning model and the best way to sort of say it is um prostate cancer we know that there are data that are out there right now that says that african-american men and caucasian when given the same access to care let's say in the va system tend to have similar outcomes but we all know that there is a health outcome difference between african-american men and caucasians when we look at this more globally and that's related to the fact that one group has access and the other tend not to i will not be talking about health equity i will be talking about health equity as a pursuit as an aspiration but we are deep and our numbers are actually um validating that deep into continued disparities so science and how do i see all this being put together well i think we're in an interesting time um i'm gonna go back way back in time a little bit and and talk really about what i consider to be our progression of science and sciences and the latter part of the 19th century and um to a large extent to the greater part of the 20th century to the mid-20th century our focus had been on matter and energy in fact land-grant institutions many like michigan state university of illinois and many others we're really focused in those early days really on figuring out the engineering principles and going around from there to figuring out the physics of how do we split atoms to et cetera et cetera uh many of you know what that the work that has been done um particularly in the midwest at the euro chicago and other things in the context of matter and energy the next phase of science though and i put this picture up specifically for quick watson and franklin and the famous photo 51. we subsequently in 1950 change radically from just the focus on matter and energy to now being able to understand and be able to detect the human cell and the nature of that cell that change science forever in fact as a result of that we had the impact on that was that we produced people like david baltimore uh philip sharp and james allison right phil sharp been important for creating that creation of the split team that we now know uh and the whole thing about spicy david baltimore for the rest to to this day really are have been key factors in us being able to move forward in our thinking around the nature of the human cell and how to get a better understanding of it that science led the foundation for great movements such as the 1971 war on cancer act that led to the uh national cancer act and established the first three designated cancer centers in the united states those being memorial sloan md anderson and roswell park that program has now grown to 71 designated cancer centers of which your cancer center led by dr if you're on and myself here at vcu massey have benefited from the answer is it science right the bedrock is science in 1971 they made a statement that we would eradicate cancer by 1981 by understanding literally just the science and understanding the nature of the human cell we'd be able to literally eradicate science i mean eradicate cancer i submit to you that in 2022 we know that that was a little bit ambitious but we've also known that while certainly we can make some progress with the science and while it is necessary to make some gains in reducing cancer disparities it is not sufficient to eradicate cancer the aacr health competitive which i was a part of in 2020 did give us glimmer of hope that when we looked specifically at black white differences from the 1990s to then 2016 and even if you look at the trends now that we had certainly made some strides but while we made some strides it's important to point out that there were still disparities when you look at african-american men in prostate cancer versus their caucasian colleagues or whether you look at african-american women with breast cancer and by the way breast cancer for african-american african-american women now has become the number one killer of overshadowing now lung cancer we have to think about what's going on now before you start thinking that this health disparities issue is hashtag just something around race let me stop you in your tracks and just tell you that disparities are again anytime you have differences in outcomes and when you start looking again at the social justice part about the access quality and care when that is unequal you have a disparity let me give an example why geography matters a 70 year old white male living in utah versus a 70 year old male living in kentucky don't always have the same outcomes either that 70 year old male in kentucky has won almost three and a half times almost four times the the risk of getting cancer and having a poor outcome and by the way little known fact but that we know that women bisexual women are 70 more likely to be diagnosed with cancer than compared to heterosexual women so let's stop thinking about disparities in the terms in the context of this traditional thing we say rule you think white you think the spread is you always think that this is about african-americans or whatever point number one point number two i love science and i believe that what we do from the public health sort of perspective and what we're doing with big data and this is why the big data thing will matter because i actually do think that we're moving towards now a third sort of movement in the context of our awareness of the power of data we started with the power of matter and energy we moved to the power of understanding the human cell the nature of the human cell and now i think data will be important i say that with a pause because sometimes in our excitement of the science remember quick watson and franklin came up with photo 51 and we understand dna um and we kept then we i mean that science really then unleashed uh a whole host of things but by 1951 we had a woman named henrietta lacks now when henrietta lacks in 1951 checked into the hospital she didn't know she had cervical cancer but she did and she passed away that's not the story the story is dr gay george k from johns hopkins we know this henrietta lacks in the mortar cells of henrietta lacks and all this stuff but it's not so much that george gay from johns hopkins at the time um successfully uh i was able to um actually take hemolax's cells and have them immortalized and we got the gila cell et cetera et cetera that's not what i'm worried about i'm worried about the blind spots within our science the the blind spots of humanity within our science when we unleash right probably one of the biggest findings in science that transformed the way we did science we also at our worst in thinking of the humanity around that scientific impact on communities now let's not get twisted dr gay didn't just take henrietta cells and that was the first one you probably know that there were at least 30 40 attempts before you had henry relax in creating um this immortalized cell what's the big deal you might say well the big deal is as many of you know jonas sark many other big pharma companies uh and those people who were clever enough to figure out what to do with these cells certainly did a lot and in fact it's not that i am discounting that science but hear me out for a second those families the descendants of those people who created those cells and learned how to do big pharma things with those cells benefited by having resources brought to their table as a result of their you know of their mom or their dad or whoever else who owned those companies finding these things with these cells right the descendants of the descendant of the descendants benefited financially and yet henry de lax and her family but you're on the verge almost of uh essentially just struggling for every little set and just trying to make a living benefited not at all now listen i'm not trying to say we shouldn't do science but there should be an awareness that every time we come up with quote scientific progress we inadvertently increase disparities now so many arguments what are you talking about but i would dare and even put every cent that i have in my pocket right now on the table and show me when there was a a movement for scientific progress that it didn't inadvertently create a disparity whether you're talking about with the advent of the mammography or colorectal screening i say this because we are on the verge now of data big data and the intersectionality of what that data will have on impact on our communities and i say to you that whenever there is numerical drugs whenever there is numerical uh uh technology whenever there's a numerical concept let's try to do something different than introduce an inverted disparity and be much more conscious about the equitability why is this matter because precision medicine immunotherapy data all of these things are our tools just like what they were doing in the 1950s but 1960s with new technologies like mammographies and all the rest of these other things in the 70s et cetera et cetera we are at a at a moment right now that our new discoveries may also inadvertently if we're not careful introduce disparities this is just an example of breast cancer mortality i'm just giving you some seer data just to look at the winding gap between african-american women and uh caucasian women in the context of breast cancer deaths and i'd submit to you that in large part you can go back to the initial um discovery of the mammography and start seeing where the lines start to separate when it comes to screening this is the national cancer screen trotting doesn't when it comes to the actual therapy you know we we act as if you know uh you know that uh the immunotherapy and all these things where again has driven sharp declines in cancer mortality overall but dr brawley and others actually also noted that there was also an introduction of an immunotherapy divide we talk about artificial intelligence again as a major tool as data as being this next just like we talked about matter and energy just like we talked about the science of the uh understanding now the nature of the human cell we talk about these things in similar terms we're talking about our new technologies and data but the buddies they may be great tools but if they're not equally distributed we still often expand our disparities here's an example this is an example from one of my uh um one of my colleagues dr choices who took a picture of one of the hospitals on the south side of chicago and in the face of talking about artificial intelligence and all these other things that's clearly just down the road it's on the south side of chicago you have a hospital with an active manhole and everyone's covering up their nose because of the smell in there but by the way they're not rigid without reading anything from an artificial intelligence to these dots are just trying to make it with an analog we need to stop playing more than 62 percent of oncologists say you've got a group of 10 000 oncologists and you're just asking general questions it's not about how they take care of people but in general how does the field take here i just want you to pay attention to that 62 percent of oncologists this is a pull taken by the nccn and acs cans 62 percent of oncology says that when it comes to health outcomes they believe that their patients of color did worse than their white patients i understand that covet did a lot and everyone's covet fatigue but let me just reaffirm for you that covert did a couple things for me in addition to exposing and and and um i wouldn't you know uh the issues around disparities and issues around uh social justice etc but let's not forget that this is actually on repeat mode in 1918 the flu pandemic of 1918 knocked off roughly uh 675 000 people uh and really at that point america was uh substantially smaller so it's about 100 million people told but let's not forget that during that period of 1918 in 1921 that you had some of the worst racial incidences in the country lynching the tulsa incident where literally you lost hundreds of african-american lives not because anyone did anything but just they happen to be african-american elaine arkansas which you lost almost 200 lives in a period of 48 hours just simply for them being black so these are not new issues this is my point as we talk about health disparities as if we continue to rediscover health disparities let it be known that this probably was best framed in 1899 by one of the greatest social scientists of his time w.e.b du bois in what was called the philadelphia papers so why i am often moved of this new rediscovery and reconnectedness with health disparities let's not play as if these things are just there and have been discovered today and let's not just act as if we're writing and discovering new findings about it come on y'all work is actually also over the last 50 years has been done about not just identifying and friend working the issues and clearly it's more nuanced now we can talk about the digital dividing but the four principles of disparities have been there and written and documented and interestingly enough the course solutions were awesome by many blue ribbon panels and particularly through the watts and the scene of watts riots and all the rest of stuff in the 60s and 70s and in fact there were things even put in place that were shown to be working that would then subsequently dismantle this year-round disparities isn't one in which we don't know this is a little bit like a diet i tell everyone it's when you know we all know that being overweight the consequences of that we know the benefits of actually losing weight and pretty much i think that's universal we also know that there's probably 10 to 20 000 diets and we know by the literature that if you what if you stick and commit to one almost all of them will have you lose weight the issue for us and particularly the issue for us and academics is that we've been very good at framing the problem we've been very good about re announcing the problem we've been good at times about potentially coming up with solutions but when it comes to the implementation and the actual commitment somehow we can't get our act together and there's a lack of will so this concept about health disparities we don't know what it is and it's difficult to come up with solutions i actually think that we need to stop that crazy talk blow off some of the things in the uh and the structures that we had put in place before and ask the real questions about what and how do we implement these things in a sustainable manner and yeah i don't want to spend a lot of time we know that even in our own field there are blind spots and always haven't been many you know back in uh in april 21 march april 21 the the hubbub that came because you know one of our colleagues said something uh um you know from jama you know on one of the podcasts about uh physicians can't be racist and all the talk about structural racism just as making white people and alienating white people come on y'all when you think back to many of the other earlier studies man engineering sins and the issues of using african-american slaves because he thought that they didn't experience pain and as a result of not experiencing pain would develop the repair fistulas uh again the father of modern-day you know gynecology surgical gynecology right use these things to the benefit of others as we think about issues within the context of as people like to call the tuskegee institute well i refer to it as the united states public syphilis study of 1932 where clearly the use of african-americans to understand the natural history of syphilis was not to benefit african americans but simply to benefit others let's stop playing and by the way it is interesting to me particularly in public health at the very moment where we are in basic science and basic translational science and a lot of my work even though it's you know certainly has developed around the public sphere still is focused on a lot of rna binding protein and protein methylation but let us but it's interesting that we can have such a wonderful conversation about at the individual cell level cleaning all the information from one epithelial cell one individual cell but we can't do the same for people in fact it was mean abyss on joan ruby at some point who pointed out to me who were wonderful scientists at the time who pointed out to me that the epithelial cell because there was an epithelial cell biologist was not just you know getting disrupted on its own there was an information going back and forth between the stroma which we used to think was in earth but that stroma that surrounded these epithelial cells we're having conversations back and forth that influence the epithelial cell to become a cancer cell that concept of the genome impacts the cell well i submit to you that individuals actually also have a stroma that's almost called the community there is communication before between the community and that individual that ultimately allows that individual to grow or not this is clearly a native term i've just made it up but the genome impacts the cell as the xeno impacts the individual i think it's time that we start thinking about place and space and the concept of as i've talked about the concept of zip code neighborhood of association ie your zna and the impact it has on the dna in your biological outcomes when i think of dna i think there's examples right here in chicago or you can pick detroit or anywhere else the life expectancy um in this area high area of um of wealth is called the loop that loop uh what is is where you know keanu reeves or oprah winfrey or others would actually go to uh and hang out beautiful facilities beautiful gyms beautiful access to the lake and working out and fresh foods et cetera et cetera the life expectancy there was uh 85. the crazy thing is when you go four and a half miles west the life expectancy drops to 16 and when you go literally eight and a half miles south of the loop in an area called englewood it drops down it's reduced by 30 years now listen i know some of you are saying dr nguyen come on man you know you know listen it's chicago it's you know it's like detroit this clearly is related to gun violence and all this other stuff you would be wrong those things are factored in it turns out that they're negligible in explaining the life expectancy differences now one might actually argue that this is just unique to places like detroit or this is unique to places like uh you know chicago or up in dc but you would be wrong we know that the stressed rural counties uh throughout the appalachians and particularly in areas like kentucky the eastern side of kentucky you can see in some cases an 18-year life difference between someone living in lexington versus someone living in beeville kentucky place matters for a very long time academic cancer centers like mine have focused rightfully so on the fundamental research and in the impact of the downstream factors but i think that if we've learned nothing else through this pandemic and through this issues that we've been having posterior floor it's that we must also pay attention to those upstream determinants of health many tag those the social determinants of health and i think we've been doing a better job in trying to through the national care and policy form of bringing attention to the impact of food insecurity housing and things like transportation i think we've been doing a better job of understanding of how we know that for example i think the american cancer society put out that the having uh the lack of transportation accounted for more than four to five million people not getting the quality care that they should be getting but i want to stop the hashtag social determinants of health conversation right now social determinants of health didn't just happen social determinative health were created by policies economics and politics of their time let's start with homer hoyt graduate from university of chicago who came in uh to be the head of the uh federal housing act of 1934 which was you know you know fdr's way of getting people back in the homes i mean it's been through tough economic times this plan was to say you're right we should get people back into homes but we have to do it in an orderly fashion omaha was also a man of his time and his thesis was essentially what would later be called the concept of redlining now you've probably heard in new york times people talk about well redlining and the issues of that are still impacting um you know minority communities today but let me just take you through this about why i am trying to get people to get out of this concept that blacks just tend to be quote more predisposed or that there's something innately more uh you know biologically set up for them to have cancer let me stop you right there and say let me take you through the next couple slides to tell you why i stopped that conversation several years back also let it be known that the act of redlining was set up on the pseudoscience and the best science of the time of eugenics so what does this slide say if you look at the slide the areas that are in the red slash pink and yellow were the areas in which people could not get home loans these were considered to be the undesirables the areas pictured in the green green and the blue are the areas that were considered to be well worth giving folks home loan now the interesting thing about this is that it broke down race turns out that dr hoyt had come up with a way based on eugenics that being being that whites and blah blah blah these various groups would give back the money based on a soft science right that you know whites would certainly give back the money so that blue and green areas where the concentration whites were in this case 1935 that was considered the west side of um richmond and the east side of richmond which is a concentration of african-americans is to this day it breaks down even in 2022 that there is an east side predominantly uh populated by african-americans in the west side predominantly populated by caucasians in sanctioned segregation but it wasn't the sanctioning of segregation that at the end of the day did in many of these communities in fact despite the redlining issues making african-americans in virginia and even in detroit actually profited better than we had what was called the black wall street here in jackson war which is now called gilpin court this jackson wall was considered to be the home of the south they had their own banking their own commerce their own food but it was the urban renewal that impacted michigan the urban renewal that impacted virginia the urban renewal that impacted many of the um uh states and cities within our country where we were deliberately building white roads through black bedrooms that ultimately devastated many of these communities that devastation was then augmented and enhanced by the placement of many industries that ultimately were placed in these non-desirable areas that contributed to more hazardous air and by the way if you weren't counting as a result of we know that the diesel fume and i think this is worked by vicki seaworld and many others out in california they're looking completely at um the issue of exposure to diesel fuel but i want to take you back to dr tessum from university of illinois who has shown before all this conversation has come up that particular matter 2.5 which is associated with cancer by the way is disproportionately systemically affecting people of color in those areas we know this is an example of baltimore that the issue of the urban heat is where we know that the poorest areas are in areas where the heat right is substantially higher in some areas as much as 78 degrees and that that results also in chronic disease this is a picture of an example of an urban heat island as i showed you in 1935 the east side of richmond which was then called jackson what we still have jacksonville what's called gilbert is pictured on your right the eastern the west end still there is about a five to six point different degrees in temperature and we're starting to get even more hip to the fact that these urban heat these why do i say this i want to tell you this because we need to stop this crazy talk that it just so happens that black are just more you know more predisposed to cancer and they just biologically this is a croc that needs to be not entirely wrong in a sense that i believe that there's certainly things that we know through science around the contribution maybe twenty percent to different genetic issues but let's not forget that the dna this zip code neighborhood of social xenon actually also plays a role in impacting our dna and our biological outcomes that's not frequently accounted for in many of our papers which can give us false things about how african-americans may be more predisposed and i wish uh dr brawley were here to talk about that we probably should go back and look at this issue around triple negative breast cancer by the way when we talk about african-americans being more uh you know at risk of triple negative breast cancer and again the data we need to probably go back and look at that we don't even talk about ancestry talk about black as if it's a thing as opposed to the social construct it was work done by lisa newman has pointed out that if you're african-american but have predominantly more eastern african descent or ancestry your outcomes and triple negatives are better than if you are a woman and you know black african-american with west african ancestry and the same can be said probably if we were to look even closer in what we call quote white this is a time where we shouldn't be afraid of data this is a time where should be able to grapple obviously with the um difficulties and the messiness with the science to get better and by the way there makes no sense to me why as we're talking about data that we are so afraid of small area analysis with all the machine learning and with all the ai with all these other things funny going on and i got it garbage in garbage out but you can't convince me that we're at a point right now where we still can be comfortable talking about we have negligible populations this is why they're not measured dr weiner and i just recently wrote something in trends in cancer really comparing urban rural and understanding that to be honest with you desperate groups really do share a commonality in some cancer disparities and it's not just a black white thing it's a place a space thing and as i'm winding up and i'll be finished in a second the reality is we too have to worry about this issue of trust i have to say to you that i am certain that we'll continue the onslaught of in the progress of scientific research and our new cures and our new technologies but what i'm not certain about is that we will maintain a public trust many of you read articles like this where the health system grows wealthier while its neighbors stay sick you can put any of us there but the crazy part is even in the face of having a miracle an mrna vaccine that we know is probably the best vaccine ever we were patting ourselves on back as public health officials as academics about how we would wonderfully came together did this and yet when it came to a public trust we understood that some people just simply didn't care if you look at public trust data from the 70s and 80s and 90s there's a consistent disconnect and reduction of the connectedness and the trust that our public has for us in our science we're gonna have to do something about that this is an attempt for me to be able to do that we're doing mercer haynes and uh pastor todd gray from the historic fifth street baptist church got together and formed a because it turns out that right at the very beginning of covid it dawned on me that people weren't listening to doctors and people weren't listening at all to our scientists but this partnership of a doctor a lawyer and a pastor did work in fact we've been added every friday from three to four eastern standard time where we are disseminating information with the likes of having both external experts like dr fauci and the first lady but also we've had really um bringing information local folks so that they can actually come back and talk i'll end up with this that it turns out that building trust for our community said that you know they there are three things important relevance accessibility and flexibility but the crazy part is all of us in academics say the following what's not measured is not done yet well how come we're not measuring at all or having frameworks for institutional trustworthiness we continue to talk about building trust and yet we have no management metrics when we turn the mirror back on ourselves of our institutional readiness or institutional trustworthiness dr ruben tudor and i are starting to put some work on that and so i actually am a big fan of the responsive research era right in cancer centers we talk about this as a catchment area and what we're responsible to and i'm convinced that we should continue to put emphasizing discovery science but you can't convince me that as much as we actually are also focused on discovery science that we can't add delivery science health sciences to that the implementation scientist to that as a balanced portfolio this is not an argument of more money going discovery less money knowing it this is an argument of not an ore but an end and by the way we talk about genomics epidemics all the ominous phenomics but there is a missing omnic it's called the elements of the community or the community that is frequently missing in our discussions that i think we're going to need to use our data and yes as messier as is i'm more excited about the messiness that i am turned off by and we're trying to do big programs in the context of different strategies and different ways of using more precise ways of getting the data to actually have interventions uh including our work with sas um about creating what we call uh uh areas in which we're able to look backwards and figure out over the last 10 years what the errors look like and you know do some calculations but more importantly being able to do some predictive analysis for i'll end with these next two slides ralph abernathy um right on the eve of the apollo 11 launchers the first time we were going to place a man on the moon made such a ruckus and for those who don't know ralph abernathy he was with martin luther king whoever shows a big civil rights person they made such a ruckus that the folks from nasa had to say could you please just send somebody out there and keep these guys from from doing this ralph abernathy said to uh dr thomas paine who was then the deputy of nasa listen i'm not anti you're putting a man on the moon in fact i'm fascinated by that we support that we applaud that we understand that the the miracle that you're about to do and the value of it to all of us as americans but i just have one question why can't that same attention being paid to issues around poverty in my communities and thomas paine without missing the beat said famously reverend amanathi because it's easier to put a man on the moon than it is to address these issues well in 2022 it seems to me that it's easier to put our neighbors into space than it is to address those issues and it's disappointing because in the words of fred and reads of john john f kennedy right we put the man into space not because it is easy but what is it because it's hard and yet every time we talk about small air analysis every time we talk about addressing these issues around equity in our neighborhoods we talk about the difficulty of it well i'm tired about talking about the difficulty of it and i think that this is a call to action for all of us to bring our best to the table to figure out how we can start making through the power of data and other things making differences and so with that i'll stop i know i've probably overstayed my welcome but i wanted to say uh thank you uh for giving me the opportunity to come back home and talk to you all uh at michigan i uh i went to med school there i'm always you know and my heart's always with michigan so again thank you for the invite to coming back to share some of the work that we've been doing thank you thank you so very much if people want to write any questions and chat please go ahead and i can read your questions or if if anyone has a question here in person please just raise your hand we'll pass the mic that's a lot in the morning i tried to stay off the coffee just to make sure i wouldn't get too amped up or if anyone wants to just unmute yourself and and ask a question you're welcome to do that as well i i can go hello dr wynn um i also heard you speak last week at case western and wanted to thank you for being so honest and um i don't know what word to use other than um outright frankly challenging the structural racism that exists in policies that actually not only exist previously but even today when policies are made policymakers are sort of blind to how racism informs their policy making so i was wondering how do you think um you know people like us and and i've noticed that this is a an increasing conversation amongst academic circles about how we have to step out of our academic silos to take this conversation more into the public space um you know all the research is there we know how this works but how do we actually make real change and i'm somebody who's very politically interested my degree is in law and public policy and now i'm working in a very academic research space doing research in on disparities and cancer outcomes the worlds are just so separate and there's existing um uh i guess hurdles that are institutional at times to uh sort of navigate that gap like you you can't for example uh easily invite politicians or policymakers to these kinds of spaces without going through appropriate channels so i'm wondering how do you think and i know that this is a tough question um how how do we do this like how you know we're almost working in a bubble right now like all of the people on this call i imagine we all sort of to a certain extent understand how uh disparities are informed by all the isms and the terrible things that we see in society so how how do we step out of this bubble and how do we talk to people who are you know we're living in an increasingly polarized world where you know the moment we talk about this stuff we're labeled as woke which is now an insult so what what do you think like how how how do we do this yeah so thank you for that question um i'd like to start off with actually understanding the people that as academics our world has also changed in the 1950s you didn't have competing institutions like google who are also interested in your data at amazon who are altruists interested in data i think that the playing field has been equal essentially or different or changed for us in academics and the old thinking from the 1950s that of our academic purity that those times have actually slightly shifted just a little bit particularly with the focus on data i'm now moving my institution i've certainly moved my cancer center from my early pursuits of just academic excellence of which i still think has great benefits to a transition towards academic relevance it doesn't mean that we don't uh continue to publish papers or we don't do grants but it does mean that we have to deal with the reality that our world has changed even his academics from here in 2022 to what it was in 1952 and by the way i actually now um and the sas data and all the rest of stuff one of the first things i've done is to focus no longer on zip codes zip codes are data that for me is useful for academics and useful for postman but not usable at all to my doggone communities and i'm transitioning from now the focus on trying to understand useful versus usable data and trying to actually put the usable data in that tranche of what i consider to be academic relevant in an academic relevant approaches what do i mean i now actually calculate all my data's cancer data in terms of voting districts from the smallest ones to the districts you know my councilman council women to larger ones with the state reps state senators to ultimately also by you know the the federal people like the house of uh abigail spanberger or senator kane all of that data now is collected in way people vote why because ultimately when i come up with something i then have to use it to then influence or at least impact knowledge of the people who have the resources and the authority to make change and sometimes when i do the voting districts type issues or voting districts issues or uh what i used to call the war-based approach or the district-based approach it turns out that i have much more solid conversation even with our community hospitals because everyone can define a place in space but when you actually talk about zip codes all of a sudden it allows for people to say it's not my part that's his part i used to have that in in chicago where they would say oh this part is this right well i don't have this part you don't have this part right i started saying let's put playing around and put it into issues of power or units of power of voting and so that's how we're doing all of our things so again that's a great question i can only tell you that we are going to have to be much more aware that if we're not focused on the academic relevance of things and the pragmatism of what we're doing with our academic issues we will be made potentially the possibility of made less and less important because other industries are certainly are doing and capable of doing much of what we are doing these days so again thank you for the question thank you that's probably a tough answer in the morning though no no it was great i particularly really liked you talking about smaller than the zip code unit which is you know some research is happening at that level now um with different kinds of social determinants of health and different kinds of metrics to measure that so it is really interesting to see that you have been using that to um reach out to you know the powers that be to make those uh policy changes so i appreciate the answer a lot thank you you know at some point that here in massey we'll be able to work with folks at michigan that would be so cool to me anyone else have a question yes i'll ask one question before we move on um so what would you say is the um if you could just say one thing that you think um you know data scientists people who aren't involved in um community research not because they don't want to be but because they don't have the skills to to do it you know their training was like myself you know math statistics um what's the one thing that we can do um to to help this situation yeah i'd say there's two quick things one involves courage the courage to understand that these things are messy and that while you want data that is totally validated and how you want data that's completely stable that we run the risk sometimes of not being in the message on the fringes and trying to control for that as best as possible but we run the risk of having communities in detroit or communities on the south side of chicago says what does your data mean to me i already know we poll we've been that way for 30 40 years so what's different the other thing is the courage to actually start picking out of the box and bringing new voices to the table as you are creating your thoughts as we think about data scientists this is an area in which i look that while we have uh you know lack of disparities in in lots of ways and diversity this is an area where have been our national local regional efforts in trying to bring about diverse voices into the pipeline of the data sciences and the reality is the third thing is i've challenged my folks at illinois and i'll challenge my folks here in virginia that particularly our data scientists and engineering academic what's the pipeline and the exposure you have to the things that you're measuring going into community sometimes actually will change a lot i had one of my engineers once said you know rob thank you for taking me out to take them on the west south side thank you for taking me in the west and introducing and talking to community members because all of a sudden what i thought was a great idea is not very practical because it will not be used because in addition to what we come up with behaviors matter and so we i would say is my grandmother the only two things i know is grace and humility and a little bit more courage and a lot more humility from our data scientists and our academics i think it's really needed for us to propel uh what we i believe have the power to do to move that forward thank you yeah i think we can all encourage our collaborators or try to collaborate with people who are doing things like using voting districts as opposed to zip codes or or not even thinking about these things at all so i think yeah that's something we can do so um any last any last question because i i think we're a few minutes behind the schedule right listen i know i'm wearing y'all it's the beginning of the morning so i apologize for that no no thank you thank you so much thank you dr nguyen it's absolutely fabulous to have you back here at university of michigan thank you thank you
