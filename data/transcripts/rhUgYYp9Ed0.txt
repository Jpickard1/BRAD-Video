[Music] so if they're playing guns and they don't what how are they going to come otherwise that's great technology seminar series I think you've all been here before so I don't think I read the explanation and brian has walked in I'm sure that this is a timely doc you know this very curious to hear what Eric say since he's got so much experience in this like everything else is cited today this AI word certainly over height you know taking over the frontal cortex of some of our leadership we're gonna do about AI in this and the eye on that and yeah I you know put your shoes on in the morning so I think it'll be fun to hear from Jerry I've worked with him for many many years it's research professor department torts embedded in my laboratory and you know it's a you know it's got a lot of Crowley was a section chief at the you know checking me on this one honor it's been a pharmaceutical company technical executive various places coach or someone you know it's working a bunch of felt and you know and it's it applying the regulome to the pharmacogenomics so go ahead okay thank you for heads-up me yeah hello so yeah I was gonna sit down but you know it's probably not appropriate so this is not really a tools and technology talked so any of you anyone that came for that can leave slow ok no this is more a overview and applications talk so yeah I meant to do this because for some reason out of desperation I was asked to give workshops at the end of this month and at biodata West which is next month in San Francisco on kind of the foundations of artificial intelligence as applied to drug discovery this month and next month is more about the regular and AI so well good I'll force myself to learn something about this domain right molecular forces even think yeah but I didn't think to heard about this look but anyway so let's I push a button ah so I'm going to talk a fair amount about drug discovery and it's so the data associated with that a little bit very a little bit of small piece about competitive space and growth rate and then very brief examples of few applications and people welcome to ask questions although obviously if we get bogged down for half an hour we'll never get anywhere but that's fine too so here's just some definitions from Wikipedia machine learning deep learning unsupervised versus supervised unsupervised is where the data are unlabeled the people all know this I assumed in this department people would know sort of what these were generically and I got just touch on a brief collaboration that I had with a fellow at MIT Vikash on probabilistic computing using one of his approaches or one of those pieces of software called Bayes DB okay so this is from a deck from last year's bio-data West courtesy of Jeff Dean at Google brain and this is sort of what was going on in the 80s and 90s which I can relate to because I was at Roche one of the things I was overseeing was something in Roche image analysis systems where we were made of making an automated papsmear image recognition system and for digital pathology if that makes sense to try to find cancer cells in a pap smear and at that point this has a lot of resonance for me because the neural networks weren't really sophisticated enough to be able to operate like they're doing now and we had to use algorithmic approaches and we could never equal the accuracy of an actual pathologist looking through a microscope which is sort of the standard you have to meet or exceed for FDA approval and so anyway now that's no longer the case although its accuracy on the y-axis scale data size model size on the x axis but of course that requires more confusion at the time and I like the slide because it's kind of reinvigorates my interest in Bayes DB and probabilistic computing which some people here may know about or not this is again from Jeff Dean who by the way is I shouldn't I'm making a plot to make a political statement I shouldn't do that here let's say some of the people from our computer science engineering program are going out to his group for fellowships in social so obviously machine learning makes computers that are software that's able to learn and his point here I think was actually programming software or computer to be clever is harder than programming a computer to learn to be clever or software on each other and so this is more false until aroma but I thought at the end which is a little tiny bit about probabilistic computing [Music] now this is my inaccurate a somewhat inaccurate history of drug discovery so I don't know if you you folks probably Jeff knows about this and will correct me I'm sure without any hesitation but you know a lot of serums serum based off prior to about 1910 and vaccines so all these things just because they're I have arrows up here doesn't mean they're not continuing over time obviously polio vaccine was until later but this whole period of rationale so-called rational drug design we sort of had some notion that you had a target and at least a simple mechanism and you would use that target and design a small compound around that and that poop did be very good until it stopped working there were no new drugs and kind of productivity and everything fell and you can give me a feedback if you of course we've been when the human genome was sequenced there was all this wonderful optimism about okay now we know gene so we can do a single gene to drug screening approach and this is the sort of the era when monocle antibodies drugs attend an AP you know these guys and then the other drugs that and an IB which are intracellular inhibitors I'm sorry they began to be emerge I had talked about a little bit about this these two in a bit and then there was a there's been a focus more recently on gifts of nature that is large familial pedigrees in which you find the pedigree itself is somewhat rare but you can sort of identify what the molecular problem is and figure out then you can figure out maybe this is a druggable mechanism  that makes sense and so this is kind of target based therapeutics I'm going to focus on this which is molecular mechanism clinical indication based target pairs which is a these are kind of buzzword things in pharma and so we're starting to air after the era of deep learning for drug discovery which I think Alex K back there says what is really good discovered yet which is a good question to put out there and then maybe finally intelligent machines or real artificial intelligence like the last slide but a software and computers are sort of autonomous in some manner I guess wearables yeah wearables and they're on a coming slide these logical measurements right yeah it's more automated just a couple of things down here companion diagnostics were really touted at the early part of this century but they have not really flourished like the FDA had hoped they would but it's starting around 2013 they become more common especially in oncology and of course Brian AP and I have been volved with a company that was doing pharmacogenomics Diagnostics in psychiatry with us quite successful Asher X now part of myriad genetics so any questions or I know this is inaccurate if you want to yeah what I thought there's a lot of truth not actually but so um if you do use machine learning or deep learning there's a subset of it what should use as what data should use as a training set so I can spend some time on this because this is a a somewhat onerous challenge for pharmaceutical drug discovery and you I guess here where we should all be aware that we now have things in more broader landscape of healthcare that can do especially based deep learning applications that can perform digital radiology better than a pathologist and can do some digital radiology better than a radiologists of course those clinical specialties have not agreed with this necessarily you know but it's been shown pretty objectively okay so also optimal in ophthalmology yeah so there was this original sort of rational drug design focused off and around catalytic pockets and enzymes receptors drug transporters and then then there's kind of a switch to well we now have genes so maybe we could just design drugs around single genes that might have some kind of consequence but they most of those failed in clinical trials John prisoners buddies came up with this on their genic model which was post quite recently suggesting that there were core genes that should be used as are their products should be used as targets but there are a lot of peripheral teens in which variants had relatively small effect sizes I guess you've seen these I'm off you ever seen these XY charts with six balloons or spheres on them and I will find the ine showed one that we looked at the other day mnd lien disorders that are large effect size and rare well in work done by re allen foyer looking at his computer and the paper we published as well as Lillian Lang I've shown that actually pharmacogenomic effect sizes from genome-wide Association studies are pretty large compared to disease risk snips and you know snips are not just necessarily a single they exchange they can be a small insertion or deletion Lisa corner according to definition I think it's still active from NCBI or non severely did not library medicine let me throw in one another one that for you to do everybody in you especially to consider here is that charming Wang and someone who's new his new company you know you know especially in oncology to avoid the resistance that what somebody might have you know you throw a cocktail of various compounds our instance pathway I'm gonna talk about oh good not about his work specifically but yeah that's a pro se I think that's that's an approach that's lends itself if you look at this that's really about molecular network loci dick so you're you're drugging various parts of a molecular pathway that makes sense yeah so then david batchelor who was at the Broad Institute found that if you look at these natural gifts that occur later again these familial pedigrees you can find these families sort of I go back to when I'm is from the mother Disease Foundation Huntington's disease NASA Wexler and her father where they used I think pedigree from like Mara Bauer or someplace like that in South America that had familial Huntington's disease which is how they find them just discovered what the I think the cause was I know they did although I don't think it's yet druggable anyway the point being he showed that for product of a gene sen 9 that there are various kinds of pain disorders associated with mutation in that gene thus making a good candidate for drug film and i'm gonna go on to this a little more detail then we have work from josh originally from josh denny and collaborators at vanderbilt using feet and wide Association studies in which they've identified of course Vanderbilt in I hope you I don't know if that's still extant to you it's I be displaced by their they still have the backwardly archive file view how they still are populating by up you with dirty okay so one of the things that came out of this is that they show the drug response and disease or experience often cluster within the same regulatory pathways and we've also shown this with lithium in a paper we published and then even more recently a lot of big pharma again go into this and some deal have formed these relationships outside of the United States some inside the United States with mostly with other countries where they can access a combination of clinical data from like an electronic health record on patients as well as genotype data or even genome genomic sequence data or expression data which in the u.s. is hard to because of our privacy laws so anyway I'm going to talk about this a little bit and then fine I'll show one sort of slightly in Episode II but anyway we're though at all published in 2009 what they predict that when they looked at drugs of Rorty in phase three trials would be eventually approved and thus successful and those which would knock hmm and then they course published a follow-up paper showing that their predictions in silico using machine learning were very successful anyway I'll show you that as well any questions okay really quickly um this is a from a talk I gave at Ewa the day the the CEO was fired if they took over Cephalon which is a company started by Frank ball Deena was not dead but was a kind of a colleague of mine and so their US headquarters is in Westchester Pennsylvania Entebbe I think they're the largest they're their headquarters are in Israel but they're the largest generic drone company in the world and by the way it's spelled pronounced ABBA not Teva so if you go get pills and the pharmacist says you want tiba mus they get really mad about this anyway so what was interesting is he found these families that had these different mutations and this is very severe pain if you look I don't know if you ever gone through the doctor and seeing you know like well they have this chart of one to ten and then they'll have phases that are go from relief right this is my leg this is actually turning out to be a big deal and I've got researchers and midis looking this and if you really want to get blown away log on to the real-time Twitter feed of emojis career on the Internet they'll it'll shock you these are criminal major disease they're actually emojis are going to turn out to be very important and reporting things back into the for Healthcare Research people so he found these familial pedigrees and this is severe pain and your skin turns red and stuff this is not a severe so you can look at the function of this channel which is encoded by the SCN 9a gene and then look at the pain phenotype and it's all good no pain disorder wild-type here and why this person isn't smiling it's because they're actually insensitive to pain which is not a good thing to be so actually they should be frowning but anyway so he proposes so he found this and this is sort of the Nadia of the gifts of nature family pedigree means finding variants and then developing drugs around them so let me go another slide so this is the SCN 9:18 and there are at least two drugs in phase 3 for AXA for gene I'm off that's right way to pronounce it and Jeff who comes up with these programs you know there must be a brand marketer guys they also have to have letters that make them so they won't be confused with things and they have things I know that right so the pharmacist won't think they won't give you the schedule to opiates aspirin remarked officer so they don't get sued anyway so this in this for severe fibromyalgia which actually has a different clinical name now there's a Mexican female pedigree sorry go ahead sleep there see if someone worries at this point I Kenny you tell me was gonna be really so that was kind of neat because these show the promise although they're not yet fda-approved so that you know moving forward so a lot of Big Pharma I'm gonna get there you can see some of the partnerships down here between various companies and some of the this is the u.s. geisinger Health System that people may know is a very progressive health group is it in it's in Pennsylvania they they do a lot of genotyping and stuff we generally work with them but roses not working with Estonia electronic health record tellers work with Finland engine with the code so these are sort of the sort drugs that have are either in phase 3 or approved and of course to me what's interesting because I wrote a paper with Hardy about amyloid cascade hypothesis in 92 because it looks like the new generation the various newest ones are effective and this one I know has received just received breakthrough status analysis disease late onset so for me that's kind of neat anyway um and for anyone that house Alzheimer's disease in the room might be good you know but um like me so this is that paper from there's a 2009 paper from the zoo at all I hope I'm pronouncing correctly and then a folde paper and in trends and pharmacological sciences in 2017 and they use machine learning back then ah support vector machines of DNA sequence feeling human phenotype and known properties of muck your target mechanism and they then prospectively predicted what drugs were currently in Phase three would be successful ie approved by the FDA and which ones would not okay this is 2009 based on their results from machine learning now there's a small in here as you can see but the ones so these are the ones they said were promising these ones and say we're not promising based on machine learning of a whole bunch of variables they were pretty good at predicting which would be approved by the FDA and also pretty good at showing her that drug silver in Phase three would probably be would go backwards in terms of going to an earlier trial or discontinuing all together so Gerry there was there's a lot of different data yeah they had a lot of different variables on a data and they were looking for you know these support vector machines actually there's a memories of them just looking for you know variable by I mean the N is quite small and I think those like Alex can women would probably take a lot of issues with this paper for the data that in the data that was collected in phase one or phase two like the tax data something available it's all very long so yeah so it's not like it gets well this is a point coordinate not like I'm gonna replace all the working phase water face to it so no no this is this is interesting because well I'm getting there though okay go ahead you wanna from Missouri tonight I mean I asked a question yeah given that some of what's being talked about here is similarity to existing therapies it might be true from a regulatory perspective that things that are more similar I just hear the Thomas line drug someone to those ears they through based on molecular mechanism clinical interaction target Paras are more likely to be approved by the FDA I agree I'm saying that but I'm saying given that this is the case isn't it likely that to some extent the differentiability the predictive power of what will be approved is largely based on similarity as opposed to what might be effective medically well yeah except but the role of people on advisory boards is um for the FDA is to look for things like adverse drug events and efficacy and now there's of course I don't want to go into this the politics of this because it becomes very thorny very quickly okay but the major support I guess everyone knows in here that the you best Federal Drug Administration is largely supported by its sponsors you know yeah for its sponsors you know big pharma right they count now for about ninety to ninety three percent of the budget so I'm not I'm not I'm not implying anything or you know I'm trying to say anything but anyway so this is just showing four validated pairs that's molecular mechanism clinical interaction target Paris as I've described and this is the percentage of the toll of the 880 currently FDA approved drugs which have been actually approved historically the majority are based on previously validated mechanism indication clearance okay that make sense I mean they're all like that well I mean these guys aren't but the majority of ones that are novel not based on these fail and I'm not going to show that data or those data so this is the second challenge which and I I saw I apologize a lot of text here but if it's true that molecular mechanism and clinical indications you know could be paired from well characterized patient cohorts then wouldn't this provide the ideal sort of training set if you're using deep learning or machine learn excuse me I mean and the problem is how do you gather this data and I've already alluded to that so you know here's a statement from eric lai from takea electronic health record no other bio the air containing replies very silos existing dozen different file formats and distributed among various clinical environments with different cultures and data cleansing often results in data degradation so anyone that's ever worked with electronic health record sort of knows about this anything entre this is amazing to me said noted in December the 227 million Americans or 69% of u.s. population have lost protected health information contained in their electronic health records it's an exact statement I can give you link this obviously a challenger remains a legal problem for hospital administrators but there is an emerging concern about clinical IT professionals at these data cannot be protected even when using applications such as blockchain you know a blockchain is how many people know and then I we go back to this the partnerships between Big Pharma UK biobank Finland Estonia Poland and China where there are few restrictions on patient data but it's sort of ironic that I you know this does not mean that the entire electronic health record of 69% of Americans but that some of the protected health information we should go on the dark web that's real slow I've been told this is from quintiles I'm as health of course they sell the stuff vendors of data analytics will make access to patient data and mandate not a competitive advantage so many companies now are directly excelling comprehensive but aggregated the identify patient data link to snips and genome sequence and these are some examples and I like this statement here and although some Frost and Sullivan which is bhavish marketing or you know forecast groups come a lot of health care products and solutions are focused on one or more steps of a patient's journey however companies like prognosis which is in oncology look at the whole longitudinal care pathway from prevention prediction diagnosis treatment to management the patient and that's I think something that's coming you know puncture some diseases so then I well I found a picture of them because there were so many text slides I thought I got a book live and some people hope that the 40 fall in sleep so this is from last year's biodata West that's fern DiBiase who's head of digital data and analytics platforms for crack so SmithKline the real challenge is not a lack of the data scientists per se and drug discovery and development for the lack of data curators who can prepare and integrate multivariate biomedical data from disparate sources for experimental for pharmacologists and software engineers now I thought that was an interesting statement because a lot of people I talked about that meaning from Pharma told me exactly the same thing it's not the thing anyway so now we come to the scarce item which is the blue unicorn versus which is that Big Pharma cannot find skilled AI researchers you know they're looking for the blue unicorn there very few scientists who are both experimental pharmacologists including you know sub domains of things like medicinal chemistry and such who are also computer software engineers with skills and deep learning a programming so this is kind of looking for the blue unicorn which is a sort of a cliche so Big Pharma has gone to work arounds one is the trained in-house experimental pharmacologist and pewter science I can tell them that's probably not going to be successful that's my own bias but cultivate data curators like from the last slide from the existing pool of scientists act as an interface between experimental pharmacologists and future scientists another is people who prepare the data try to get into format that others who are biologists who have some sort of skill maybe in are and maybe tiny bit of Python but usually not can actually deal with it and then finally to outsource or form partnerships with deep learning companies so you know this is interesting because they were all saying this to me people from Merck GSK from MA from Bose Genentech so you know they start trying to bridge this divide which is not really data science per se or maybe it's a very a variant of it you know i mean i think the our students who are really good programmers and can use deep learning methodology are going to be very successful if they apply at this bar we do have some pharmacology classes and some okay we have one that I've been involved in 601 and 6002 translational pharmacology is one that we put together with dance like eight years ago so we do you know and we looking at that we've got a couple students ER and in the pool of applicants now that this but it's basically you need some far my experience and bioinformatics yeah I know this is actually a pretty good pathway for students who want to work in pharma yeah there's a lot of jobs that ring be brought up you know instant jobs yeah so anyway I thought that would be interesting and I know this isn't really tool and type my kaput it's gonna get even less like that um so this is the competitive space and growth rate part of the talk so these are the top vendors here my deaf I know they're logos that bundle that have you ever heard anyone here heard of real-world evidence not freeze yeah this is an important one and I have not seen you this is actually a serious buzzword and clinical research it is it is and I I see this I'm saying what you know does I mean truth I don't know what the crime is quite what that means but anyway what they mean I think is that they can get patient data and along with some genomic or expression Olmec data and in aggregate bundle these and include them with their analytic platforms like Cerner who's a big electronic health record company blue health intelligence which by the way if you like me covered by the BlueCross BlueShield they're probably taking all of your data and sewing it's all their people I don't know if you have this some form but I think I had to and I didn't even read the stuff that's too long anyway so these guys do that including IBM Watson no this may not be of any interest to you but if you're gonna go out in the world and find a job you gotta realize that while these companies or companies that you could probably get jobs with well I'll put it this way I've had many students who have come to me kind of a demon and they're actually interviewing with these kind of folks and you know they want like a quick kind of mind meld but you know what kind of question might hang on we had several students have gone this way rather that's good I'm running well so it's it's it's really good this is the this is I know this from other people but it's also on this I can give you a link this is currently what these pharmaceutical companies J&J I think is the largest now in the world or Pfizer is I can remember but these are you know J&J Johnson Johnson and Sochi Johnson which is the division of at GlaxoSmithKline Sanofi Roche Genentech and Pfizer and these are the their major partners for doing artificial intelligence for drug discovery agency so they've all got a stratified this yeah this is benevolent that's a fine name yeah I guess I want to get rid of that notion that you are most propagated of these robots running down the street killing people and makes me trust them yeah there's Alex Cologne and friend-friend your buddy is in silicon medicine both these companies partner with GSK this company purchased partners with is that these are all the primary partners Sanofi DNS healthcare which I know well from Cambridge Mass is partnering with Rochas genetic did you a I for drug discovery and IBM Watson health of fiber Pfizer Jerry are these deep learning companies independent companies or they ones have now been subsumed by their partners like it's been ever so gently end of January 2018 and I mean I know the people that are the executives this kind of quite pretty well and but I don't I have never heard of this company but anyway so I I know that gns hasn't been acquired by anyone but I'm sure they're making themselves targets for acquisition right if this ever works I mean that's the other thing that is really interesting so well not IBM probably what they're saying is that various companies are lining up with partner yeah and and there are tons of these startups and an artificial intelligence in the sort of biomedical arena you know doing all these different things a certainly deep vision deep learning for computer vision right and radiology and ophthalmology and pathology doing very successful they're also a huge number of them in drug discovery so it's kind of interesting to see they're sort of sorting out along these lines and go pretty quickly and these data probably are not to be believed because they're forecasts from companies who are paid to sell these market research reports Frost & Sullivan compound annual growth rate of AI in healthcare in 2015 to 2020 15% growth and you can see revenue and the growth rate there some of this is obviously forecast per year kegger is compound annual growth rate this is from coherent market market insights or incoherent markinson's value by an end user deep learning and drug discovery and diagnostics and this is global pharma companies which account for the majority of this and this lacks is weird because it's in u.s. millions 250 million 1.5 billion ok y-axis so I mean you should take this with a grain of salt but I've got to tell you and others who ever follow biotech commercially this space been tremendously hot for about a year now I mean hotter than the you know Wall Street index would you believe it's been incredibly hot for investment so you know be interesting to see what happens this is getting back to Brian a thiis question sort of what Mackenzie MIT I call them that because all the people I know at MIT even at the road seem to work closely with McKenzie side they must have some kind of contractors or a preferred contractor status this is about the directory of AI related technology I think this is published in 2016 it's weird because they have these phases they call in the ecosystem but I actually did we did that in the slide because I have a very specific I grew up sort of being a field biologist early on and I don't like people who use the word ecosystem when it's not talking about actual ecological system um like I could call the phases creation survival growth equilibrium decline then these weird they look like buttons he was pushing up fast for them less than a year one or three years three to five years five to ten years over ten years and then they they talk about the only thing that's on the red line is patience warm technology which I don't even know what that is but anyway not my apologies but if you look you can see huge learning science to drug discovery and they say three to five years from 2016 thoughts on this kind of trajectory growth although I think it actually occurred earlier but they have natural language processing obviously another another thing that can be done by machine you know I gotta say that's natural language processing I had dinner with this fascinating guy last night I don't think Santiago Sagara was a data scientists were trying to recruit the easiest and he's an incredible guy young guy and he wrote a paper using a nearest neighbor of word correlations on comparing Christopher Marlowe's work like dr. Faustus lists some of them William Shakespeare's work in prove that Henry the pork was a play that was written collaboratively by William Shakespeare into end of Amara published in the latest edition of the Shakespeare quarterly Wow so I was trying to get him interested in looking at the no diagnosis drug adverse event pairs in our electronic catalog which is we are accumulating 1.3 million new documents a day transcribed notes into our electronic healthcare records I'm either the transcription that we do here or referrals which interestingly and sadly are still coming through our system through paperbacks is problem that's the fact so I would say 85% of our electronic medical record is free text oh really Wow and so there's natural language processing I think it's gonna be real big yeah that would be one that we would watch wearables I'm gonna then line up there AI optimized hardware this is incredible yeah just a measurement is hard yeah so I'll let you make that point but that's something to really watch and the big problem there of course is that it's all a black box and the physicians are gonna be walking around with this damn stuff I have to talk to you today and but it's coming it's gonna it's in the chipsets that are you know coming from Intel in this kind of thing so you know what's it's I you know I don't know I don't really know if they know anything about what they're forecasting anyway there are some interesting things with diagnostic decision support I think I mean geez anyway yeah my son is a graduate student in CS e computer science engineering here and he took a course in natural language processing which he didn't like I'm but anyway one thing I got to tell you so I gave the you know opposite the health minister of China and Hangzhou right after the tea party and the first question from the audience and when I've given the talk in other places in China which I found out yesterday at dinner its it appears is that china is in the process of collecting blood from every page that walks into a hospital coming up to shin-chan and BGR it's tire company yeah you know I did this talk and this was the 1200 hospital executives over out China and you know it's real-time translation and it was kind of a g20 um the first question that came from the audience and the question I always get in China is is the computer gonna replace the doctor by are we getting rid of diverges yeah 5-10 years I mean they want it enough you were sure so we should close what I'm standing there and I said you know I really know reload I was like what are you gonna say no but just but if you look at like the Steinmetz and decision support and some of these things over there what's the doctor and the care provider more generally does is don't just significant we don't actually know how that's gonna play out I think we'll be liable well by the way I think that's a really important question tensorflow it's very important question and that drives a lot about defensive medicine so I was in a meeting in Nashville a couple weeks ago and I shut up in there just a sec and you know we were looking at a product that should detect drugs and you're in your plasma you know what small drops a place and we were saying that there's certain drugs that you simply have to be off of before you get anesthesia and surgery yeah right and so the thought was that we could get that product right into the pipeline with the anesthesiologist and surgeons because there's the payers were just you know there's such a threat of lawsuits because the patient slide the patients forget the patients takes another thing right there not being prescribed they're on opioids or whatever and they're there I'm and they go under you know if you need to kind of seize you they're gonna die so this defensive medicine thing is absolutely real and it's related to that and it's going to drive a lot of this most likely it's going to drive more devices into the hands of physicians and caregivers but they're not going to be prepared for them bring them now how to use them alright anyway a couple examples and I'm not going to sin detail this is from again Jeff's Google brain group what is a molecule molecule look like to machine this is important because he's looking at quantum like your dynamics and this these are very good links I'm not going to go too into this I mean in any detail right now I don't want any time but it's I find it fascinating it's related to things you and I have recently talked both and you know the basic idea and this publication is to use different control in that model to approximately actually to reduce computation time as compared to using other methods so it's a message passing neural network that predicts the quantum properties of an organic molecule I'm modeling computational expense of DMT calculations this is something we did with the cosh treatment resistance the mood disorders this is I'm Brian I apologize for presents is all 127 nominal various from 375 3017 patients is there examples 95 sniffing these are some of the different kinds of data that were used and this is the base TB outcome there's using probable computing with base e be what would be most predictive one being complete predictive of treatment resistance to mood stabilizers you hear some snips and here are some things from the electronic health record that's the guy really smart guy the cosna Singha and finally to end up with Alex isn't looking Alex okay in the back to be very good the one that you wrote with a whole bunch of people from wallam from University of Pennsylvania well yeah I took the heart of it out where somebody I don't think was he was talking about applications for pro discovery like this we just no no this isn't ever been published and emerges on priority okay oh I see yeah I know we did pharmacogenomic yes this is a good review though especially for like deep learning and drug discovery goes into law detail so now I want to get out of this but anyway I'm giving good gracious explosion to give me beyond this month a workshop in AI and drug discovery this novel picture me so I'm trying to find someone who will take my place Ari or Alex or Brian know or anyone else okay I'll wear the nose and glasses and pretend to be Jerry and a beautiful beard you know and they want me to now co-chair the conference this is one of those handsome great things Brian yeah yeah they were insidious and then this one which is in March which I do actually want to go to but I don't most everyone present which is by a data world West which was actually a Google UCSF combo and now it's also involving NASA Ames out in San Francisco I find this conference to be really really good [Music] well these are I can change the jam guys want you can see that and this last one this is from the leadeth latest nature big data needs a hardware revolution were you just talking about this I was I mean in fact they want to mention this group there's a pillow names that teach professor of computer science Sciences dinners with me to recruit faculty and miners and really as interest is new hardware configurations and architectures to accelerate shooting for file applications genomics and so on Marcus is because he's a cool guy like I mean it's an intellectual it's like by I'm tired Chubby's I'm saying I want him to come visit actually I thought Alex you'd be great to meet on your pipeline I think speed it up I wanted to meet yawns ah you know he he is he has methods and architectures and approaches to you know hearing your factor of thousand compute enhance that stuff but you know can take something that would be awesome to take something that's very difficult and put something 50 months like that I really thought to me the thing that I was excited to see theory was that really neat to slide you had but the deep learn on the molecular structures yeah because I watch it I ridgemount like 12 slides I had in my mom I think that's really a fantastic thing because I can definitely see we were talking about this last night at dinner a little bit I mean they're deep learning you know for guys like me you look just like livin for you a space or 15 years I mean you can see when they're looking at those cats you can just see it's supporting a decomposition then a why and you can see all this visual yeah literally with these you know with these see because what I was excited about is if you go back to that one slide that you had you know where you had that great timeline of all the different kinds of the research that's being done back here my sense is that's what's gonna happen it's this and you're looking in the crystal ball you know yeah keep going see um this so-called rational drug design not okay with the small compounds that's the way we used to work Heather Carlson down in the pharmacy school you know we had one of our a couple of our students got pH DS em go ahead mother of all databases may be tossing off got more there so like your mother morning Doug Benson some of our little your students got you know there was a lot of grants NIGMS me and a lot of it was just having to do with Lincoln binding in pockets no like I said you know if you took that kind of approach like for example this mother of all databases we have all these ligands and the three-dimensional structures and we have kind of the three-dimensional structures of all these catalytic binding sites if you coated that up you know and and process that with that deep learning thing you know those vectors would resolve like just like those pictures yeah they do and you would you could you can chant through that whole database and like nothing flat and you could really see how these drugs were binding into those pockets are not in that kind of thing I mean so what I'm saying is that some of the earlier stop is going to get transformed by AI into new stop jackaroo definitely see that yeah it's gonna jump because these pharma companies are still completely wedded to these little technologies and they're looking for new ways to cut it and then most approved drugs are are like you know your chemists they're similar to other drugs and unapproved by the F behavior from that I think this discharge is really worth you know the people mother biggie you know China doesn't have a you know one you know China does thank goodness for that they don't have that Big Sur they have a lot of home mania Mars over there and so there's still a early days when D feels really good there's a lot of it so I think what will happen see what happened in America was that when they on shed the Accountable Care Act came in 2009 we had all the best intentions in the world Trump Friedman whose chair of the learning Health Sciences was second-in-command of that whole thing use the policy what we wanted was we were a 20 percent adoption of Lamar's country was awful you know we got airline industry and all this stuff is fully digitized healthcare was in the dark ages so we say Val well Willa legislate will induce people with incentives and then penalties later on to switch our problem was they only had like two or three choices so we created inadvertently monopolies epic Cerner all grips you know they became monopolies that's but in China I think there's so many different yeah well they're gonna let the market play and then from the top down the government will start killing them off in various ways and you'll end up with a monopoly but you'll have a damn good EMR yeah that's what's gonna happen I hope that's what happens I'm quite convinced it and BGI will be right in the middle there's no question about that so um see because well one thing Jerry Konig didn't say it's certainly true the reason that this so much of its going offshore is because there's been a lot of studies for patients to go through the trials here they cost about $54,000 of patients that they are through the trial phase 2 phase 3 so you know so if you're doing a randomized control trial with a big end you know it's the clinical research study costing 100 million baht so if you go to India or you go to China you know you can get the price by a factor of 20 and by the way a lot of randomized control trials face reason I actually have Samoan likes yours oh that's a problem however we thought about that a little bit Han Chinese right it's 95 percent hot but you know they're gonna they still are going to have different variants and they will respond to drugs and in different ways you know and actually in some ways it's gonna make it easier in the earlier days to do some of this stuff yeah you know I don't know I was asking Steve he's gone if Mark McCarthy's talk that he gave how many people that you may see that yeah what do you think because was awesome it was awesome oh did you you especially on this pallet of stratification of various kinds of titling diabetes is really amazing we're gonna try to get that PowerPoint from Steve that we can send around but I think that would be really really worth looking at you know and they I must say that he's taking some of these they're taking some of these approaches that's why I'm working on so on this off thing that we've talked about you know one question all right okay oh that's great it wasn't great there's a lot of it's a lot of potential for good careers you know it's for the class but
