there on this picture all day here this is anything is bad Schuessler and this is in international it was alright well thanks and iike for for that nice introduction and for giving me the opportunity to be the first percent in this series and the tenants are still gonna keep my day job I think so you talk about math there will be there little math today it will be the only math is for in in the title I guess and what you have in mind for 4d is probably very different from what I meant in my title but we'll see so anyway so our group is very interested in better understanding the regulation or Dino and to that end we have developed a set of techniques that allows us to look at various aspects of gene expression things like the synthesis of RNA RNA synthesis rates the turnover rates of RNA we also can look at the rate of transcription elongation down gene and we can also get some information about promoter usage and the enhancer usage in a genome-wide have the sounds of interest so what I'm going to do today is are going to introduce those introduced these techniques for you give you some examples and I'll give you three short stories these different techniques and if you're find that these techniques may be useful for you let me know figure out a way okay so if you think of transcripts and I think of transcription a little bit like a musical score there's a set of instruction that needs to be read in a in a certain order you have the primary sequence but then you also you have instructions on for the mutation how to play if you play soft or loud or fast or slow and these are sort of epigenetic marks that tell cells whether to really express a gene or will be press a G so when you take a transcript and obviously the binding of a transcription factor to the promoter or enhancer is obviously very important for for regulating transcription and the transcription factor binding and enhancer binding really drives the weight of RNA synthesis which it's kind of 1d or transcription or a gene expression but then you have what happens after the RNA is made you have a time component where things happen to the RNA to process the introns are removed you have maturation of the RNA and then it's subjected to the degradation at some point each RNA has different set points so they they degrade at different rates so so we're very interested in in try to understand it measure this another rate that's important is a way to be elongation and and this makes a lot of it's important for large genes so some genes in our genome it's like one megabit face born little change in the rate of elongation could make a big difference in how fast that transcript is made and then finally we're obviously very interested in how these three aspects of RNA or gene regulation is regulated we have focused with one our techniques on looking at enhancer element usage and now when we think of many types of diseases many types of diseases have defects in regulation of genes and if you have defect in the regulation of gene and the symphony doesn't sound very good but anyway so we have developed these four techniques and I will describe them to you today the first one is called brucy it's this handle of the vein of transcription genome-wide at the blue chase see here we aged RNA to any age we would like it to be and that allows us to look at splicing kinetics the turnover of pollinate the blue DRV seek technique allows us to measure the weight of their transcription elongation on many thousands okay and finally the blue UVC allows us to enhance four reads that's coming off of promoter transcription start site as well as enhance it and the basis of these techniques is is the labeling of the newly made RNA with normal Yura Dean so the first step for all of these techniques is to label the newly made RNA gooey your dean enters cells gets incorporated into the newly made RNA and the next step is to isolate total RNA from your sample and fish out the year you labeled RNA specifically using antibodies magnetic fields so we capture this newly made RNA that was labeled get rid of all the other RNA and then we prepare libraries and then we go over to Bob and he sequence for us and then we get a lot of data back and we have since our data is the different from regular or and IC theta we have been quite a bit of time to develop analysis tools specific specific for our data alright so to just give you a kind of flavor of what what we are seeing with this technique so this is mapping of the newly made RNA and we're looking at one particular gene here and I add for and you see the map so you see the map of the gene here you have an exon you can see the newly made RNA you get a signal throughout the gene even you get from signal half the termination site you're awesome for gene see this divergent upstream transcript so when you see signal on the upper strand that means transcription go from left and right it's on the bottom strand to the left and now if we another thing that people notice obviously it is choppiness and this is sort of inherent from making the libraries is it's a PCR reaction of millions of pieces and as you know when you when you do piece you're some primers some sequences amplify better so so this is very systematic you see that every time we do if you're not aged this rnase we label it for 30 minutes wash out the the PRU label you chase it with your Dean and we do this for six hours so we look at that RNA we made six hours ago what does it look when we pull it out six hours and this is the JC which the color coded so every time we look at something red it's it's the aged RNA so obviously when we aged it or the introns are taken out and we're left with intron and these sequences very unstable and you don't really see them so now they're the relationship with a signal at six hours over the exon to the signal over the whole gene at time zero gives us an indication of how stable this particular RNA is so you get a relative stability this way so this is a fairly regularly middle-of-the-pack kind of stability transcript if you were to look at the first one of the most unstable transcription you have you're hard-pressed to even see the red so this gene is actually transcribed at a fairly high rate when you do steady state or an air you probably don't see very often but the brucy data we see the units actually fairly active yes yes you sum up all the reading from the beginning now you can order this is this is rpm values you can you can compare different genes with each other and this really describes the transcription great and so a lot of people do shRNA and when we do it's shRNA for a target gene we can actually see that it's targeting the stability of the transcript it doesn't affect the transcription rate of the gene and and so here's an example we were knocking down harp and scrambled shRNA at six hour old or an April part it's very stable it's your the excellent here but if you target park with shRNA its stability has drastically reduce the blue here is the nascent RNA sequencing and so the transcription rate of the gene didn't change but the stability of the transcript changed so this is confirming that the northmost good and this is going to be truthful four genes that you look at with micro RNA it's going to target the ability of the transcript not available now if you if you follow so in this example I did zero-hour and then I aged it to six hours what happens if you take samples in between the time course and look at what happens to the introns and the splicing over time and this is a gene it's a large gene it's like 300 kV long and you're going to follow so this is just the rate the nascent RNA technology single throughout the gene now we're going to chase it with your redeem for different periods of time so you're gonna age it and to see what happens so two hours or six hours and this is an unusual dean in that if you follow this intron this is very little happening over time for this intro it still retain at the neighboring introns are going away pretty quickly so so we've done this genome-wide now and we find gene where multiple intron and the weight of intron removal or the signal in the intron are very different and when you go back to the original read you can determine whether this intron was not spliced or if it was spliced but some reason that intron escaped degradation and so we have examples throughout the genome or both of those cases certain intron number of introns are very poorly life while some are supplied but the intron for whatever reason it's retained it doesn't turn over so potentially there might be some time non-coding RNA function the introns and and ugly interesting now we can also use an inhibitor of general splicing this is a drug called neomycin and this is just again the normal rate of transcription in control if you treat cells for six hours with me on my fandom block splicing genes can still transcribe this is a little bit of a surprise to us we thought that in order for for RNA polymerase to elongate down the genes and synthesized RNA it needs to have things behind it spliced correctly but obviously that that's not the case you get pretty much the same amount of transcription going on even though splicing is inhibited it's a little bit less in the end of the tram now if we chases RNA over time to see if spicing takes place it's really nothing taking place so this very effectively blocked like maybe notice that it seems like being degraded from the end here and that's something that we're currently investigating now I'm just going to show you one more thing this is data we got this morning so I don't know the biology of this but it's just another thing to to you know to what our techniques can do and since we're looking at strand-specific data so this is the data we did we did an experiment with control and hypoxia cheat itself and we know that hit one alpha is a major target for hypoxia we didn't know much about the transcription of this team but this is under control condition this gene is nicely transcribed we get a nice lead from from the partner the direction of the gene and nothing on the other strand but if you cheat with hypoxia for 24 hours he'll get read from from the first man defense trained on Sun we see this massive induction and this is a Ewing sarcoma cell line so this is a collaboration flower in hypoxia coma and we haven't gone over the data yet she hasn't seen yet this is just just an example of the things we see okay so I had a summer student Haines in the Kospi that decided to look at all the data we have accumulated over its last three years from sequencing so we have enough 13 cell lines where we down both Bruce eke and brooch a seats we have synthesis and stability in these 13 cell line and she was going to look at she took as an example looked at 29 DNA repair genes across these cell lines what we've noticed when we look across cell lines for different genes we can see that one cell type may is synthesized a lot of a specific gene but the the transcript is unstable another cell line for the same gene may not synthesize much but the stability is very different so each cell line has ways to to change the set point for synthesis and stability there's probably a lot of interest in regulation but as a test case she decided to look at these 29 DNA repair genes and and just to a little bit of biology was what this DNA repair pathway doing this is for nucleotide excision repair this is the crucial repair system and you go out in the Sun and get lesion from UV damage so the pyrimidine dimers the helix distortion and they block transcription and replication and this system has developed over time to deal with these lesions the first step you have recognition of the lesion this contact looks at lesions all over the genome this is global genomic these factors have the help of the RNA polymerase getting stuck and recruiting these factors so that the lesion can be removed in front of the polymerase and supposedly you can resume transcription then you have factors and preparing this lesion for position and then finally you have the synthesis and ligation so just to illustrate this this fact that cell lines behave very differently for different genes so here are two these are pancreatic cancer lines this is X be a gene it synthesizes to the same degree but you can appreciate when we do the blue chain think that it's the ability of these transcripts are very very different very very different regulation post transcriptional regulation for this particular transcript and the similar code for this other I could see very different abilities so we decided to try to look across these cell lines and form this heat map and so here all the 2019 and here are the 13th cell line and it's color-coded so the more yellow that means more synthesized and black it's very limited you get this complex picture and you can maybe pick up Hill or this genius very poorly synthesized you can do the same for stability and and you get this kind of pattern and so I actually hear the RPA that was very cool it synthesized actually that sounds good very stable so then we thought okay is there a way to for us to kind of grab all the data across these different lines here so we can get a team score and and when we do this we look at expression of these 29 different units across the 13 cell line to look at which gene is the mostly synthesized among them and here we see the our PA as I showed before very poorly synthesized and you rank them and the same for stability you can rank them in here you can see that the RPI Sewickley poorly synthesized but it's very stable so that's how it maintains homeostasis of aggression you can do the same for cell lines and the ultimate goal of this is this is just a test case but when we have a number of cancer lines and we get this sort of stealth school we are hoping to determine particular cell line may be very vulnerable to particular treatment because the cell score in a particular pathway is very low and so those those could generate hypotheses that we can test both in cell but that's sort of the ultimate goal of this we noticed one thing so one little biology part here that we put together in the paper we've submitted it's this your cc6 gene it's a fairly unstable one of the most unstable transcript but it's also very large gene and this gene code for the protein this is very important for survival of cell with a streptococcus appears so if you have a and [Music] gene producing a very unstable transcript and this gene is actually very large so you could be hit by the scripture inhibiting lesion and if my act as is dissimilar that sort of Thunder though though those stress or low UV doses the gene which is very large is mostly on damage it can produce that the RNA make the protein and you can survive but it if the dose is higher is that the gene is fairly large it's actually three times the size of the average size of genes in the genome it becomes sort of a target for inactivation and any RNA that was previously done or made it's very unstable it'll go away the protein will not be made there so this is hypotheses we put forth but it didn't idea really regulate cell death all right the second story is looking at the rate of elongation or coronate preliminaries to down genes and to do this we employed a chemical that's called BLB so normally the RNA polymerase when it initiate it lands on the promoter like wait orphan it rested improve emotive proximal place and then it waits for kinase phosphorylates it's in front of the name and that allows you to get into elongation mode there's a drug called dl de that inhibits this class of kinase so now you can efficiently block the polymerase at the promoter so just to illustrate this in order to look at transcription in measure elongation rate it's really impossible under normal conditions because each gene will just hire a synchronous but with the help of DRB we can block the polymerase is at the promoter and now when we wash out the RV you can allow these two synchronously go down you can measure by labeling the RNA just after we release and we can measure how far they travel so this is the data so this is just orient you to what we're looking at this is the aggregated view or many hundreds of genes that are at least 50 KB long and this is the brucey signal we get just a scripture from this potentially start side into the gene now if we turn on the red light the DRB you effectively block the entry now if you wash out here B and then we needed to label the Omura D you can see this wave of transcription entering into the body of the game and if we allow another 10 minutes to go by we can see how this blade to the gene and by measuring the width of this elongation wave for this have three states a is upstream of the transcription start site very few reads then you enter this high read region and at some point you you're back to low level of leanness again by measuring the width of that we can determine how far each the gene transcribe during the labeling period which is 10 minutes so looking genome-wide or at least on the the gene several 40 kV or longer you can you can get elongation rate for each of those teams and here they're ordered from the past you can see there's a big variation in the great elongation genes they then looked across five cell lines to see if cell lines behave differently and there are small differences but we did not observe a dramatic difference between the different cell types in terms of elongation right violent plot the median elongation rate here you can see it it's somewhere about around 1.5 1.75 kb per minute then looking at genes that are expressed across all five cell lines we ordered them and we're asking if they're fast in this cell line or the shaft in the other and there is a trend that past genes in one cell line of path across the depleted tights and also the slow genes tend to be slow across so we were wondering what makes a gene slow and what makes a gene fast is it something with RNA polymerase difference that makes it go fast or slow or is it features of the gene itself that makes it go test so we looked at a number of different DNA features and and one teacher that came up was an epigenetic mark with HD kate 792 so when we ordered the gene in fourth group from the fastest 25% lower than 25% and then we asked if we map the different histone marks in do they differ and when we did this for this to take the histone mark they they ordered in the order of elongation so the fastest elongating rate genes had the highest level of the slowest lead so there was a correlation between this mark and elongation this particular mark is put on by histone methylases one L that has its Miss regulated in certain type of tumor so we're very interested in in faces role in genesis and whether elongation rate play some role in cancer so we're currently inhibiting dot one l could see whether that the prediction will be then that if we inhibit or trial that we could slow down the negation so these studies showed us that those factors that stimulated elongation rate and this was one of them and there was some correlation also with two other histone mark the h4 k 21 slight increased level in past the faster elongating transfer deans you also find that if genes were far away from other genes the elongated path so there's probably some less competition for ribonucleotides other things that make a gene faster if it's sitting by itself also teachers sequence itself would increase your engagement rate so low complexity was correlated to fast elongation and finally if the gene was very long that tended to to make it a little faster and likewise you find things that slowdown elongation so the density of exons in the transcript slowed down so the more excellence is slower you elongated if you had long terminal repeats in the DNA that slowed down the RNA polymerase CPG methylation gene bodies was also correlated to slower elongation and the density of line elements and at this point don't know exactly why this correlates but it's been suggested by other group that exons when RNA polymerase approaches an exon it slows down in order to be able to identify the splice junctions it probably specific histone marks and potentially nucleus on facing that breaks the speed or no an April in mix and it hits the XO so that was not unexpected alright so this final story is with the technique we haven't published it yet this is a technique we called blue UVC and this allows us to find enhanced reads at the beginning of genes transcription start site and also and you find more RNA the enhance for the ER at least that's what we think so I'll be very interested in hearing what you think after seeing Sam so just to illustrate why we use UV light and someone you might have seen its animation before but this is a train map of southern parts of Sweden where I'm from and you're going to take a journey from Stockholm to Copenhagen and in our boat we have lots of tree and let's say you take the day when there was a terrible storm and the travel but this is a gene and we kind UV light on the cell you go ahead you will get random transcription blockage throughout the gene and so if you're in the train here in norrköping you can only travel down to here and then you have something blocking but if you're in Stockholm obviously they don't have any phone or common communication so they just start to want to call train the two o'clock train vehicle they keep going so this is a gene you can just keep initiating the gene and expectation would be that you're rich in the beginning or near the transcription start site so it's that true so here again is it's an aggregate view so we're looking at a genes at least 50 KB long and they're all in line at the transcription start right so this is just a nascent RNA from brucey you see breeds into the gene bodies if you not you've irradiate right before we label to be given 25 you which introduced a lot of these breaks you get a redistribution of the read less reads and the body of the gene and that will allow for more beginning of the view if you go to at higher dose this doesn't mean that you have more initiation that you feed the Machine you know you give Bob 100 million molecules and he will sequence them and now the hundred molecule under million molecule that you have your you label or mostly come from here it's not that there are initiating so anyway this this made us think that we can maybe have this as a technique to really point us to where transcription starts just first you know when you shine something when you give sell something that randomly blocks transcription the larger the gene is the more in addition you will see and this is nothing new and it is totally expected the gene size when you look at the signal you get following UV it would decrease as a functional I and if you do this experiment just to look at the technical variability if you to take two samples and grow them in parallel parallel and stream is similar so so technically that the labeling the isolation of the RNA the library prep in the sequencing it's technically very so let's look at a particular gene we looked at this before the sanad 14 this is the nascent RNA the able we see throughout the gene if we go to encode methylation mark that has one promoter mark so it should be fairly simple how this where this gene is transcribed being from and let me do the blue UVC key you see yes it's one place that it starts from it goes into so that was you know it didn't help us much we kind of knew this but if you have a gene that's a little bit more complicated like this gene it has multiple potential orders and from the brew seek data it's a little hard to tell obviously it started here that's one from order but what other promoters used it's not very clear but then when you do the blue UVC it becomes very clear use that promoter that so it helps for genes that have multiple potential promoters to actually find out which one is used micro RNA is very interesting so with it with the nascent RNA technique the blue sea we capture the whole primary transcript steady state RNA all you get is this process very quickly but we can map really all the primary transcript this is one viewed transcript it would take it like 45 minutes to come up here that's gonna be the final product and just to verify that it starts over there you clearly see it has now this was a surprise for us it was when we started finding Peaks outside of genes so we expected to find enhanced reads at the beginning of jeans but we started to find enhanced reads between genes and we didn't quite know what to make out of that until we started looking at the encode data what those sequences may be the hints of course gene it's highly transcribed and I'm showing some upstream region here that has a potential enhancer element we don't see it even when we use the nascent RNA the newly made RNA we don't see any ER na and there's a promoter potential enhancing it identify the other group but the blue you see you see this enormous enrichment to read right over the no these are human fibroblasts in a unit are blessed and most transcribed highly the most highly trained that don't respond and normally I'm just cutting off an upstream of this gene he'd see really no signal when we used the nascent RNA brucy when they do the blue UVC you see the enormous region of what Vic Jung would call super enhancer or over the large region 280 region at the time the super enhance when we got this data super-handsome wasn't word yet so we we called it enhancer forests I don't want to put in a new nomenclature but this is our term for what we see so this are under steady state levels but ok so here's one more where we look at an aggregate view we take in sequences that encode are calling enhancer regions and then we line them up on the middle of those regions through the direction then we have give us all the signal we had for Brucie or believe is equal to low-dose with haidle see what what to the signal look like and you can see with just nascent RNA you see a little bit of reads over this enhancer it's not very impressive but if you shine UV light prior to labeling you see an enhancement if you go up to higher dose even a higher enhancement see this divergent character so it suggests to us that what we're looking at is potentially enhancer elements and capturing this ER RNA you can also look at these enhancers after reduce something to the cells so here we did experiments with normal fibroblast just reducing the acute inflammatory response to TNF and one gene that responds it Capodimonte but here's control and then an hour after we added E&F that can very highly transcribed if you do the brew UV seek we see upstream of this gene we see the production of something we think again the the nascent RNA sequencing at least transcript of shortly turnover very rapidly but we think that with UV light we can trap polymerase with the associated a RNA and that allows you to enhance just a few other examples so here's a p52 inducible would make young would call it super enhancer so this is treatment or five or less with something called not lend which stabilizes p53 and turns on a p53 response and one gene that it's the fact that and you can see this is control level six our transcribed very highly if you if you go up stream of this gene there is a large region that worker is on to not land so blue here are potential enhancer elements that are giving rights to er na but after nothing treatment it is highly enriched and correspond to to the gene that is downstream and finally I'll show you some experiment we've done with the drug one so Mick induces transmits a transcription fact that I've worked closely together that factor is called the early for that helped me run on both genes and also activate enhancer element this jq1 drug inhibit the early for and should inhibit mix ability to induce enhancer target gene so here's one gene that that look good after jq1 treatment found regulated and if you look upstream of this gene there is a region that is highly suppressed by jq1 and all of those Peaks correspond to make binding site which is found from the encode data indeed all these places will see a big signal here on my blue UVC click binding site potentially enhance the element that or nick given the TV take you one we collapse so we think that with this blue UVC technique we can genome-wide capture active enhancer and we're very interested to collaborate with people that focus on enhancer so in closing I've told you about these four techniques that we have developed the blue sea that helps us look at rate of transcription genome-wide luce see where we can all know what happens to RNA over time so you can look at slicing genetic of all 200,000 potential income and it's a huge signature and we haven't yet gone to multiple satellites we looked at two cell line and the splicing kinetic there it's quite a bit that's an interesting signature that you know unexplored and then also look at what happened in a old time turnover and as I showed you when you look at those different cell types there's a very different setting between the rate of transcription to reach homeostasis cells can play with these two variables in different way the Drude ERV see looked at elongation rate of transcription and finally the blue you see hands to read from the beginning of gene and capture yard and just to thank the people in the lab picture the summer from their sea so michelle has been with me from the start of development of these techniques and 15 years ago if you instrumental in getting these techniques going the three bioinformatics people that helped me daily or two who just graduated and Brian and so they helped me to analyze all the data or to was instrumental in also setting up the analysis pipeline or Haley was the graduate student at summer that looked at since synthesis and transcription synthesis instability or any applause Bell I showed you in the beginning and you lean at the graduate student there were they're taking one day that was from her Oscar goes to summer student mission in the lab Prasad had worked on the lighting project and we're open to collaborations we we get calls all the time and we collaborate with lots of people I like to ignore the Tom Wilson pathology who was very helpful in setting up the pipeline for analysis initially and these are people we collaborate with currently and this is this is growing it's still not a problem but you still add you on there if you want with that I thank you now we're going to thank Bob too for doing an excellent job and see that you show some introns to be retained very long and other entrance to spliced out as what we would like is when when you look at the est database at the Ernest sequences in the database there are lots of cases of retained introns in it I wonder have you done an analysis of these retained introns in the databases that at least to my knowledge were always being credited or Mis attributed to genomic contamination whether there's a correlation of these so-called retained of these things with your retained introns and so maybe they are not genomic contamination but just introns that take a long time to splice out yes we have looked at so the cell line I looked at was k562 cells and it also looking HeLa cells and we looked at other people's published data I think Tom's engineers has papers were they fractionated in different fractions chromatin Passyunk cytoplasmic poly a poly a plus a poly - and so forth and there are evidence as you said for entry retain most of that seems to be in the nucleus is not very much evidence in this side of class we haven't yet done at fractionation but that's on the list to do list to see whether we can some of the retained one or they're all in the nucleus and they don't get out but there's there's a lot of evidence for retaining interesting with the k562 to leukemic cell line i gave a talk somewhere and there was a clinician that stood up and said we do Lord of sample in a clinical sample every time to do leukemia we see lots of attention or the intro so they are seems to be notorious for being slow slices or slow turn over the in tropicals in the RNA seek data there's a lot of intronic signal thanks do you see any now you've described with the brew UV CT you're picking up transcription start sites and enhancers use any classes of RNA signals in there that don't fall in either of those two categories anything else well so we looked at things that or believe to be enhancers yes we see and written there obviously we see things we don't know what they are and it's that because nobody else has called it an answer so yes it does you know there's lots of places but majority I think people or the of the enhanced or in the beginning of genes and at something that we would suggest would be but there are places where we don't know the answer yeah okay have you compared these enhancer pics among different cell lines to see how constant were there were they or if you have like cell specific yes so I mean if you compare cell lines the genes being on and off or different so if you look at a particular one that has the corresponding gene is highly expressed you see a high P so if you go to other cell line where that gene is more or less off so it's very wherever we look the correlation of you know and we're guessing we haven't done hooked up exactly who talks to whom but if you look at genes nearby that seems to be influenced by it it's a very good correlation if it's highly enhancer it's high thanks that was really nice talk so I'll just add that there's a chia pet datum k562 so you can make those looping on Paul too so you can make those looping interactions and figure out who's communicating with you I was curious I don't know if you saw the Phantom 5 paper from Pierre Kearney GNA they did this cage tag analysis and they make a big deal they identify a rnase too but to me when I read that they looked very different than enhancers that are annotated based on chromatin marks for example k27 acetylation and I thought that your stuff looked much more consistent with k-27 subtle than for example the cage tags did I just wonder if you had any kind of comment what you think also in DNA's yeah we didn't know what to make out of the cage that came out we working on this paper and that came and they very efficiently captured signals from those regions but they only catch the very beginning of it they don't know how far it goes ours is not perfectly I may be you're probably going to inhibit the polymerase from moving and so we get probably the whole basket but we get a figure that it at least maybe PG kt-- out there the cage is on steady state RNA - so you know that was puzzling because you're on a turns over so quickly how do they get educated what we're planning to do is to do a brute cage the newly made RNA in a new cage of that and that should just tells you transcription its otherwise if you grew in steady state it's the height of it's gonna be returning on the turnover cage is very powerful very strong feet but we haven't done the analysis you did analysis and I have a small comment about my six to get my six to it has many copies of the chromosome so how you even even think about I don't know yeah well if we do the 30-minute labeling basically going I mean during labeling periods we don't see it so the trick is to block the polymerase doing the labeling and that sort of builds up the signal if it's so unstable that he so it may you know it's 2 KB long so it's it's done in like 30 seconds minute and then half fight might be minute so doing the labeling it's only the very last minute or two that's going to go into it that you can capture you see a little blip alright [Applause] Oh
