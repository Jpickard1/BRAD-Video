you know we want to learn more about what you're doing and figure out how we can work with you to up all of us urine more generally in the data science initiative thank you thanks Marcy and Jean for keeping the library connection a lot well Martha thank you for that introduction Bryan merci thank you for inviting me and thank you all for coming here and listening so I just to sort of start by saying so I've been I've actually been working at the library for over 10 years now I started as a as an undergrad reshelving journals have worked my way up so and I bent the my title changed I was a pedal with spatially numeric data library last november's I've been in this role for four five months so I kind of wanted to sort of talk a little bit about sort of the library support for visualization tell you a little bit about about my background some of the the current things that I've been starting on these past five months and then some sort of some thoughts I have about sort of going forward and then and I'd like to save some time at the end sort of hear a lot about what you all are interested in and how we can support you in the library I think there's there's a lot of support from people higher up the chain that mean for me sort of going and moving into new field really you all are interested you need you know and if you want to think about that well maybe warn you have talked undergrad so really good at sort of standing here until someone says if you want to think about certain things that you know that we can do to really support your research so just I just wanted to I know you you've heard from some of these people but I just wanted to sort of place my role in relations a larger ecology of supporting visualization so I think Ted Hall maybe Ohio and spoke about the the 3d lab so there's the digital media Commons which is a number of years today's it's more than one we could punch that out has been part of the library and say all sorts of exciting 3d things with the cave virtual reality goggles that they running 3d printing and there's also we've been talking this sort of started where I moved into this role but I've been engaged in these conversations there are in the process of working with came to what they're calling them is hubs and they're essentially going to be high resolution monitors lots of RAM and processing power and software they that you can sort of go and access I think it's like all times day and you sort of have a machine that's dedicated to doing the sort of visualization work and then the hope is that that if that sort of works on North Campus that will at some point put one here on central campus in the library so that will be a resource of course they're the how many information is our CG put here and are seen as well I noticed a other sorts of visualization things and definitely both of them know bioinformatics a lot better than and I do so they're a great resource and then and then I moved into this role back in November and became sort of a visualization library okay sort of mid all these things together and support visualization and really figure out how the library sort of the essential location for this I think one of the the main benefits of having it in the library is that we are sort of undisciplined in a certain you know obviously we have our specialists but but I think that a lot of times what happens with some of these things is that that both the infrastructure as well as the techniques it's kind of reinvented in all disciplines so my hope is that the library can be a place that that we can sort of bring people together from from multiple disciplines and I work in Mersin see that we can sort of make this be a campus conversation about visualization and using techniques and then it's not in the library but I also wanted to mention it because we've been working sort of morning more closely with LSA AIT now has the advocacy of research support is there some I think I mean this is important for the data science initiative I think for a lot of reasons so if you could say like two lines of yeah that'd be good so I my understanding is that essentially this advocacy and research support was actually modeled on the idea of librarian subject specialists so that there are Allison AIT individuals who are assigning to departments and essentially do sort of IT advocacy for faculty in those departments right I think maybe they started with a small set of departments and their plan is is just sort of grow it but for instance guys are embedded in the department or go back or they go back and forth so they're I think their offices are all in LS na and then so for instance I was I've been in a conversation with Seth Meyers who does statistics and might do physics and a couple other departments but one thing that he's done is he's put sort of one of these visualizations workstations in the stats department and it's sort of tucked away in a little office high-performance machine and he has it set up with CUDA so that people can do GPU processing and stuff like that for real-time visualization so I think that this will as we move forward integrating Ellison AIT and good because it's another way we can look at this is very helpful for me if you guys have a ecosystem building you know one way to look at it is you got you know from more on administrative point of views you've got Kane in the biz you got Kane in there's gonna be Vince upside there you've got the table and folks from Health Sciences libraries you know and so the health of biomedical science peace medicine and so on public Cal then he actually got some LSA routes so from from a guy who has to go and explain it from a campus perspective it's very convenient you know and then there is some something that holds you guys the glue in the middle research computing consider me the are crap okay I just have a question about that yeah so those are the beefy computers the monitors the things in some software but I think is there gonna be some part of that that's available for development of new things if I have software I want to try or writing software is that gonna be possible I I don't know for sure but I I would very much like that I think you know especially a lot of that I think like really like sort of interesting biz stuff is actually stuff that people are you know coding being able to compile and execute oh good we'll make a note of that well I can report that back as well as super an advocate for that but I think I think definitely because I feel like you know a lot of the for me I try to kind of constantly be doing visualisation projects to like know you know sort of what the landscape looks like and stuff like that see interesting things involved actually programming something of course there's there's lots you can do with sort of pre-built yep it's good yeah we want to move beyond and we have a brand for ourselves too all right so this is sort of a way that I've kind of been thinking about visualization and sort of the spectrum of visualization and my hope is that should the library as well as these sort of other campus partners and individual departments can can make sure that we're sort of covering this this entire spectrum and so over here on the Left I have something that I am especially interested in it sort of something that I think sometimes when people are talking about visualization they like half the people mean this thing and the other half that people mean this thing and you don't realize until after the meeting that you were talking about two different things so I just like to be clear that that I think these are all parts of visualizations so I think on the one side we have these sort of design questions how do you either take your data even if you're putting it into a black and white draft or a print Journal how do you make sure that that communicates the information you want and I think especially in in work with undergrads I think this is this is this is incredibly important because in addition to the sort of research that we do you know then being able to just mean because the New York Times has really been investing it like data journalism and they now have all the engine graphs and maps I only hired up two years ago and helped them you know I mean they've made that up going back 20 years now yeah and they have sort of doing all this interesting stuff so I think you know on a campus level I think it's really important that our undergrads can can critically engage with that discourse nation you know both the producers of visualization in whatever sort of field they go into as well as critical consumers of that information well that might not be exactly relevant or directly relevant you know to the day to day work that you all do I think it's an important part of what we do on campus and and also I mean for the sort of communication then that comes out of all disciplines so two or disciplinary audiences but also as it sort of migrates out to the general public I think being able to express data visually is incredibly important on the other end is it's sort of these these more kind of technical questions of high performance computing 3d environments using GPU processors multicores and sort of real-time you know multi terabyte visualization and in the middle I think there's there's a lot of work that's not sort of the high performance computing but being able to do sort of you know high quality and a reasonable amount of time doing sort of data munging and data scraping and in moving data between different types of software and between different formats and stuff like that a new term called data Wrangler mmm yeah I think it's Mike over taking money jiggy buddies saying yeah yeah and especially I think as you know as the sort of number of formats and the types of treating data proliferate being able to go back and even a lot of my sort of your prior it's been kind of in the social sciences and there's all sorts of data that still on tapes and like the data dictionaries are just sort of these printed things that have been rescanned and you have to figure out how to you know convert the like little endian binary and to you know something that a modern piece of software can use or something like that and so so there's I think there's there's all sorts of work here in the middle of that that both is a requirement so static design as well as data and we're also in the in the process at the library I think we're hopefully going to announce it soon that we're hiring a research data manager he's sort of part of these larger conversations about how we manage research data and make it accessible and make it reusable and this will sort of all be part of a much larger data conversation how we system yeah so um it's interesting it's putting the data in the middle of data and information is in access to that in the middle and the one word on this chart that's missing kind of which is in here in this analytic I mean this is a form of visual is this kind of visually yeah and I think you know I think that that this sort of ecology is it's part of a larger set of conversations both you know on the one hand sort of these questions about data management how do we you know keep track of data make sure that we're using it in ways that are you know sort of that are reasonable based on the data and then I think there are also other questions of the relationship between predictive modeling analytics visualization and hypothesis testing because I think that that there are ways that especially I don't know exactly LG but definitely in the social sciences they're sort of all of these tensions between you know especially if you do these sort of predictive modeling like the way that Google treats things and how that interacts they're very different ways of interacting with data we expose data to this I think will be will be sort of larger questions that still I know they're sort of right now kind of a crisis in in social psychology because a lot of the statistical methods that they're using are actually people who have figured out that they're actually not working as well as as people thought there were more deterministic well there was there was recently this this paper some there's I think he's at the Wharton School who he went and plays different groups of people like three different songs in order to prove that people who listened to one of them were younger than people who listened to the other one but it was just through sort of you know kind of messing with the p-values and correcting for all different sorts of things so they got a result that clearly could have been that true I think some some interesting questions especially in the social sciences the relationship between data I think all these questions about analytics will be will have to be sort of in that context so I wanted to say a little bit about about my background just so you know sort of where I'm searching these things and like I said a lot of my work prior so I've been a librarian I did my masters here at the information school and I studied information analysis and retrieval so there's a lot of network analysis texts finding these sorts of things with strong J s components of geographic information systems so prior to becoming the visualization librarian I was a spatially numeric data librarian further for three years and a lot of my work had to do with sort of mapping data spatial statistics this was a I made where you can actually zoom in it's where everyone in the u.s. lives and works so it's like 1.4 where someone lives and then a different colored dot for where they work zoom in and see like downtown Chicago is quite weird actually in Chicago recently visiting with some colleagues downtown Chicago and then you know they live out in the burbs kind of north of you know Evans and but they both actually had apartments downtown they both worked at the University of Chicago and I was outside and their primary residence was in you know north of Evanston but the commute was so long that during the week they often went to their apartments in Chicago downtown so you want to check that out because I was you know I was like run this and that you know it's like whatever you know and then I'm gonna like have an apartment downtown my house it's like but you know think about that ya know I mean it that sort of thing gets lost in this yeah yeah it happens a lot so it does so it's no I didn't mean to distract you but it's just kind of an interesting little data plan no I mean I think it's actually very relevant because I think so often you know would be when we move data from one context to another these sort of little things end up getting lost because maybe you know I mean this is based on IRS data so it's it's based on where people's primary residences are and there's certain nuances I think being aware of so like I said I also did a fair bit of work with network analysis and I'm very interested in sort of network metrics and these kind of things network layouts this is a map of the Internet this deep project where they tried to not the not the World Wide Web but the actual server infrastructure behind in anything that the colors are different continents this might be from 2003 but I think there's for me I find a special interest in this sort of network analysis and Marcy and I have been for two years now we've actually been teaching a cytoscape workshop for social scientists so it's not it's really a lot of fun because Marcy knows that cytoscape a little better than I do and social scientists are interested in network analysis and then also like I was saying a little bit of text analysis this was just a project mapping I think science and science articles on Wikipedia and whether or not you could sort of determine how likely they were to be articles about science and I think it's just the network layout so I just wanted to say a little bit sort of about some of the technologies that I'm most familiar with and that I've been been using I use are a lot people here and I've been teaching a service or workshop for a while on visualization techniques using our it's a very sort of lightweight introduction to our sort of mostly for people who either don't use are interested in sort of how to visualize information cytoscape and it's also it does analysis oh yes sometimes that by its it's out of the University of yeah oh yeah it's located for spider I think yeah but it's I don't know it does some things that I find hard to do insight escape so I think it's a it's also a good example of a sort of weird ecology we have of tools for doing visualization that you know that sometimes there's like one thing you might want to do in one tool and then there's another tool that like if they were Venn diagrams they'd be like almost on top of each other but if you need to do that and so this is one thing I'm really trying to sort of do is stay on top of these tools and stuff so that you can help make recommendations because I think at least I've found a lot of these tools sometimes come out and they've like put in addition and subtraction but they haven't gotten around to adding like division and multiplication so like you're working on some super beta version but it has a lot of height so everyone's downloading it just keeping track of what these different pieces of software can do um I've also been doing a little bit of work with sort of web technologies for interactive visualizations this is d3 is actually done Mike Babcock the guy from the New York Times is sort of JavaScript plug-in for doing all sorts of interactive and real-time graphing charts and and networks and stuff like that and I think there's there's some really interesting works to be done here I'm sort of a lot of the web technologies in just because of using javascript and Network oftentimes can't really support very much data at all so you're either looking at very simplified views of data or very small data sets and I think there's there's some interesting work to be done and sort of pushing large amounts of data to I don't know it just has anyone here ever had done anything where you know you've had some data set or wanted to represent something and needed to push it to the web for sharing you know in a way that you've only done and what towards to well we've actually developed many tools we have NCI bi it sounds of the National Center for many years but allow us to you know ultimately became Web Services that are used throughout the planet including knowledge some of ours tools so you know that's I heard yesterday you have 4,000 users pay for these registers users account we actually develop them and they're used all over the planet in some of our work is following platforms to allow for analytics to be linked with various kinds of heterogeneous only that are used all over the planet - okay yeah so we can actually help five months seems to go by incredibly quickly like it was just yesterday so I'm very interested in adding to this list you know based on sort of these conversations and what you all need and support I also I've been and this is sort of its to your question about coding this is I've been doing a fair bit in processing and moving to cinder which is a sea library for doing data visualization and it's it's like being used I think for a lot of like interactive shows and stuff like there are a number of bands that like have program they're like visuals in cinder for their rock concerts or whatever but it's but it's nice because it's in it's in C and compiles directly so you can can get some nice sort of real-time performance out of it one that we were working with a lot and it was developed by a good friend in Cali you know I actually use you know the guy who really did a lot of the work is he Bodine off who's here now in the School of Nursing but you know the lab is called the laboratory of neuro imaging Loney and this is so now it moved from UCLA to USC we have an international center for three-dimensional visualization of an atomic elements largely the brain neuroscience and we have a pretty big Loney installation here on campus and a lot of work it's one of these pipe pipe line tool that it's widely used for looking at radiographic imagery or we have now extending it to microscopic imagery in 3d and then like analytics so it's one we can throw in your listen to work with Marcy you know indeed and get that available to you and I actually have a production on the server okay so that would be no I haven't you really should it's designed for big that's another one that's definitely I'm Jeff turned me on to that and it's it's cool so we're gonna throw that deep learning in anaconda we'll both the elements of the infrastructure that it will want to work on okay you're with you and data science I don't maybe I shouldn't admit this but what I'm going to so because of my sort of background with text analysis I still do a lot of my scripting in Perl and I've been meaning to to make the jump to to Python so this is a high-end next-gen so we that sounds that sounds great it's been a jump that I keep meeting to make and now this sounds like that reason they've got a module in there that does d3 leap from Python okay oh yeah it'll just it's just ink power tools yeah so we're not calling long right now you know we have this trance mark platform it's all around the world now 30 probably power tools so using our tools so when taught we've heard about that I mean you know it yeah it's kind of a community tax processing who's seen would be a power to you know and so I think we want to do is be able to work with you guys to develop the power to little bit I like that idea very much and what you said earlier about what you know do different types of visualizations being used in different fields in scientific disciplines and stuff so it seems to me that you're in a very good position to kind of maintain set of examples or library if you will you have different visualization tools and approaches because I'm sure we can learn from each other right isn't reinvent that within each so I guess you know is that part of your so you know charter to some examples of this too so for example you know we do things inside escape as you mentioned right and it does some network analysis type things but we know where I know that our colleagues in physics and you know and so on and so forth this is just an example this is what I happen to know but I'm sure there are the things that I don't know about yeah and I think that would be you know very much in line with main library goals I would really like to sort of have this tradition of collecting books and stuff like that but exactly to sort of collect tools and click libraries and maybe even you know there are specific sort of scripts and stuff that would be helpful across campus and you developing good idea especially for cross-disciplinary thanks thanks yeah and I mean and everything from from methodology to a library of libraries so okay so so going forward or oh no I wanted to say a little bit more about sort of some of the work that I that I have been doing so I've been sort of meeting with people and doing consultations there was this was not a consultation I did but there was a poli-sci student who was for her dissertation is doing some work on sort of the ways in which so the political theory actually goes through the poli-sci literature so she was interested in doing some bibliometrics and sort of seeing how concepts sort of spread through the political science literature this was just an example I found I think it was out citations from nature so you can see that that's sort of the different journals I think so these are citations at the end the reference session captured where they're going so and and and this is the sort of thing I think especially that you know you could obviously gather the data but sort of the way in which you visualize the data is so important for sort of telling the story and making it accessible to people so I've been and sort of doing these these kind of consultations with with people who have sort of questions about how best to represent their data either from a sort of a visual question what sort of craps and chart should I use to a software question or these kind of things so this was a another project this was was very much in the in the humanities but I've been working with a professor who has been doing all this research on IRA Aldridge nineteenth-century african-american actor who went all over Europe and and performed and she wanted to sort of and she was teaching a class she got a grant was the faculty her name is Anita Gonzalez she's involved in the music and dance and so she wanted to have this sort of interactive website where you could and I have some students who are working on it they're still working on it but you could click on these and see sort of what performance he did in that location and when it was and she is a class where they're sort of recreating some of these performances or even having video of but it's it was quite an involved sort of programming project to make this sort of interactive math and we Europe but I was able to hire three students for her I mean it was with her grant money but I found the students and I've been meeting with the students once a week sort of talking about the underlying web technologies and how to scope the project and stuff like that so it's definitely an example more on the sort of mapping humanities time but it's a model that I think that could be beneficial going forward especially very important you know if someone was interested in doing something in maybe a tech not like web stuff if one doesn't do a lot of web stuff or something like that Nancy questions because I was pushing this with the data science initiative you know humanities aspect how much of that is happening here I don't know the various departments like English or you know art in architecture yeah I think it depends on the discipline I mean some discipline there's no one so it's still I think it's still something that U of M is sort of trying to figure out where we fit into a larger sort of national landscape around digital humanities yeah and exactly what sort of support we're gonna offer and you know how it's going to interact with tenure and stuff like that but there's there's definitely people who are interested and I didn't like Anita she this was her first year here and she was and at the Institute for the Humanities they eventually they've had a talk series called digital pedagogy so there's been a lot about sort of teaching so and then in terms of going forward and this is where I kind of want to share a little bit more about what you all are working on I think there's all sorts of exciting things from these sort of infrastructures I put this up this is I don't know if anyone people use tech spinning for for essentially it's it's a technique for dealing with over plotting so if you have you know large them if you have a scatterplot and it would just look super dense what you do is you divide your graph space up into hexagonal bins and then you just count the number of points in each hexagon and it ends up being sort of a really nice strategy if you had just such a density of each X it's like yeah yeah so here I think these represent different strata no it's just a scatter plot and see like the darkest ones represent seven points and the lightest one only has one point in it but you could imagine that could be like seven million points down to 1 million points it's sort of a 2d rendering of you could think of a 2d rendering of a 3d visualization so if the points at each intersection were stacked you've now collapsed that into a 2d visualization by by color to references it's more free if you have a two dimensional scatter plot that has a huge over plotting problem so you have like you know a million points right on top of each other and there's no way to tell that here there are a million in here there are only five because you know you have only so much resolution so what you do is you just you divide your your two-dimensional scatter plot up into hexagons and then you just count the number of points in the computer I see so it's a way that you know you're saying dude either in 3d is like yeah but this way they use a different color and you know so that top one is seven million points you don't have to grab seven million points in them yeah and so it's good it's kind of some kind of log scale so it's also sort of like a heat map but more discreet instead of sort of continuous with yeah yeah yeah it's very much like a heat map and so the nice thing is that a you can can sort of see a lot of points in a way you couldn't necessarily if it was in a printed journal but also it's a lot easier computationally so you could have you know an interactive visualization of millions of points you know in a way that you couldn't if it was just just a raw scatter plot necessarily and the reason I put this up is because it's it's really just a simple concept it's it's not you know it's not like the way you've got it now it's generic hey you know because the dimensions of the hexagons yeah yeah but this was I think the earliest reference I was able to find was in the early 90s so I just I think it's interesting that like this graphing technique is is just about 20 years old so there there's still all these sorts of in addition to the infrastructure around visualization there's still sort of innovative ways that we can sort of figure out to actually even just represent information and I think having that be sort of part of the conversation something that's really interesting and there are all these components from how we represent the information to how we're actually going to go about representing it what sort of a representation communicates the things that but the sort of most important thing and the thing that I'm most interested in today is sort of hearing about you know what sort of problems you all are running into what the library can can do to support your work and you know what what can we do to sort of help you with your research and your teaching and sort of helping this in this kind of ecology coalesce into something that's that's beneficial for everyone okay super so guys why don't we somebody to take over that side everybody needs to visualize something it's a good offer here personnel when are people running into infrastructure problems like are there visualizations you want to do but you don't have the processing power did you or you don't have someone to you know write the MapReduce program to run it on a cluster we're not doing a lot of Hadoop and MapReduce yeah and so you know you might take a minute or so and describe how that could be used sure so so we have here through our advanced research computing they have the flux cluster which is a multi-core cluster and there are a couple different techniques but one of the sort of generic techniques for running to parallelizing things and running them is process called MapReduce where essentially you have a function that splits up your data map set out to different chords and then each core essentially runs a reduce function on it so it somehow processes its little silo and then reports the results back essentially to the the map function so you can imagine if you had like you know a trillion numbers to add you would split it three trillion numbers so we're just so you know we're probably the largest consumer you know we have one research shut up a few of the cords but right now I have three thousand board just from one lab so you know and y'all are doing bioinformatics and analyst is here so both of the faculty have fairly sizable accounts on blogs how their specialization you know you're kind of in the high end zone so that means that you know we have special needs for visualizing and kind of lots of data you know and then bioinformatics is about analyzing streams of information right you know you know now we when we started this whole thing you know you know we were you know waiting for the day when the genome sequences in Belize but now we have the thousand genomes and so we can do statistical analysis of variation of thousands so library has experience with your sticks getting the message across just because you can make it doesn't necessarily mean it's getting the message across necessarily just translating usability when computer interface I mean that's not you know we brought Barbara into our group years ago before Barbara there wasn't element Carl Berger who was in our group and he was into the Dean in the education school who work on usability analysis for me as a physical human we found out that you know the gross anatomist would use the 3d data or a different way than the dentist would use it and the nurses so on we did a study post here's years ago really usability analysis and different communities you know actually you know understand different things in the video available that's that's one of the things that we're and I think another thing that we're getting into more and more certainly with parents mark and yes yeah Barbara helped us but this in the early days is lots of times you know the standard means that the publishing data break down when you have you know big data visualization so you know posting YouTube training videos I you know other thing against turning out to be a real need for us right now I mean it's huge but 1.2 release you know this is true the other big huge challenge across its how do we document what we're doing right and then workflow that's probably the biggest thing that worry about for us right now is okay the big challenge for us right now the field biggest challenge of all is so-called reproducibility challenge so he probably heard that you know nature science and selling certain classes and studies like clinical research more downstream from us but it's vital America to you only publish your paper but nobody can really reproduce you know why because the data was developed in a certain day and the visualization tool it was developed it certain you know they folks might not have access to that data in code and you know workflow and so the reproducibility of the workflow you know the whole idea of oh yeah I'm really excited about us research data there's we can get some some leverage there I think you're absolutely right it's you know and part of it sharing data but we should also be sharing code and we should be you know sharing workflows and we're gonna have to so we're developing the standard means for reporting that so that somebody can flick our work right back to our data and very rapidly in the publication you know launch our platform and reproduce our study and then if they want to put you data into the kind of and is that being done mostly here is it this is you know dr. Collins or eh director was addressing this issue at the scientific management review board yesterday we were watching on TV you know this is it's not just biomedical research but I think to buy on with the pharma companies that really started feeding on the Uni age because the pharma companies are taking nature science and sell papers once one study there were several studies one was a J&J study one one Amgen study but the bottom line is they could only reproduce about 25 that's a very important statement so this is leading to things which you should know about that in the method session sections of papers in the near future you know there's gonna have to be a much more categoric and explicit you know statement of the statistical model in the assumptions then you know had been previously nature and Macmillan you know publishing create your publishing group is way out you know nature scientific data it might be a journal you want to apply look at this you know kind of doing this kind of stuff now it you know figuring out how to publish the data so from a library perspective you know it's I think an interesting area to think about you know you're not just keeping track of all the journals of the books anymore you would be keeping track of you know digital research objects that are really you know we're just intermediating to a certain degree the publisher and you guys are gonna you know develop a data dictionary resource you know catalog for the institution I mean this work no 100 years from now to be there but this is the early days and so you're the visualization guy so you know that's a very important note on the network so you know I think what would be good is that we gotta let you got this you got our you know this is a good place for our you know a very good place for our we teach it in our class there's you know Maureen's doing a lot of it you know it's it's a standard yeah element in the bioinformatics are in biotech doctor I mean you know it's so we we could we could actually work with you we're developing with Hopkins now an extended our library for our trans mark platform so we have in our library already we can share with ya you know we're developing a bigger our locker and so that would be one to you know develop a catalog against we could do that right away it would be helpful for us that even with our 1.2 you've got the cytoscape people here you know and we used to be a member of the site escape pack are you using some of those in need of course no I think but okay so let me just jump in on that point because one of the things that we're doing right now and this is going to be a huge initiative I'm sure the president is that you know the days of thinking of madison's kind of narrowly in health a little bit more widely but you know linking the medical and health data with the environmental data and the social data you know is the you know which would be economic data for example demographic data you know this kind of thing so you know you know in our world we'd like to think about you know a lot of the molecules that are making the mechanisms or you know life then we decide one day maybe we uh you know characterize what we call the phenotype maybe even look at electronic health record she didn't typed anytime but then we said gee you you know in health and disease well all of a sudden you open the Pandora's Box to hell so then all of a sudden what are the determinants of health is it all your genes I don't think so it's like what you eat it's the environment are you smoking all these things of things you know and then and then you know well maybe you're living next to you know the mercury you know you know the incinerator down Detroit you know maybe you know it's like they say what happens to Beijing you know there's four days from Los Angeles so you know we're in this connected world so if you think about the fact that we're we're gonna go and this is Richard Gonzales now it is our it's this biosocial research concept where it's the health for medical and health data so the health system will supply synthetic derivative of the health record or the CMS records and then and then you have the environmental data or the school of public college to be able help us you know and out into ISR and so if you think of you know so so all of a sudden what we're saying is so this spring or map could become important for example because you know we we will we will push the development of these integrative data resources up from the bottom of our this will be services coming out of art and then research collaborations will start against the boundaries of medical and how social science and health of something like that I mean that's the vision yeah you know and we're gonna pretend you know this vision will be presented and you know in a matter of weeks and the Flaming building that's part of its not the only vision but it's a it's a good one and I think that that's something we're comfortable with here because we would like to have the opportunity to expand out of our very narrow box yeah yeah and I should mention if anyone is ever interested in doing any sort of mapping stuff I still do a fair bit of joyous and well that's important because Jim half against it like our physical human for example I mean you know Matt could be you know yeah you could plug anything so yeah the brain so Obama one of the things we're gonna put in say it's inevitable we are gonna have to get a neural science initiative John I've been in a lot of meetings with you know you know we talked to sisal about it who their kills running and she's been down there it's a cloning building several times you know Michael John's the unit secretary are all hearing it the Dean being continuously you know Obama's got a brain initiative how can the University of Michigan not have a brain I mean you know and then we have engineering and biomedical engineering and you know all this stuff going on the brain you got the psychiatrist over here so the three-dimensional you know topology the brains that's why we bring a moaning to the table or Alzheimer's disease so I think that's an area that you should be aware of that's gonna grow okay so let me just what we're thinking so we can measure to some of the genes and Alzheimer's disease we can measure some of the brain structures we can measure the cognitive impairments that kind of thing but at is our we have a longitudinal study funded by the NIH seventy million bucks you know how people aged over time you know at various kinds of impairments impairments so if you can bring those all together and we got a guy coming in who's gonna help us with this EP you started with you boys working on this I mean how can you bring these data together yeah yeah it's gotta happen why because Alzheimer's in the United States gonna be a trillion dollars a year yeah economy by 2050 okay so that's why we're good and so I I just want to make you aware that you know if you think baby I'm thinking digital humanities days think about you know some of the stuff you can do with these dads and engineers you know in the information science so I think the network analysis all of the same still be huge and I think next year we're gonna hire in that right is there any other well good Thank You Justin and there are see in the gene for the vision of bringing Justin and teaching us about this emerging new post rupture and RC why don't you arrange a little private meeting assuming we can transfer with gene and we can transfer some of these early technologies like Bologna and others we'll make some links you know and you know the other thing is we want to take you up on this teaching on you know the our module thing might be a way to go with that and we can get a list of our modules that we have in a new list coming from Hopkins we can get you in our library okay [Music] [Applause] [Music]
