(upbeat music) - Good afternoon and welcome to this the celebration of
the 10th anniversary of the Department of Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics. And congratulations on
this milestone achievement to the leadership of the
department, the faculty, the staff, current students, and alums. And welcome to all who are attending in person, or virtually. Later in the program, Dr. Athey
is going to be talking about his vision for the
future of the department, but I think it is worthwhile to look back and think about the
creation of the department. Because a very valid question is why does the University of
Michigan Medical School have a Department of Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics? It's not a traditional
basic science department, it isn't a clinical department. So, what were the events
that led to its creation, over a decade ago? The Human Genome Project was released, there were dramatic advances
in high performance computing, new methods were developed to
analyze very large databases, and faculty here at the
University of Michigan became increasingly
interested in this new field that was called bioinformatics. Students were also interested. A graduate program was
initiated, and in 1999, the multi-disciplinary Bioinformatics Graduate
Program was launched. Very importantly, with
support from the EVPMA and from Pfizer and the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute. In 2005, the rapid growth and success of the graduate program was
followed by the creation of a university-wide consortium of faculty who participated in the
Bioinformatics Graduate Program. This consortium co-founded by
Gil Omenn, and Brian Athey, was the Center for Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics or CCMB. Also, in 2005, the NIH founded the National Center for
Integrative Bioinformatics, sending a strong signal
that bioinformatics was a particularly important new branch of medicine and science. This nascent scientific
field kept growing, and in 2011 the Institute of
Medicine published a monograph that codified a lot of the
work that was being done right here in Michigan. It recognized that biology
was a data intensive science. There was a great opportunity to integrate data intensive biology with medicine. Dramatic advances in
information technology were driving systemic changes. And very importantly,
there was a need to bring the multiple stakeholders
involved together. The result of all these events,
and a series of discussions, among Gil Omenn, Mike Savageau, who at the time was the chair of the Department of
Microbiology and Immunology, Brian Athey, myself, and others, led to the initiation of the process to create a new medical school department. But a new department isn't just created. Our medical school bylaws
lay out a series of steps that must be followed successfully to initiate a new department's creation. This culminated in a vote by
the executive faculty approving the creation of such a department on August 5th, 2011. And on September 15th, 2011, the Board of Regents unanimously approved the establishment of a
new academic department named Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics to begin January, 2012. As I look at what has been accomplished in the ensuing 10 years,
you have not only lived up to what was envisioned at the
creation of the department, but vastly exceeded it. Congratulations to all
who have worked so hard to make DCMB a thriving
department in our medical school. Looking forward, I fully
expect that the department will continue to be a major contributor to the intellectual climate, research, and educational excellence of
not only the medical school but the university at large, and also to the nation and beyond. I trust that you will enjoy
the remainder of the program and thank you for the opportunity to reflect on the department's beginnings. (upbeat music)
