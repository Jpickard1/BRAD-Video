few people missed I'll just trickle down and we'll just go ahead and get started so it's a real pleasure to introduce Adam flowering and who's I was speaker today and Adam received his PhD in molecular biology in 2000 at the University of Washington and he also received his degree during his graduate studies he Krysten Ritter pathogenesis using various model then he continued his fourth great work at UC San Francisco and there he focused on the evolution in dynamics of poliovirus and also completed his medical training in 2012 he came to yoga and joined the faculty at the Medical School and today he's going to talk to us about tools to studying RNA virus diversity thank you thanks here be okay probably good well thanks this is fun um that's some of you along the way I hope to meet more you I consider myself kind of bioinformatics light I'm your end user but because of some of the questions that we've been asking we've had to make some auras into your turf a bit and so I'll play a little bit about that today Oh get an input so my lab my research interest is in RNA viruses particularly their evolution RNA viruses as a group are remarkably successful pathogens they cause a wide range of illnesses from respiratory viruses the common cold flu infectious diarrhea steffel itis hemorrhagic fevers which were always in the knew as well as hepatitis and then many childhood rash illnesses one of the reasons they're such successful pathogens or at least yeah one of the reasons is that they're very adept at evolving and this allows them to do a number of things in the case of flu you know be a zoonotic and other zoonotic agent which can migrate between multiple species there are a number of RNA viruses that are arboviruses or insect vector viruses that can replicate in species of mosquitoes and humans primates separated by millions of years of evolution they're quite good at escaping immune surveillance one of the reasons of course why we have to get a flu shot every year you should get yours in the next few weeks and so escaping antibody or CTL responses and then finally drug resistance often the first indication of a drug target or virus is isolating the resistance mutation it can evolve quite readily and generally accepted that RNA viruses of all so rapidly to a large degree but not exclusively because they have very high mutation rates and this is a diagram which I think illustrates it nicely which shows the mutation rate versus genome size and so most of us or all of us are down here and then RNA viruses have mutation rates that are several orders of magnitude higher than you know DNA viruses or DNA based life-form and that's because there with one exception the RNA dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome has no proofreading or repair activities and so therefore the virus is unable to correct its mistake the polymerase is unable correctly at stake and the mutation rates for RNA viruses range between 10 to the minus 4 the 10 to the minus 6 mutations per a nucleotide copy per cellular infection cycle most most RNA viruses are roughly 10 KB long their genomes and so that translates to approximately one mutation per genome replicated and so every newly generated genome in theory is distinct from the parrot genome and this means that the virus could quickly become a population of closely related genetic variants this this population it's called a cloud a swarm a quasi species genetically diverse population any term you want I like swarm although cloud is nice too and it's there's a large amount of interest in understanding what this diversity is therefore and what at ye you know if Sarah is having this sort of swarm different from this one swarm basically and is that affect how the virus behaves and if that explained differences between either different viral species or different variants within the same species and that's a question that we're very interested in and we approached this so far with two viruses poliovirus word in which I did most of my postdoctoral work poliovirus being a very nice model system of course it's still a virus that causes disease in people but a lot of its power now lies in the ability to do things in laboratory quite easily with poliovirus for a number of reasons it's also well studied virus so a lot of the molecular biology as well worked out and so and the genetics are quite easy but then more recently we've started to branch out into influenza virus and those projects are a little bit more translational we're looking at influenza viruses in people and I'll tell you one project in each today one about an informatics tools we've developed with the help of Ryan mills in your department for manipulating genetic diversity and the other is a tool that we are looking at and influenza for characterizing or defining diversity and those are the two things we're going to do and so first I'll tell you about manipulating diversity and really it's like well diversity is there but to really study what it's doing you'd like to have some way of controlling it you know having the ver storm a or diverse swarm B and then you know distinguishing what's different and that's a problem I started to look at in my postdoctoral work and continued here and one way I get at this is I told you that the virus has a high mutation rate and that's kind of the engine that generates genetic diversity right however there's a lot more to mutation rate in determining patterns of diversity in a population and this slide I think illustrates it well it's that you have HIV and influenza have essentially the same biochemical mutation rate they make errors of the same frequency however this is a tree show a sequences of HIV in the Congo in 1997 and then this is a tree showing influenza is still a pretty diverse virus worldwide in 1996 and so you can just say well you know one virus has a lot more diversity that it can express than another and so there's more to it and we've been interested in understanding mutational tolerance of a virus also known as mutational robustness and the idea is is this is the virus mutates and you get you know a dominant variant and all these other little variants around it that are related and which ones are there depend on how well that mutation is tolerated most mutations are bad in probably about 30 or 40 percent or lethal to the virus and so you can make that mutation but it's a dead end and it's never going to rise in frequency in the population because the virus can't replicate anymore many more mutations are detrimental so they they can increase in frequency because they're essentially a crippled virus and they can't replicate well and so a virus that has in general mutations that don't cause as much damage will be tolerant mutation or mutation a robust and the idea is how the more robust population can maintain a larger degree of genetic diversity and that might be another thing that controlled patterns of diversity in a population and so well gee that's that's a group that's a neat idea it's been around for a long time and there are a number of things that probably affect how well a virus tolerance mutation and one question I became interested in it there's there's codon usage by the virus effect mutational tolerance and I'll walk it through two different schematics the first one is here is and the idea is that you know how you use your codons determines how well you can buffer mutations in your genome and so here's an extreme of arginine which is encoded by six different codons and so in the protein it doesn't make it different it's arginine has the same charge it does the same thing to protein however different arginine codons mutate nonsynonymous Li at different rates through the connectivity of the genetic code and then within the nonsynonymous mutations you can get different if the if you start with an AGG you can get these different amino acids as their one mutant neighbors whereas if you have these you get very different neighbors and so the idea is maybe codon usage doesn't affect the protein but it but the one mutant neighbors will give rise to very different protein and at a high in a virus that it's a high mutation rate maybe this would have an effect on overall you know the virus is tolerant of mutation and that's the basic idea and so walking it through another example is you have this Elvis peptide that's encoded by two different stretches of nucleic acid okay different codons but they still code for Elvis however the one mutant neighbors of all of these are different so if you start with this nucleic acid when that Elvis peptide gets mutated it's going to be a different peptide than if this Elvis peptide that of course these will be located in different regions of sequence space whether Tennessee or Nevada and of course these would give rise to Elvis's of very different phenotypes and and so the idea was basically can you generate viruses that have large scale synonymous mutation across the genome so they start with the same amino acid sequence but they start in different positions in sequence space and are going to mutate differently and thereby create different population and poliovirus one of the nice things is it's the first virus that has been chemically synthesized using long long eligos and there were several viruses already generated called max and SD which have either 566 or 934 point mutations across the capsid region of the genome and so they code for the same capsid protein but they're going to mutate differently because their primary nucleic acid sequence different and so we're going to compare these two synthetic viruses with large-scale synonymous mutation to the wild type virus in our work we were able to show that indeed using thief sequencing that these viruses did give rise to a different mutational spectrum okay shown here are the codons across the capsid it's 881 codons and this is basically a heat map where each little bar is a mutation that was detected and the the scoring the heat is the blossom 62 score which is you know empiric measurement of how common a mutation is and it used in I don't need to tell you in alignment algorithms and then a top across the top is this trace which shows how variable that region of the capsid is looking at all sequences you know in GenBank and so this is you know the capsid is a tightly organized structure but there's also loops that are more variable than others and then there's more conserved protein protein interfaces that are less variable and I think you can just quick glance and see that wild type and then the to synthetic viruses Macs and SD had very different patterns of mutation and they gave rise to very proteins with very different amino acid substitutions and so by switching the nucleic acid we indeed give rise to populations that have different functional variants and then we went further to show that basically by doing this we made the virus more or less tolerant of mutation and so this is an assay where we treat viruses with ribavirin and culture and ribavirin is a mutagen and so it gets mis incorporated and templates gee-day and CDE mutations and so in a dose-dependent manner we can increase the viruses mutation rate and then if a virus is less tolerant of mutation it will lose titer and we found that SD was actually hypersensitive to mutation so it was less tolerant of these newly generated mutations and that may that would be consistent with our model which codon usage is a functions as a buffer communicational load and then surprisingly when we put these viruses into mice we found that mutational tolerance was actually important in that the most sensitive virus to mutation SD was also attenuated in mice and so that implied to us that viruses need to be able to buffer the mutational load in order to maintain a stable population and that is somehow important for how they behave in vivo so this work was published in 2012 right when I came here and took a while publish I'll tell you that and we got a lot of reviews and everyone raised very important caveats and one is of course low end we did this with three viruses that's cool but that's not a lot and then probably more relevant for this talk is that well yeah you did the somatic mutation but Sinai's mutation will affect a lot of things not just mutational tolerance and have you adequately controlled for these factors and we did but you know you can never be sure one you change the sequence these viruses have a lot of RNA structure in their genomes and so by changing the the codons around you might be disrupting important RNA structures you may be affecting codon pair bias which may or may not affect gene expression you might be affecting dinucleotide bias certain dinucleotides are thought to be sensed as like pants if you know pattern signals that the immune system recognizes for example CPG it's sensed by toll-like receptors and maybe you're altering that maybe you're affecting maybe you're introducing spurious micro RNA binding sites and so we're like okay well there's a lot of things to control for it sure would be nice to control for all these things and and isolate mutational tolerance is one factor unfortunately we thought well you should be able to do that right because synonymous sequence space is large if you have a 20 amino acid peptide that coded by one of each of the 20 amino acids back-of-the-envelope calculations you can have 10 to the 18 different primary nucleic acid sequences that will give rise to that same peptide so that's a lot of possibilities that you can try and you should be able to find something that controls for all these other things and so soon after I came here I sent an email I don't remember who has sent it to but somehow I wound up getting to Ryan Mills who has helped us enact this project and this is all the work of Daniel as a postdoc in my lab informatics and we developed this tool called codon shuffle that I'll tell you that that's implemented in Python and so it starts with the idea of well we wanted to generate sequences that we could synthesize and test and we do this using a variety of different permutations algorithms and basically swapping either single nucleotides or dinucleotide or diet or tri nucleotides essentially keeping the amino acid sequence the same and then just that you know by shuffling them around your sequence you generate a lot of different primary nucleic acids so it's basic you know permuting the sequence but keeping the coding sequence the same and then the second step is analyzing the sequences and you know I don't think we came up with any of these metrics on our own we basically used existing tools so for example you can measure the codon bias via the codon on adaptation index or the effective number of codons we used both unfold and Vienna RNA to measure the free energy of RNA folding across our sequence we measured dinucleotide we measure code on pair bias etc and what was shown here is we per muted a poliovirus sequence a thousand times so we generated thousand different commuted sequence for each of these for permutation dominant so about four thousand sequences and then we generate a histogram of how these sequences their values for a given whether it's CAI or the free energy of RNA folding and then we're like okay well what does that mean nice you can generate a histogram how is is the codon adaptive index of 0.675 really that different from one at point seven for poliovirus we didn't know and so what we plot along with this is the CAI for or these were the holding for other enterovirus ha's so we had a panel of 89 and or viruses sequences from GenBank and we did the same metric and enter viruses all had the same general structure as poliovirus they the same replication strategy so it's sort of a control set these all replicate in people and so these are ones where presumably over this range of free energy that's fine it's kind of a biological control for what we're doing and so we did this for four thousand sequences generated these distributions and then the goal was well we want to pick sequences that are as similar as possible the wild type right so they have the same CAI as wild type which is highlighted as dotted line as close as we can the same free energy folding the same time nucleotide bias etc and here's where the real challenge came it's so well how do you how do you do that particularly when you've got all these different metrics that have different scales and different law values like how do you say something Oh point seven or versus point seven to five versus - 800 versus - 600 and I shall come back to that so what we did is essentially we have these normal distributions we know where wild type is and essentially we said okay how far by z-score are these from the wild type and so it's something that's close to wild type you know the z-score should be low the delta z should be low something far a delta z score should be high so how many standard deviations is at all and the advantage of this is it kind of normalizes across scales on values into a single metric that you can use and what we did is then did a least squares regression to essentially say okay across code on pair bias folding for the energy effective number codon code on adaptive index and dinucleotide frequency which of these 4000 sequences has is the closest by delta z across all those delta z scores okay and we call this its least squares distance or D which we plot a least squares distance versus the Hamming distance in nucleotides across all our holux pieces in here for 1,000 sequences per muted with this D and 2/3 one algorithm we have all these dots each we represent a sequence and you can see and there's a number of them that have a least squares of 0 so on average they are pretty close to wild type and in all these other metrics and yet they still differ by 550 to 600 bases so quite distinction you know genetically at the nucleic acid level identical at the protein level but yet all these other factors are generally averaged out with being similar to wild-type so then we're like well how well this is perform and not talking about performance in the informatica literature in terms of how many CPUs and how quickly it runs I'm talking about well how good are we are exploring possibilities and so what we did is we ran it 10 times so we generated 10,000 sequences and we're saying are we hitting on the same solutions you know you know are there only so many solutions to this problem to get a sequence similar to wild-type and indeed there's a lot of solutions so this is just a haplotype accumulation curve literally measured the number of sequences versus the number of unique appetites every haplotype was unique so we ran it 10,000 times we got 10,000 unique sequences okay and then this is plotted just the same plot only each color is a different run of a thousand okay and so again least squares versus hamming distance here are the ones that are closest the wild type with the least squares of zero and they're all distinct sequences so you can hit on something that's very similar to wild type across this range of metrics but with very different sequences and then this is just a neighbor joining tree showing these think forget how many sequences there were here 80 like that that have this least squares of 0 they all differ from each other by about 500 bases so it's not like they're they're just you know single ancestor that they're all similar to they're all as different to each of the other ones which is consistent with what I told you about someone in a sequence base being really large and there's a lot of possible solutions to this problem and so this was really exciting does it mean well gee you can do this you can permute the sequence to your heart's content and still get out your desired product and a lot of candidates that you can try so we just published this again with a lot of heavy lifting and help from Ryan and we think there's a number of applications for this tool so one is you could use it to choose sequences that are similar to wild-type in every way and ask are they more or less mutation robust and that courses was what got us into this in the first place so that's one thing we're interested in how about you can also say well we could choose sequences that are different in every way okay you could say I want to pick a sequence that's over here that's different in its codon pair bias and it's dinucleotide bias and everything it's just completely different from wild-type you're like well why would you want to do that well there's been a number of papers where synonymous since that synthesized synonymous altered viruses have been used in vaccine design initially in polio and now in flu VSV dengue and the idea is you're pushing the virus in a way you're altering its genome and you're taking a sledgehammer to a genome and changing the way it replicates because you're altering all these things that are probably important for replication and gene expression but yet a little bit of the virus it makes it's going to have the same amino acid sequence right so it's going to be immunological II identical that's recognized by your immune system so you can attenuate the virus preserve its antigenicity and be a live attenuated virus and so basically you could we might be able to do this by altering all these things to make more complete attenuation and make it less likely that the virus will revert the variable and then you could just try to understand other factors you could maybe you just want to look at CPG bias you could generate a virus that has everything else the same but it's just different in CPG bias and understand how CPG bias affects the virus's behavior and so we think this is a tool and that'll make people in my field able to better answer some of these questions in basic virology and in a little bit of a venture we're now on github and so we we have it there and we just got our first pull request you know that someone's been making some improvements to our software but that's kind of fun because it means people are using it and so that's the code on shuffle work and so now I'm going to move into our flu work where instead of manipulating the viral diversity we want to understand natural viral diversity and in cell culture it's easy to generate viruses a lot of diversity but in people with a viral infection there's probably not the same amount of diversity and another question it's very interest interesting to us is what happens when a virus goes from one person to another in a sneeze or touching something and putting on your face or whatever happens how much of that diversity gets transmitted from one person to another and what can you understand about infection vaccination by understanding how versatile versity changes natural infections as they're transmitted so we've been working a lot to develop both the bench protocols and also an in traumatic pipeline for deep sequencing of viral populations directed against getting samples from individuals and so our sample that we're going to be using in the flu studies are essentially a throat swab of someone so take a swab of someone's throat put it in media and then we take that do an RNAi prep develop a sequencing library and characterize the diversity so very different from taking a cell culture dish with tons of virus in it and looking at diversity and so we've optimized multiplex rt-pcr to simultaneously amplify all eight genomic segments of the WHO genome fluid eight chromosomes and so we can do this quite well now we get very nice sequence and we sequenced a very high depth of coverage about 20,000 x with the idea that well covered the verse library would allow you to call rare single nucleotide variants in the population which is our ultimate goal and then where we've been spending a lot of time it's on the informatics and this is largely the work J Tina crow and a graduate student in the lab you get all pixelated at this size JP so I don't think I need to tell in this audience that there's a lot of sources of error in a next-generation sequence day and this is from a review from George Kirk that characterizes some of them and while their sample preparation in our case that's a biggie because we start with an RNA genome so we always have to do a reverse transcription before we do a PCR first transcription reverse transcriptase has a high error rate and so that's something that we can't get around it so that's an important source of error that it's probably more specific what we do then for example you know a human genome where you can sequence in 48 coverage and get everything you need to know and of course ours is now aren't a simple diploid setup library preparation it's another issue and then where there's been a lot of tension it's the sequencing and the imaging and calling a base and of course when you're calling a base 20,000 time you're just gonna have you know a low frequency error can be hard to stick to distinguish from a rare variant that's our basic problem and so I distill it that how to identify a mutation and as a virologist it's like well if you look at a gel and you see a band or no band that's simple right and if you're a little more modern and you've got a chromatogram and you've got a red and black here you there are ways you can just look at that and tell well that's probably something we're not going to be able to call but if the red were a little higher we'd have more confidence that maybe that's you know on that base but then the problem is of course you know when you get 20,000 little Peaks like that how do you do it and so I think the issue for us is specificity I think the field at least in my field everyone's focus more on sensitivity can you detect these rare variants right varying color fine things that are 1% or less there's a tremendous amount of focus on that but specificity I think it's a bigger problem and that's illustrated here I won't tell you what paper it came from but essentially here you have intro host single nucleotide variant frequencies across a range of samples you know there's a star here so there's a significant difference right but you can see well gee really ok these and these yeah they sort of look different but these are all pretty rare and if this is what you're measuring you really need to be sure that these things are all real and not you know noise you might just be finding slight differences in noise that achieve the physical significance and so what I what what is often reported in the viral literature is like well we achieve 99% specificity with our variant calling it which sounds great right 99% is awesome but if you have a 10 KB genome with three possible bases of each position there's essentially 30,000 possible variants that you're calling so if you have 99% specificity you have 150 false positive with 99% of it specifically which is really high I mean that's almost all your audio signal and so we think you need to get a lot higher than 99% and our goal was 99.9% on specificity which wouldn't get you to 0 falls positively get you closer so there are a cornucopia of variant callers out there here's just a few so we didn't develop a variant caller but we want to make them better the ones that other people will develop and I think a real issue is my little hobby horse here is in the informatica literature a lot of these variant callers are benchmark with simulated reads or things like that so we simulated a bunch of reads and then we look up we can find all the mutations and our specificity is 99% well that's very different for the end user right who's like ok I'm going to star with a bunch of RNA and then I'm gonna use your variant caller and I want to believe what comes out and because there's biological sources of error that the variant call is not going to you know the control for and then there are certain issues as I'm sure many of you realize that are specific to your experimental setup and so one variant caller might not meet all needs we settled on one which is called deep SNV which was initially developed to look at tumor heterogeneity so calling sniffs and tumors and what it essentially does is it uses a binomial model to detect false positives from a real variant and the idea is you use sequence of plasmid control in the same flow cell as your experimental sample so you take a plasmid you put it through the same library prep you sequencer the same flow cell and you see have a large number of read on that plasmid sample and that'll tell you kind of a background noise and a true mutation in your sample I'm showing here is red will have a different frequency profile and then you can distinguish them I'm using a binomial and why we chose this variant color out of all of them is it's one of the only ones that we saw benchmark with actual experimental data so you know I hope I'm not slamming simulated reads because there's a lot of value but they actually took you know PCR products and then mix them and then show they could detect and that made me feel kind of warm and fuzzy so that's why we picked it nothing else special I'm about that's very color um and then we designed an experiment because that's what we do and you'd be surprised that I don't think this I don't know if this has ever been done in the Verilog biology literature for all the deep sequencing that's being done and published I don't think I can think of a paper where someone's actually said okay we've benchmarked this and we know we can find a mutation at this frequency and what our false positives are and so what we did is we have 20 viruses each with a single nucleotide mutation okay and each of those viral stocks has been Illumina sequence okay so we know that it has the mutation and we know if there's any other kind of mutations that have arisen in that viral stock because member the virus is going to make its own errors we diluted these we also have a wild-type sequence that has been Illumina sequence twice okay so we know what the real variants are in our wild-type population we diluted a mixture of these twenty mutants into the wild-type at varying frequencies from 5% of each mutant down to 0.1% of the community and then we varied the input by titer so we either start with 10 to the fifth viruses all the way down to 100 viruses okay and so we've got 20 20 different samples we may duplicate libraries of each and put them all in one high seek and so we have multiple levels of control that detect true and false positives that's basically what I want to get involved and then we say okay what's our we use that we've been using ROC s to say okay how do we do sensitivity specificity and here's where we started by a viral Turner kind of the four down to ten frequency of the mutations basically color and basically all I want to get across here is we did pretty well right I'm using off-the-shelf default parameters on the variant caller we can get down to you know you know certainly nine greater than 99.5% specificity and we start losing sensitivity at lower variance and then also of course when you increase your specificity you're going to lose your sensitivity and that's the trade-off that we're looking at and so we're like okay well this is good but can we do better and we started playing around with a number of things and chasing down because we know what our false positives are because we know what went into the mixture and we know we're trying to find twenty mutation and there shouldn't be anything out okay and so well okay okay what what are we finding that's not those twenty mutations and what characteristics about them can we figure out one just to show an example here is well if if this is applauding the position of the mutation on a hundred base you know high seek you know read two by hundred and saying okay where is the mutation call on the read on average and remember we have high depth of sequence that we have a lot of reads that call a mutation and basically the false positive are shown here and they tend to be towards the end of the read even with a good quality score so these quality score is greater than thirty but they're on the end of the read and they're false positive whereas the true positives the average read position of that mutation is in the middle and so we can just apply that simple cutoff to get rid of a lot of false positives so that's just one example of how we zero in on which things are true and which things are false and how to filter them out and it's all empiric so then the way we do fullscreen JT set up this it's like a pea ice-cream is the SHINee app which many of you use I love it because JT can load up all the data and I can just play around with it and and see though it's little work on my part but a lot of information and so you can just play around with data and it's fun and we also better hope to publish it soon and put this on github let people play around with the data and even put our reads available so if someone wants to benchmark their variant caller they can do that like they don't have to do what we did but they can see if their variant color is good or not and so what we do is we have all these different variables shiny oh you know what okay so I think I put the advanced so we get the RSC's curves we can vary our p-value cutoff whether we do duplicate read you're not you know what kind of binomial model we apply the read position cutoff at the end all those and then we get a nice table and we can see how many false positives how many true positives I'm not going to Clarence it again and benchmark are so so kind of where we got our sweet spot is with the two-sided beta binomial the read position cutoff and then one thing is we don't call anything greater less than 0.4% so one in 250 so that's kind of as low as we can go and you can see yeah the ROC is a vertical line and so we can get down you can see from the table you know in our false positive column we get essentially close to zero false positives and we get pretty good sensitivity so this is this is kind of where we stop and get back to PowerPoint okay so then the last problem was virus input which is not an informatics it's another insurmountable problem for us right because I remember we're getting a swab out of someone's throat and we're lucky there's a lot of virus in there if we're not lucky there's not and if you think about it if you start with you know ten to the two genomes per microliter versus ten to the six genomes for microliter you're gonna have to go through more PCR cycle right and in making your library and that has the potential to introduce false positives you can't get around automatically we could try to zero in on those imply more stringent criteria but then our sensitivity goes in the toilet and so we think we know from our our SES that at ten to the fifth or above we can get zero false positive so in a lot of our measurements we're going to be focusing on sample that have higher higher amounts of virus in them and we're going to have be less certain about samples that have lower amounts of virus in them and that's just shown here so 10 to the fifth copies and a mixing study verses 10 to the 2 copies in a mixing study and that so before is tighter now it's genome copies by qpcr and then here's the specificity again so at 10 of the fifth copies we get you know perfection in terms of our specificity but as you get more applicant amplifications into pcr you start getting more false positives and then of course your sensitivity is going down because you're starting with less so your chances of finding a rare variant or less that's just something we can't do anything about but the important thing is we understand it and we know where the limits of what we can say are when we're looking at real human sample data so we are in the process of kind of putting this together and publishing it kind of as a standalone you know this is this is a benchmarking study of the variant caller and we're actually doing a couple variant callers and saying look the viral community you need to pay attention to this because it becomes kind of a data reproducibility and believe a literally issue and you know because there's a lot of studies of diversity but we don't we don't know because none of these things have been benchmark well whether the data is meaningful or not or whether people are making inferences based on noise so we're going to try to make it all publicly available what the reads up people can benchmark their own pipelines using our data because it the well kind of curated data set and so just finally I'll finish out with just a little bit of what we're doing with this variant caller one thing we're interested in is how does vaccination impact viral diversity and we're doing this in collaboration with Arnold Monto and Susannah omen at the School of Public Health and they actually ran the last placebo-controlled randomized trial of influenza vaccine you can't do it anymore because Universal vaccination is recommended so everyone's supposed to get a flu shot and you can't have people getting a placebo flu shot anymore but in 2006 2004 through to the 2008 it wasn't and so they ran a large trial with you know thousand sixteen hundred people in the vaccine arm three hundred and a placebo arm and saw who got influenza and these were generally University of Michigan students so they were fairly young healthy not they didn't have a vaccination history because it wasn't recommended in a flu shot and 20 year olds don't get flu shots anyway right and so you know there's no prior vaccination to mess things up so it's a as clean a data set as you're gonna get and so what Kerry is doing in the lab is you know the flu vaccine it works 60 to 70 percent of the time its efficacy so a large number of people get the flu shot still get the flu okay still get your flu shot but don't expect miracles and basically do the people who got the flu shot but still got the flu yet different viruses than the people who got the placebo and so what we've done is we've gotten these swabs out of the freezer and Illumina sequence them and applied our variant collar and here's just preliminary data just a few things we're working on so what we're looking at is by day of reported symptoms across the whole genome how many single nucleotide variants are we detecting in both the vaccinated arm and the placebo arm and then even then we're looking at a gene level so you might think an H a or na which are the surface proteins of the virus where your immune system target there might be differences whether you get the vaccine or not so we're looking at the data for that and then we're also looking for well are they following are these different viruses depending on whether you're in a vaccinated host or unvaccinated who is exploring different solutions right and so maybe there may be all the ones in the face of partial antibody response are evolving a certain way and sharing certain single nucleotide variants and what we've noticed is there are some signal nucleotide variants that are in most of our samples so they are common probably what was circulating in Ann Arbor on that year relative to the reference but then there's a number of them that are not quite private mutations they're not just in one sample but they're in a few sample and so that's something that we're going to be exploring further and then that brings me to another project which JT is working on is well if there's a certain number of variants that might be shared among a couple people can you use that to start looking at what's transmitted from one person to another right and the idea is this I just had a cold my four year old and six year old had cold before me right so they gave it to me right right it's the kids and I don't know how how many of your parents but that's the constant refrain oh my kids started going to school now got sick all the time is that fair I don't know could I have gotten sick from someone at work and it's just coincidence and so it would be nice to know can you use the sequence data to link people in transmission chain and essentially say yes by in using the sequence data and performing inference yes it's highly likely that your kid gave it to you or no let's let the kid off the hook and so JT is working on this hive cohort which again is run by a normal not oh it's Google Public Health there's about three hundred families of four or more in southeastern Michigan every year that they follow about a thousand fifteen hundred people they just follow them through the year any time someone gets sick they gets swab so there's a lot of rhinoviruses coronaviruses but then it's also influenza viruses and then about 50 or 70 a year you get two people in the same household within a couple days of each other who are sick and so what we're doing is we're sequencing all those viruses in household transmission putative transmission cases and across the cohort as a whole and then we're gonna look for shared variants and essentially say well you know essentially use that to make a distance matrix and say well if you share a number of these variants together it's highly likely that your length of the transmission chain as opposed to you know someone working at the bank you know the day you went there and so trying to get a sense of you know how confident are we that this household transmission of that happened because then like well if we have if we know a transmission of that happened and we know we can start defining what's going between one person and another and then we know some of these people are vaccinated so we could say with vaccination it's their title bottleneck do things change more and try to understand on that transmission project process and what we can do about it so read the early stages but it all has to start with informatics that you're confident in which is why we spent so much time on our sequencing pipeline because if we're going to do a secondary analysis data of the data you have to be sure that I married to solid so to summarize the influenza part of the work reliable detection of intra host single nucleotide variants is tricky no matter what you read in a paper it's tricky and ask questions and what works on a variant caller for human genomes or bacterial genome not the same as what works in a variant caller for an RNA virus it's even trickier to do this in clinical samples where you may have to do a lot more rt-pcr to generate your sequencing library than in a cell culture derived sample we developed what we think is a robust pipeline and like I said I think one of the big things that we're gonna be able to do is give this data set out through the community and people can I don't like your pipeline I'm gonna do a different pipeline they've got a data set that they can say okay we know how many true pods are we know where the false positives are and then we can optimize our pipeline it's like we did and then we're using this to move forward with studies of intra host diversity which are ongoing and hopefully a couple years I'll be able to tell you so I'll thank my lab I many of whom are right there I talked about Daniels work on coda shuffle JT on the pipeline and a little bit about carries work with the flu vaccine we have other interesting stuff going on that other people are working on Arnold Manto and Susanna omote are collaborators on the fluid stuff at the School of Public Health Ryan and your department who we wouldn't have been able to code on shuffle without him and you've been really fun to work with we got started with kind of framework of our pipeline with help from Chris and Peter at the bioinformatics core and then an explicit pick any question yeah or maintain predicted function right so change the primary nucleic acid sequence without altering things that might affect the overall function of the virus yeah so you know it just may be something to look at where you can copy and paste but there's kind of a whole area of protein design yeah where they do something very similar you may be able to copy and paste some ideas and so yeah they improve your results yeah yeah you mean in terms of like method logic because of course we're trying to keep the protein sequence the same just changing the nucleic acid sequence yeah yeah yeah because we want to keep the amino acid sequence the same yeah ah good yeah thank you so the question is uh we look at indents in our benchmarking and we just go like this within Dells because they're probably not as biologically common or relevant as in many other genomes right you know in particular right because a lot of the viruses it's like most of what it is it's like an open reading frame you throw an in Delon there it's essentially gone and they're probably pretty rare and they're really there's even more issues with detecting EndNote so we just said we're agnostic about in Della's that we're not going to study them at all maybe we're missing something but I think heading Katy would kill me if I told them to include in Dell detection very nice work early in the lecture you do a contrast between HIV virus and poliovirus of course a totally different molecular structures but from the variables that you study what are you able to correlate or explain in their evolution and their function yeah so it's not nothing how's that nothing all the money spent we haven't thought anything um I think the answer is there's probably a lot of things and so there's been a number of studies where people you know correlate various things you know evolution it because it basically it's a problem of mutation rate and evolutionary rate right the HIV has a much higher evolutionary rate and poliovirus or the substitution per site per year it evolved you know this then and and but the mutation rates are the same and there's a lot of things that go in bottleneck sighs you know demographics how many people are in the world are infected with poliovirus versus HIV you know the host size demographics like we saw this in the Ebola outbreak right the initial estimates of the substitution rate we're vastly different then later in the epidemic and it probably had to do with kind of the explosive you know burst when the epidemic started versus when it tapered off and then on the on kind of the basic nuts and bolts of the virus I think there's probably a lot of things I think mutational tolerance is one of them but even there's probably variation in nutation rates across it you know I maybe the envelope sequence of HIV has a different mutation rate than you know an internal protein and maybe the virus is able to talk has more loops and there's more tolerant of mutation loops and you know how the proteins are structured it's probably affecting it too so I think I I doubt I mean I presented it as mutational tolerance is gonna be everything but I bet I bet each virus is gonna have like five different things that you know build on its mutation rate and affect how it evolved so I think you should that the false positive variants tend to disputes towards the end of the sequence but there was a small bump in the middle to Kenny's bling why is this my bomb no I so the ones that'll be in the middle right will be so the point I was trying to make on I glossed over it with Kennedy ends because probably this audience knows that a quality score of 30 does not mean I bet that it doesn't mean that there's one in a thousand chance of as a mutation there and certainly our data show that a quality of score of 30 on an end of the read it's not mean the same thing at the quality of score of 30 in the middle of a read right because we had Q 30 base calls on the end that were false right and so that was an important thing but then your question specifically it's like well in the middle those are high quality bases himat quality scores they're like you know they're they look real right and we're calling it false positives because they're not expected right we know xx true positives and we're calling everything else false they could be rt-pcr errors they could be that one in a thousand with a quality score 30 you know that happens enough times that we can detect it and I think that's it's kind of like - like the viral Heisenberg uncertainty principle at some point you just can't get any closer to its certainty that's something real or not and so we're calling it a false positive it might be a true positive and so our goal is basically just been to get it read it rid of those many false positives that we can and some we're just going to be after like they we're pretty sure they're real and leave it at that yeah but there's no informatics signal that we're like okay those false positives in the middle have this characteristic because if we knew that we would have you know figured a way to filter them out that answer your the influenza vaccine versus a placebo in fact you didn't dwell on the results but I think that it did you show when you looked at him agglutinin that the diversity was larger and yeah in the placebo yeah this is largely by in around with data you know and I glossed over it a little bit so because we've improved our variant calling pipeline we've improved our primary data analysis since the secondary needle analysis that we haven't redone the secondary this is kind of teaser we did find that there was more diversity on day four I think it was and hemagglutinin in vaccinated versus placebo but we need to go back now with what we've learned in the last three months and redo the secondary analysis because we've gotten better at the primary analysis so it could be that some of this signal goes away which is exactly the point we're trying to make to the communities like primary data has got to be really good those are the questions were interested in because we're like well gee that would be kind of cool right if vaccination affects the diversity on him pollutant that would be you know we'd be excited oh yeah thank you
