in our package that we've been working on for for analysis of whole genome DNA methylation my sequence I stay here for a year and enjoy the time here miss Department so today I'm talking about you know the the new developing where the tools so you know analyzing the methylation so channel methylation which it's a skill you know ongoing a little bit and wrong about you know this nation for the CPG sides you know some the policing in fact refers to the you know these psyching 5 carbon of you know CPD side can receive you know the methyl group so when it received methyl group we say it is methylated this methylation is really gross in even a normal self development for example in methylation reasoning a CTD psyche and promoter region you know now prevent you know this gene expression and even you know in cancer sample you know it's a lot of study shows very different you know methylation patterns so you know it's in normal here have different appellation and this you know methylation in general regulate gene expression so it plays very important role something like all expression that oncogenes all it's important so you know the goal for us is try to you know find wait 60 series they are really for the two different groups different issues there if you're instantly methylated so current method it's a you know sequencing method we have several different type so here is some ink at least two there's not based on us this is array based probably and not based on not spin seeing all you know we don't have the information about this coverage and the trees here it's two different type one ISM you know whole genome and another you know the tightest the use of patient myself a sequencing is targeted some you know the CPG dense region because you know we have more information on that we don't want to spend a lot of money on some you know it's a CPG really rare in all that reason it's a slight different and we're you know all methods focus on these so the what is myself eighty said you know the researchers find the 20ma treated with I sulfate so here's maca ladies unmethylated so when you treated these of bisulfate and this the cytosine changed zero zero and you know if you using the sequencing a sequencer then it's read as the Simon shining so if there is some methylated this convergence is still so as you know see that means we if we you know it's base um the bisulphate technology along with external reasons using technology we can study you know the methylation difference I learn single city side so currently two papers one is a smooth another one in that case it's in the same journal at the same time thank you the same easy so the one is a piece moves is based on I mean we have Cochino you know the methylation read we changed a TCP decide but they assume there is some reason but they don't really have something is I proud reason they believe here you know being similar so all you know they have some really distinctive patterns so that it that is reason they use a smoothing you know technology but they didn't provide any you know statistical values use this has people reach out to adjust or to define their CPG or differentially methylated in Ossipee decide and another one is called metal case they used to do very simple only model and they have a bus but we found you know today some Panther in fact they based on binomial that maybe I need they didn't consider their recent if you look at the methylation rivers than you can find you know they change for example or even there are similar cancer like seeing some type of email there at least in reaching the same single-cycle different so we need to consider how to incorporate not the perimeter oh you know how to change our model to identify how to incorporate this information give us better understanding if there's an ethic reason so for example this is a mental case model lazy so being usable just progressing so you know for that they only have two groups and in this case if we look at the data so I already mentioned about you know this is coverage this is you know the number of CT size the CPG know the psycho series so you have you know this looks like binomial proposing we're trying to identify the proposal so in this case if you look at you know the final result so this seems like the side - yeah differentially methylated I'm here you know if this one is different trees so here if we calculate the based on listen you know I know your model okay see is thirty percent seven percent and thirty-four percent seventy one percent but this guy probably also reason but each book how the data itself you can see that you know the police really different it's almost zero almost one so this case if we we are thinking if we use you know this a binomial model we probably have you know even significant p-values base situation but you really read the data seems like they're probably not different immaculately it varies across the samples so this is some kind of motivation which I - no more focus on this type of TMC's every semester eight sides instead of this pixel be non-homogeneous though two years right she said I mean sit because we are which I to consider any two different group general we are comparing the mean of two we are not I - we need to consider you know varies between different it turns into not in Paris so the goal is we try to develop you know the tools we can use both in you know reduced sequencing and also we tightly not considered that's the coverage still give us that good you know the estimation of a single size of a single sample we need to use these average informants a long ways so another one is we try to know like this most they they combined different I mean they believe you know the smooth change we also you know some somehow we also believe you know that relation reached it smoothly change your profits m4 so we we you know also even often this system could freeze so we have you know this is our some kind of beta so we have a buried here so let's then percentage I think 25 percent you know frequency sees we methylated proposing and we have one top base kind of beta that we use this is this type of data to do that so the whole approach approaches are a bit of binomial meaning you're thinking about you know the Santos series they have proposed and pi2 proposing pie and it's a binomial distribution so they say as I mentioned it is you know the metal case binomial model you believe all the key eyes are the same for the different sample but we put another parameter that means we we don't believe you know the different different sample they have an exact same information trees they're from some kind of you know the distribution instead of exact so we consider these you know abusing reasons we say so it is also called a binomial is a binomial beta mixture so we have a complete formula and you know the PMF here and we have you know the new ice it is some another parameter here we just you know repair ties this Mooji because we are interesting this new G instead of alpha beta then we we have a test suite with has better you know the you knew I found this so we use some some approximation method instead of exact matter we have like leery so test but you know then we we try to do exact like original test then we need to estimate to premiere simultaneously that is not that easy considering we have over mailing them meaning it's in social but you know and maybe you have mailing decide that it mounting so we try to use that approximation in fact you know even the exact successful method the likely reason test that is also approximation so you don't know the exact distribution of that stood approximation so why you don't use another props missus really similar to that you know computing time very reason we considered you know the weird estimating i comparing the least difference so in this sense our dispersion kind reserve uses parameter so we asked me that uses parameter first and based on this news is primary to do the Microsoft ask but before that I mean if you read estimate this theta then we can approximate this normal distribution Oh Chi Square 1 distribution that is a normal square distribution instead we used we has to me this is person parameter first so it's not analogous to the you know the two-sample t-tests right if you do the two tests two sample t-test based on the estimated parents and I use T to distribution so t square distribution so we consider of that and we adjust the this sub statistic proximate bad with this then we will see that you know the P values based on our method quite cracked instead of my mute yeah I never saw that in the later so another one I said you know we can you know incorporation of the information so for example I try to estimate them this methylation reads you know do the past based size but you know I can I try to incorporate some other you know this size formation that means I can use them this week function I don't need basic insight exactly the same way to gave you know the the closer one movies are from you know they side last week then I can use this date promises this weekend like I could function can estimate that he said this person tracker so our methyl kids give you an overview of our mental case already so that you put data here so we have bunch of input data different conditions to be ever read functions we read this data and then income that you know and so data format used in our method and also didn't make them this one so we can also file data that means instead of we do then you know the single site data analysis we can also tie on some reason the data then we can do the tiled analysis we can also have you know the combined local innovations in the past and innovation of based you know difference in math you later analysis this is all main function except that because we think you know it's really good to give some annotations so help research biologist to enter data in this sense we have also provide a notation and also detailed visualization and we also included you know the enrichment test you know we try to consider [Music] transcription factor binding site so which is person factor binding site in reached identified different method is it easy so I will is based on over dictation and you know it's a second you that I'll get a new so choose so to estimate our you know that the values we paid you know communication that means we have if that we have twenty-one payable samples then we are each in each DVD side we have 20 up to 21 we just randomly mute so this pair cities up here and you know covered pair can go to another place let's not go to another somewhere communities each side we use different commuting number switch goes to different suicide that means after I do this mutation what we expect is no difference right because I commuted everywhere so then that is you know the mouth is abused so we try to think about I mean calculate them the p-value space the whole method and other method based on phenomenal we see what happens whether it is because you know under the now the distribution of the p-value so here is a comparison of two men third one another one black one is over so we have expected p-values a lot of meanings of you know the size so we under the you know the uniform still you know small p-values this is a rescue is love tank varios and this is expect along and p-values we hope you know the two key values the there in this expected line so we can see that you know our all method and the number of samples here is poor and up to 21 right up to 21 here you can pretty much sure after you know we have more than six maybe seven and our people is that means our you know the adjustment of p-values cracked but to consider you know them if you really based on binomial distribution because we really found you know DVD our ml samples they even at the same speed aside the methylation reason different by different that means you know their hitter a genius in this Georgina's case if you use the matter really based on I mean they're homogeneous then the type one error so how exactly is that I put you know the four part here's number of simple side for 10 15 and 20 ones everywhere okay this time but the expectations in here that means I need a check this one so we can find if you based on the binomial model in this writing on it her genius situation you always found about 41% of the CPD site identified as a you know difference to methylate reason it's based on FDR slicing 0.05 that means these metal kids have in this situation but ours so now there is some data analysis based on over you know 21 email samples I know we can identify the two sort of samples in three groups and also we have a normal sample so the we know the mutation here is eight eight one two and the tattoo we know this you know the people in the conversion of the DNA methylation so then and also you know we from the biological reason we know most be hyper methylated instead of hyper methylated and we have another group ml group it is you know mo one Ito fussen you know cancer this one we expect they don't have we need data analysis be some normal yes we H ones and twos so if you think this black one is from our method and this one from the binomial model we defined that MCS are less than standard police difference if there is an appellate reason so what we found as we expected because you know our binomial model exaggerated the type 1 error so they found much more differentially methylated size compared to our matter and what is interesting here yes we expected anyway you know and another one is even based on other publications about this to mutation so page 1 to mutation and to mutation the a lot of researchers find you know this one as a you know severe effect on the DNA methylation so that means you should expect any fun boards see different ethnicity side in base countries compared to this so we also find this but if you use a mental case of binomial model it seems like you know if you like you know this one I think you know they didn't gave them because you know the EDB type 1 errors do not crack so that they included a lot of so we also have these are all relative to normal yes so so any ideas of why a site so much larger than especially these truly means this one so if you look you have sites third is hyper and hypo yes and then the others nowhere close the total number not close or three so you could either just look at hyper or the total in the total I think it's um Steve I mean they have different effect so this stands probably Emma one oh you know it's disrupted effect so you can find explain why there's so one and text to are involved in the demethylation process so so when those either of those is mutated the cells have trouble D methylating and so you expect the great majority of changes to hyper month - there's a couple other Tet proteins that can partially compensate for the loss of its activity and so that's why we don't see as high of a ratio for tattoo as for h1 h1 or to that kind of completely loses okay so we I said you know we have another options so we can complicate pretend we have we can use notes you notes we found even here when you compare normal and edit one or two cancer sample in general they have both Virginia's normal so we we are thinking if we use you know that you use a variance estimate from the normal and we combine the local information where you know the you know she might have microarray data at least most so we you know we have I said you know we have the 504 I mean we try to think about whether we really classify all we can identify clustering this you know or different sub time but normally to resit different subtypes that based on our you know the EMG is so I did you know analysis based on 1413 cancer sample to normal they'd you know they found tons of emcs and I based on these TMC's Mentalist on these DMC's I did you know clusterings this is a color based on correlation of you know the differential methylation to decide that one so it's pretty nice and seems like you know custom pretty well I checked you know the label here it's amazingly well this is one group which one to in another group tattoo actresses but now really high here the weight is really high that bixton is really high but still you know only one this one looks more like reason I think we really use you know the ones we so stable parents then we can probably help cancer sample so next one is um compared the it is some you know p-values and they some difference so you can see that over you know things in that I put you know that the FDR 0-5 we can identify about you know 0.63% as you know I think the find that the end EMCC if we only consider you know FDR statistic volume of these statistics so this five and I think this is probably reason you know the developer of this sub method they need to use point five twenty five percent here then think these two parts can be identified VMC's they don't include because you know the too many sides so that is wrong 0.51 and then they were reduced from 40% reduced to that they this included about 80% that we only if we also use you know the 25% cut point but then we really you know understand so another one is an imitation help you know you understand which region you have much more founded the energies so for all the CPD's sides which i used to identify the mcs you can find you know about 50% from that island but this proposal goes to 62% you know more the cancer to regions i think here is really you know the CPC size six the island they have you know the distorted CPG methylation but another one is that in general you have much more power methylation difference the same reason i think you know as for the intergenic region another one is we interpreted these two the gene body so another I talked about you know the enrichment of transcription factor binding size and this is comparing the NH one to patient to the then we found based just one factor finding size so only one is highly significant and because it's this Wow it's really related and you know seems like you know the finding is consistent do you do any correction for the sequence composition of the binding sites what well you have a lot of CDs in there they have an opportunity to be already sort of it what I dated some you know for each CPG finding sides frankly how won't possibly have more size there and what I did is we have all you know potential CPC side I count how many you know the cpt side here and EMG so I'm a p.m. she's there so we really checking the proportion of the RCPD side that is used to identify the PMC's as you know other side say you don't have so for all of it including and compared to the total number of CPC side and the number and map-21 you know been finding side I compared the proportion of the map and total from the so it's really you have a lot of size here and you always looking at the proportion of motion tested CPG sites that are significant overall versus overlapping with that so another did have Jason here we have to hire with the legislation functions here so if we here I think we included all chromosome 19 then you can find miss red one is MCS identified but if you join me in some then you can see more information here so here sort of give you some ideas what is the you know the estimated mean mean and here is uh another group roomies and also we have a CPG Island Mississippi Jersey Shore this is the genes monthly income this is you know the and also related to the so summary for the DMC I think you know the comparing to that third one better binomial and binomial functional binomials and to be influenced by the coverage you have that area that one is really and but you know elemental fantasy is more likely to take the side face you know the large methylation change instead of high coverage and it's a binomial model they don't consider their recent between examples and they also identify the site is really high variance between samples with our system even sort of consider that if you have really large variance between sample than we put this one here we sort of try to understand why we need to local information here so the first part is autocorrelation methylation region so it's a autocorrelation is correlation to the max2 means you know next snacks and all you know recently next 100 then you can see that it feels like you know it's all about 200 here or 300 living apart seems like you know it's pretty highly correlated so it appears I can only try to really use the so the this one is a little messy in itself a correlation of estimating this person planner but you know I doubt please and I think it's um it's more like the same pattern about here but you cannot have really had her destiny bearings so we really do the operation of the bearings those of the variance of the variance you don't have a height you know high correlation and that also means some sense you know estimate but they still have a similar pattern to look at you know and they have kind of this is also give us some some sense I mean maybe we still can use them so all matter here we try to provided our package we have several here done and you know we have a binomial pros they sell mostly and the enrichment test and in the pink of visualization also a time I think discuss you know what is the best way to give we want so paper is I'm going and we need to do working on many so we see you know introduce me this project so I really crazy and also to collaborate the data writing paper together okay you get this result and said oh well they think maybe this thing is classified just wondering if you could pick up stuff and say well that's kind of what our normal only analysis is trying to get at that is subsides penciling you are genius I think you didn't explain how we got the site's yes yeah we we included we I mean we're comparing the normal whole bunch of side assuming we don't be virginia's unarmed - and we identified a lot of DMC's we only use this DMC's - I mean the information in this the Embassy's classified quite so so it's not just the MCS it's TMC is using only the normals estimating the variance level among those really the assumption that they're gonna have seen so so it allows heterogeneity among tumor samples so that it could be that only a subset of the tumors you don't differentially methylated at this site because the normal samples tend to be much more homogeneous yeah so the same using only the sites that you identify by estimating the variance using only the normal samples you're able to classify these lots of times any prior knowledge and the the idh1 - yeah we just learned today that one also has some additional mutations that are at least one known to be important in which could make them look that means this one really you know that one idh1 - is an outlier not just in terms of methylation boss on terms of genetic mutations well that's but we were able to separate out IDH detects - in the ITO yes instead of clustering you're reducing everything to the lumber you've actually played in the victory is there a correlation of looking more site by site through the we started taking some it's from this information you could pick out what are the top sites then then actually distinguish these come up with the lower dimensional classifier in other words detecting within something that is called so that would be hard to say is there more variance in where they expect I guess could be variability could come from various sources I had to say that it comes from you need not oh I don't know more after but you did not get this separate cluster if you just used all DMC's using both groups there were several yes good
