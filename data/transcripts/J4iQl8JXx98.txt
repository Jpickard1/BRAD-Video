doctor sorry in software engineering he's working companies he's once twice Awards outstanding service award for I see IBM in Indianapolis and got a Pharma Foundation researcher award at the is MB in 2012 in Long Beach that's really great he's also been involved in the violent Maddox core capabilities including single-cell sequencing in San Antonio has an interest in that we heard in court facility management and he's under consideration for the faculty director for the violent from attic floor to work with me anything um Thank You Victor for coming we look forward a stop okay thank you doesn't help me okay good so thank you Brian and a June you know in the opportunity for this position glad to be here it's not first time but opportunity that future and so yeah I would like to talk about the research including the lab and and there so a malaya if you usually mainly use the integrated experiment and the competition approach each exam the transcriptional regulation in the genome of course application motion of cancer and a little bit of basic knowledge I guess most of people you already know but the comment in biology and so we know the energy notes repealing DNA not naked right so it will wrap around the neutrals of chromatin new column and make a dance commonly so but that the basic unit is called neutral zone which composed of a eight histone you need to copy off or h-2a h-2b h3 at or which is eight cookie makers wrong and DNA will let up Obama's is the nuclear zone called core neutral zone and of course there's another call each one is told which link come to DNA cami and then they come out so definitely you know nine history and the compose new chrome and because of you know pokey chemistry and order the nuclear dome is not just a longer shape but also there's a pair of tortured aside there's a core he's compared you know of course each copy histone has a tear and there's even a number he likely you know if you started if genetic if you see a lot of h3k4 and the concealer because the light under HSV histone the number four and number nine number twenty seven seventy nine is the mostly modified and the linker to functional that's why lie now in the field most people starting in a tree or because they can modify in different methylation and and then you know can consequences functional so also we know this is chromosome and cuz it is a typical the structure new kagome histone and a DNA methyl a DNA you can you know because we can modify it by different chemical they actually so we we know they're the appalachian methylation you'll be finishing stimulation and the perspiration and combined often people call this the histone code i of course the histone code 'you don't really include any level that's why usually now we can change it we you know you include DNA different the methylation right now we know DNA also explains different the methylation stuff like by Hagi arbitration and that's why we sometimes recall his epigenetic a core studies is really core as fundamentally addressed the principle of commenting regulation so and open you know people just the study you know DNA one linear fashion promoter enhancer and but that we know this is not a case like so far transcriptional regulation not just a one time measure and also sweet imagine so still there's a two separated theory you know still a group of people thinking still use a linear fashion you can record a gene from sample year to 2 K 3 K 10 K Wade enhancer is linear squeeze the model can push the transition style promoter but most people accept that model is the sweetheart measure which you have a enhancer element and protein complex we to promote it in concert together and the like energy is cause retardation model cause my lab of course working on this model and instantly and now current the challenges which you I talked about unity with the discussed with individual faculty or people single cell level how to address single cell level chromatin regulation we know there are many students they are transcriptome there are not many epigenetic regulation repair so there are many you know sequencing technique there often we call army like if you see the army or make a steak so there's so many a knowledge of a bear and the slides of course only lists the portion of them and also important of them and you know I started working on chip stick and you know way back in 2000 Taylor and starter you know just Illumina poster generations equal T and and also recently we have a chipper act so if you notice the chip at the photo go and we also have a bit of water in this area and empty cap a lot work in a lab and and hi-c another in ant work of course it should drape my sake but I won't go to all the work like that many our folks are some of worker ongoing in my lab so this slide summarized pretty much you know competition Atul and developer in my lab apart I don't know how many here including my postdoc near so basically some is already published and some not and I can cross by there the two major category in the about to why is the upstream another tube which is really we execute the call and be a PI equal mask or node and mostly just be like working out you know sequencing data and so these were you know we have a big and empty tactic chip actor IP anything and also their downstream monastic which is the people must also look at the past winner is network and our faith and we also have a beautiful work in lab at this kind of especially I would talk about a little bit he stopped at work and also the kind of program and a couple slides showing you know already online and our lab website in public and I don't have time talked about this one I beat the prepared slide to illustrate try to do in a vision talk vision did the division talk to who our side and also visualize making to the already public is to still and you know preparation just got to stop okay utilize an increment that really different that they pay and so for applying for this talk I go into toggle sweetheart I hope a library or the and the Padawan is talk about company Tori its genetic a pattern and the second one with no maker interaction which IP work and this is the transition in the UK zone and relationship with so this part we already published a kind of proof of concept paper in bioinformatics to try to demonstrate a hidden Markov model to to decipher the company Tory even a histone mark or a PNA methylation and the regulated pattern which is kind of epigenetic a comb and the sis is in the album of a bill for to stop it under protection and the Cicely so I won't go to so be here and basically you know a bunch of chips ik data you're being itchy your based on the ticketing term as a pic you know and it's a partial distribution determine either way actually hold r101 yellow and if you have a7 chip sick data then you typically you have a to to server 128 kind of a code you know like a you look kind of for the binary code you know and then you use a hidden Markov model to truly get a combinatorial property so the other of course in the future there are some tools already is the he Tomica model and published and we have a different our elaborate little bit more of this difference why we still see the macro model that we're one of course algorithm itself different the otherwise we also can see the tree fact top of which is that he stole mark because we found that if you don't can see that you are in fact in the beginning of common key combination you miss a lot of the information so that's our alcohol use and then we use the one typical data at least the EPS mir-2 to training all these together some dot typically you know is itchy you know competition to you need a some data to demonstrate so we'll call this the particular to we use the called tcf7l2 and there is the downstream when you think the retention factor there are many people working on this to factor to take cheap and but not really because so far the they found only these two factors involved many disease but most of the colon cancer diabetes and but the the exact mechanism still largely unknown right so we still working a lot on distance you factor at arrangement very important its other I think is under started in a few divided people more but this is really important a factor so if you look at the data so we cleaning 5/6 of cancer cell line that we all have our own chips Big Data performed by the week any started with clearly 25 state then we we after training 25 we have a second step because you know you have a lot of MPD's state by basically a one stage the whole bunch of 0 so we remove all these you know fellow state eventually we get a 18 state then once we have 18 states and we will be wrong the data again and you'll get a more improved profitability so the parity emission figure is look like that so basically you know you have a 18 stage as a different actor mark and we also included five six line so if you need to cut off or basically use the pointer to point three you basically typically you can infer some poverty in each of the yep take so in this case the cat like better many program they didn't uniquely consider that as a factor that's why we typically spread our result in to Google wines the cheerful or rain today the other ones not cheerful that's very important because we really don't care in this case non cheerful state right we want to be out here tcf7l2 regulated epigenetic a pattern so we indeed and we found a poor state significantly quality to this factor and so if we look at that four states they are distribution and the genes Ferrari and the CG content or other genomica future then you can derive say you know a conclusion Stage three is basically the promoter state you look at it you know heavily distributed in five Prada and the status nine basically nam company basically everything there right so not much you know Pauly D and if you look at a state in ever have a distributed in gene body but if you Daniel to look at that the states in ever the mark indeed in ever you have a poverty elongation mark definite eleven state is enhancer but if income Kanakadasa and the state and fourteen is a distributor distal so this is a hysto club are should you know each state distribution if he buys the online we nine because we're basically nine not apology Hey they clearly you see the mg7 painting one you have enough or distributions read it in a state but we try to look at it this one because the some states that you don't really have energy so we ignore these so in the next few slides we have any concentrate analyze look at this to their life how this charge in fact record is cancer phenotype so then we look at you know being correlated to this entity online is where : notation and online a lot as well now see indeed that we found out being mc7 see online encounter and intragenic in Kentucky English them seven candles Emma and Daniel's a ten to one that G co-editor Yuen Li chitta thank you once they alive that's very good you know really demonstrate our true in a founded fish out of the gene enhancer and this thing on tender is anything related to specific and this issue to some common theme and disease choose the gene expression you need if you look at the if you remember this the promoter intragenic enhancer eastern contra clearly we see these the stately lever is in Chong Kanaka after exposure Lee the highest right so that's that you can order by many tools also you know you have HS 337 a sadistic elongation tannic I'm not really people use the competition approaches to reporter actually this enhancer mark contributor more transcription activity to the genus portion so this is the typical you know ago annotation I won't go too deep here to deliver flight and then we compare to feel the desert mainly Tuesday amid then you know certificate to meditator to labrum I came and bit away then we found only our tools we can pound that PCEHR for associate a typical pattern 311 40 all the night or this tool because they want a design to really darken see that there for our children practice you know so they only can you know he tell me some of course a lot of commenting state are really not that he's been actually fact basically kadar Khan money but of course we want to do more comparison this is not enough like we want to decide to that state is doubtful we also wanted to look at the IOC look at we are working on with a little bit of more work then we you know a students are like say the beautiful wet lab validation by ourself and we in this light we you know this experiment that we did that two different experiment why is the over expressed that the appellant one is not completed both demonstrate ever a fact the other apology lee we also want a bad day to compare states 11 which is the intron Kanaka encounter and the state of 14 history casa indeed which one's the contributor hi children activity so if you look at a first slide very simple tip if you are you know select nine ten eleven key and indeed all the G and the B if you use the doc down and which you compare I don't if you guys clearly is the first one is the control and promoter and knockdown promoter and a stateless basically states eleven states three comparison so if you look at the highest of change is a gigantic ax so if you compare this to you'll see clearly if you're not going to see have seven through that country in fact that in enhancer intergenic enhance of states that dramatically change all this you know statistic into a sense that it was significant and there is three triple triple triple K and this is actually a likes but I don't know this one but the most views are are lupus reactivity the natural activity like this in your structure promoter indeed those experiment demonstrate in transgenic a house indeed the contributor to at high factor so all this was experiment looks like a simple but demonstration our to also rather the biology say indeed intragenic encounter actually contributor so another study case that would be the little bit early is the estrogen receptor we know this factor seventy percent of all breast cancer has yah beef and the many people work out with good in my career I have many many work and religious I just assure a video program it's getting you know into estrogen hormone in cricketer receptor and initiate the transcription regulation and the in this study case they usually you know another cooperate and we used to say on line one to enter seven and we can even chemical resistance with both thank you this orchard secret data and did a few years ago and if you look at the way we have a minimal 11:9 mark and we have a Caroline we have a almost 110 million you know in that state that many years ago how do 10 million is a lot or they know like it now just half that right but that calm we take each 11 in like 4 million number j1x not only like a pitch low only produced before nearly 5 million at that time but now of course we pick a lot of luckily utilize this data at the publishing world and so regardless you know we have a hundred ten delete airline and given the mark then also you send you know program of regard and the we in this case we have a DNA methylation closest restate methylation related Oh promoted so then we also do the same kind of pathology look at each state's the collated to the future promoter in cancer and we found out there the four five states actually related the estrogen regulation I won't go too deep here and also and you look at the simple communication same you know stay both states want but the deal macular totally different gee I didn't you know one diagram but this set of genes this set of the HIPAA all those opposed to belong to a promoter state of wonky so is this demonstration you know and you know this program can identify in different cancer type and gene regular by they're part of specific epigenetic electrically this odd basically you know we give our babies the epigenetic attune and can exam you know company to rate the associated in fact pattern and also chemistry 45 data set the pike and Ruthie online and to like a experiment invalid data group concept and so we also attended by you know if York State was cancer and resistant black cancer state so now I agree a second apart so this is you know I'm going party some published and still collect the data and show a little bit so again you know one paper will publish an apology or indeed a nuclear as a research a code a high C P little bit different than the hack so you know if you're not kind of aware of the high C I in a little bit okay stop so basically you know you use some kind of cutting enzyme and there are the many people in the current but opposite this particular case the first paper published in 2009 I found your back lab and that they use their industry in one other one and usually pushing your captor as long as this enzyme can recognize these six mark you cut it and then you lightly you label it at the cutting side and you can use another enzyme to like it it this is typically the trick part is how to efficiently put on this part because when you technically you can cut the many amenities kind of piece like kind of cheese steak you know you put a lot of or random and then how do we fish out of this so but also another important step that will look I the secretly has to be payable right because with care and and you can see one really one commenting fragment from one side the other one thumb then you can use this little information enrichment can pick out a wealth basically you want to look at it this portion the calories Allah we don't know that is so my students online did a few years ago and he come up with this strategy and basically recoveries Linda you know once we get the data of quality few to the data and pay our end you have a sweet gift of the ligation then finds with a lender and you're the one called self looping there one interesting what you're actually the pilot the leading port called proximity ligation the basically you have a trick compact neutralizer can drag a true component so of course ideally this is you know promoter enhancer like later on we will show some data this interaction not necessary promoter enhancer can be anywhere promote a promoter promoter enhancer and enhancer so basically this first scenario under heat developer and then stock in Apple device this algorithm basically we called a validator auto sonic of recommend so then we use kind of when you know expedition my issue with crappy to fish out a possible like a shoe event and and eventually we get a significant sets of watching it will you look at this graph or you can see you know we alternate really different like Asian that is the green wine actually significant not from different of recomment also from different income car cousin you know the harmony of course waiting to the you know modeling Danita how many actually the income comes part there you can know where it's accurate so so basically we model that possibly know like a she then the we spirit is actually awesome mixture distribution and then we look at the random like a ship isn't follow beta decay back lumber so because you have this chu studies a model based on different estates that then you can input this is actually a clock and you can use a statistical model inference to see fish outta this with that so of course it's just then we use a pastor popularity that there are many many public and we all utilize a lot of them and we presented deepen the sequencing path from early stage only you know Emily and now they have a feeling they still there and so we all passed them the five practices the part offender FDR and shows the course of dependency can see that you get a different treatment and we compared to some coban I have to know today no clip art or although we compare to other people but they are this close to hormone and a high-speed Carver not really actually studies the model that hoga so but they do claim you know you can use the hi-c data and can regard is the resolution or what then you can't and if I recommend actually they are interaction so we utilize these two although they are not earth that is a model and a we compare the catalyst we we compare the hi-c car through very successful and the homo also a little bit of a lot because the difference is the hormone of organs out they'll require this is a 20k P so we imagine each if recommend sometimes we can be 30 40 K interaction for okay so I want you know Braca massage that goes our long 2 K 2 and K okay so because if you look at this slide you know this recommend if this can be variable by depends if instead and cutting enzyme efficient but the human self didn't do good job the catalyst is a complicated so there also we compared to primary replicate our two we also very get very lucky the participation attitude almost 65 that the but we are also working on you know different FDR the harmony I give you this flap you have this graph and clearly you know you treat up you have certain FDR and so the of a lap three the barrel same as chips if you walk out you take it simply it depends a p-value FDR and you can get dip in a set of a peak and then importantly you leave the balance static the value and and we also come continue to look at the to sample for example that's also important to many you know investigator one know not just one condition also compare different US airline or different the condition mostly condition and a we user or lambda topic and the distribution characterizes two different cell piper clearly you know this is empty server this is the time to one or this is Jen you know as a differentiation finally size 1 size exact the same and we use this model roughly approximate their type specific interaction wine out the lab is we are validated you know they is not only interlocking a gym we already have a started working on the validation you know they definitely question so then we further you know it has that because all these two both say online at the latter for epigenetic data there so we take advantage of this the public at data because the our self our own data then we look at the this is the like I mentioned that if you based on the gene structure like promoter one promoter to and this one promoter one one second let me see ideally you know most people think you just though you know wanting interacting only promoter right Easter but reality we have a lot of data shows the promoter one came into our promoter to and promoter one can enjoy to promote mr. to so we then this is distribution approval majority people want but we also see a lot of people to intercept and you look at a special mark this is a promoter mark this is a encounter mark we did in promoter really is a more engaged at least remark enhancer the immediately visiting counselor so in line with our category and we also look at a jinx portion indeed you see promoter in hospitals for sure is much higher than random T so all above below about one actually so if you know that jinx partially people express love to lay low this indeed all the enhancer promoting enhance interaction feel it's about one so so now I talk a little bit as a static case this one's in k562 this is because this is the kill one in CODIS online they're the many many data or so they're the hi-c data that's why we work out with you send a one we identify you know April chromosome this will psych psych hold part included both in gigantic ax and in the chromosome in Tacoma and in Tacoma this is actually within chromosome we totally tended by a woman 19,000 of course we omitted this data literally no idea that's a poster data from your back Rupa and we like look at is that we able to you know welcome this $90,000 into luxury we correlated to many many histone mark post a week how likely Class B interaction one why you try to you always have to size effect 100 so one threatening to or lose a tooth and they get loose typically you just caught in one side you got that from castor one you typically entity if it's really mark that's understandable you know there's still a lot of leaking no epigenetic annotation yet and then we simply correlation to site of one so you see clearly if you have this market in one side you have another mark in this side so commenting that you share the to look closer share very similar community environment of course it's not 100% while your clay also see another hundred percent he is we so maybe in like theta it's the post party or maybe and information here why we can't make any conclusion and the catalyst which we share very similar vomit on both sides and this is the engagement and that more interesting if you because encoder they're the management in fact that you so this ought to nurture Pacific data is not like a bit of a predictor and so if you you know this is the classroom podcaster then you correlated to costing with the 45 chip stick data and K in k562 clearly you can get the enrichment certain change in fact in certain clock by the reputed he clearly or this was pretty fearful at 12:31 you guys would know that is to involve a cohesion complex chromatin structure also within the vida one cluster and we also look at the other one kata to really clearly is the active roster so this is a change in factor frosting and network all the bumpy 45 cent factor and some you know more time to look past based on the k562 a special comes up and then we did get that were calculate them so clearly you know we are able to program able to post class by the high C to interaction then correlated to epigenetic mark then correlated changing factor you know then we look at the expression and also we found there's a two typical commenting linking or cook with and humble commenting proper right get a bunch of potential factor or committees largely over there so basically if you look at the postal those are one loose of our lives are to ecology so like I said that you know we not necessarily know someone else or to correspond same team if you look at the previous slide they may be to present a to diplomatique so that's why I jeans partially not open to say a recovery solution wanna lose a to the jeans partially is that high in this class is higher than landed by you this a casa it's an ocean liner so we can call this little class cluster this is active Acosta so in the here we missing one caster often people talking about is the piyo buried alive all but in another data set that we need be the founder those are one loose are to not necessary in same train like so easily really caught no but but uses data that we didn't follow these other you know jeans pattern they should have have that so then we further you know use the validation and simply knockdown kata want a tattoo to perform I may speak by ideally of course will also ask that why don't you knock down through the high speed at that time we don't really have this technology lab yeah we just competition coming up first so the way we did actually can prove some sort of for that issue because we we we fish out there after you know 25 color one color to cross a liturgy this portion G indeed some involved a loopy but some not but we also identify some nothing to do with the loopy right that's also understandable because the first on we not really cut a tree cutter to knock down the hi-c data secondary you know hi-c data itself and all really high frequency so both this case with the catalyst you know we sort of bad data indeed is gotta to Karawang in regular sweet 3d comedy regulation so first I have another case this is really angry in the lab we just finish it generated some calls estrogen treated the data this time of course we have our own technology well lady mature can do right away and the TCC and so we again and Susanna into like said whoa and also we have a five hand called Tantillo is advocated 0 1 1 hour per hour 15 24 hour and also compared I'm not so resistant Allah so because we wanted to ponder what come out the resistance test airline what a committee structure different why I'm sweetie to a class the resistant that's and really I think that we have the first one you look at this particular power can toboggan and see if you look at the load way each time we almost get there you know close in front of milling tail end like so imagine of course there lie now frequently not cheaper a look at Elizabeth that's still a lot of people here and who do we got the one point on one Billy pair anthem read but I didn't show another slide a data we actually orders fix the data point we have a chip sick data we have a favorite by epigenetic mark so all this data we were going to you know integrate to address some pretty common the regulation how to call it so this is a little bit of analysis and so this is still like say the working program and this is you know typical path approach you know to D dimension correlations and if you you know uses kind of observer expected but I knew that nature and this is typical compartment in this case we use the typical booster it finds paper the user called compartment basically compartment eighty far as the more activity you know which is Community Supported more open and accompany the moly past that both the mall and dance so this is where you know fully operative Puritan correlation and also then further user copies the one value to construct a compa metric this is the common one example clearly see these five important different form so if you look at the whole genome you really don't seem too much difference they all kind of same color and but if you look at a Zuni I should have put this like before that so thing if you look at it just the one to one region a particular como to one you see this is six point right from 124 clearly in this the next size the lately the pieces come Parma a a mother starting in 24 hours that disappeared but to do Thomas resistant late night in here you know so for this case really you know interesting cancer we can identify this counter pattern like cover my post-ops now working on the harmony I chose a sander for a to be a to be or a busy kind of a pattern there is a kind of a status to the family then we look at this you know if you typically look at the compartment on top and the utility again you really didn't see too much different I each increment oh you can a very similar number for compartment structure that's you know really not surprising you know regardless remover life we have another data we didn't show here you know regardless the common structure people already had or it's very stable but be three different as they are give a different about your condition they maybe move along but the whole structure is still there so we need to let you know in the field either more data to support this kind of conclusion or information so if you also look at it this really interesting graph so we simply choose graph the number on time point the only time one one hour you'll see the component a B is the converge so the number of compartments are saying so this is there something there we don't know yet um you know by all the point you know can spy out the point because if you need the many paper many studying clear hour one hour one your estrogen treated in either one hour the transcription level is the highest chain which means the most key you know expression can be the binding change everything including your body like we have data we not there yet but that definitely has something to you now and our Beth but after you know long term you know something you know stabilized so we really need that time series data to address how to estrogen you know a fact Martin resistance concept okay so what is this podcast beeping and so summarize this part and the basically innovative above is the competition or two and different field and usually in commercially to look at hi-c data and we knew that different static age to demonstrate the nation and our colon the data to try to address more cancer Pollock houses so I still have maybe a minute and talk about the last part or so many leeches the you know the very big particle in the lab and the visitor culture Panthro and if you guys notice just when we have a little bit of improve then we want lab and they use the cocktail and streams to Pacifica so we call a chip intent and so we already published the field paper on biology affect your more aggressive how do they are absolutely after use the chip answer to exam the Constitution disease cancer and we wanted also my personal to already lab he actually look at a different angle use these two and they're basically a little bitter you know this will go to of course our if you do the chip seek most of Stafford thing okay and from acacia a one step to improve the after one call lambda exhausted Exxon nuclear reactor bastard enzyme the function purpose is that can heat a DNA and cue the end of the binding order that's a very beautiful as when you can typical chip seek and you can identify speaking of 305 but this one you actually learn can identify one then further we use the space space to take a sequencing Kotoko not only you know look at also look at the sequencing to adapter you know those the three arma ended Fight Club because this the information very useful original protocol they didn't really leave the 2 adapter I will really do but this turns out this will this improvement really you know provide a much much more information from our fat fat and the algorithm already population path basically you know we have a sports tab very quickly you know first Ave to stop a very typical like educate or the P region and this utilized costly Parma fornication and typically if you forget a chip as it is used to reform and read it's just being is that if you use the 5 prime X or late on one then you can use the 25 of order so basically you know you have a person you have a bigger region like a gypsy can use a farm and you can tell it by actually the pickup order right then you know where they're so use these that we the color to our folks of one to start okay so first of the folks at one and the window folks the one is a 14-1 and color 2 is the pioneer Packer and pre very important load you know record a new column also consequently record cancer biology tentacle question and there so but we know folks are already well known prime factor I gotta chew it with you and clear paper there so that's why right now in the lab but we want to further address got a to so if you look at this one first in capital after cancer we see the four different we use our program we can Step five or different of happens the one typical usually we found a cocktail and of order which means that um to powder is appeared by if you look at ya if you look at her here you actually see the border to one year one year here but a North older border is appeared so so yeah so we identify you know pair now paired and a much prepared so but if you look at the pair the very interesting he is truly like a bimodal I so there's a 1 Peter along a another picker 1122 so fiscal typical you know looks like a little different I mean pattern looks like you know by model or someone there no time my ization to finding Hughes claim it's an interested in going out there and we'll put a look at the you know user artistic information to put them distinctly the part of model the author's clearly show the model bonnie is a fact that the motive I so this is the distant other motive pant who's the distance luckily you know for folks who want a tie stop almost 99% although we identify there's a force of a multi-tier so clearly folks the one if you director binding on the mode DNA and not the influence some you know change in factor can either work Kaziranga factor but these folks want clearly just sit down to DNA that's the house I'm a factor so then we you know calculator you control because this clearly family factor is related to new code or so we use the public data at the forum now we have a whole data the public data and you will particularly look at the folks of one powder a border and a three different a chromosome Lucas oh my we made a comment already and so if you calculator the neutral zone distance if you look at the four different the pattern nearly you know they are different one two three four the nuclear some distant is the different this is because they he used a certain linear recreation to calculate distance but of course we acknowledge at that time that data public data itself enough indeed we only now that you know why they look at that we try to do this more I will talk a little like so again they're further wing you know because there are also wines a factor can record a live model so then we further pick up a eight the modern factor either change gypsy so ideally we wanted you you know look at see how this with eight a different commenting model yukizona modeling how can different than we correlated or pattern unfortunately for this particular data we didn't seem too much different I also we found or engaged before eight the modern factor or have any indigenous although identify but that's not our purpose we want to see how four different I'm fighting model and the corridor soutane and modeler but we didn't find it but we also question of the catalyst that we have some data damage tree although at least the correct so this is the histone mark also really so we needed to do more work try to understand Richard is don't go mental model should regulate you compete about the one or call it a regular but one God maybe this will add a comment in the model we didn't like eighty different model again so then so further like I said that you know working robust we of course we have data we have paper we want to continue both on this topic so now we have a new data on data - and a unique Appa both chittering chittering but we want how to treat it aren't you the first so we have a chip and copay on the data so they know how to engage them each one we had a comp you can really fight if you want so you know Japan so definitely to this country not just a simple chip secretive so then we look at compared to portal 1 indeed though we also found a cutter for a color - is with our four different uh binding model in fact a sale at the the one but if you look at the power model the number that is the deeper the gap is deposited both the one both and Cheeta Cheeta days eleven twelve that I present but the cockatoo is different these this is not a tea base is the one planning one page bye so doesn't different so we can say we don't have enough data yes you work out that so folks want definite is the pena factor but the cutter truth may not be that clearly I'm a factor function I made it between like how I cannot okay also on include the color too so also we found actually need to see that yeah out of this flight so each other besides got a two we also found that folks the one that Baker motive move here I so this is the clearly show you know so maybe there's us here we found a besides gotta chew also folks at one beer but me folks a while you didn't see the color too right so there's clearly different so we need a adjust is more so now we we already talked about this life so now we are working on call meeting chip big you know if you guys also do Jersey so this is a different a little bit of for typical should take to be secretive corner and most commonly linked life before the common the link we also linen to take data but we we do the poster juice on to the mono nuclear Tom no minions cheetah then to that chip see we have a lot of data already already almost finished ideally we this already time we have almost 1 billion one hundred and million killing three duplicate and all these state are almost ability year and all through logic is to do we are planning to billing for all these examples so far today so the idea is we try to you to look at so this look at how the neutral zone and if actor cutter to or folks the one to call it a new Kagome I can say that when we did that the competition approach you look at the nucleosome at the fourth one the data not in beach now we have enough data sequence we almost I can identify for milling do consult so if you can yeah if your total Lucas on your attacker hold you know people really so we can identify all meetings so we could show these it is speculative because it besides a 15 it is just a theoretical number you really don't know how many there so with this data with the chip of the data we deafening and infer some very interesting power to be different the pioneer factor model I want you know I mean on the nuclear talk and we also have a h1 chips if data try to feed with h1 so also we look at a new Christian positioning we found that there the 178 so if you into the new composition in grouper you know this number is very good I already disorder average it application the one to 72 later for one nucleon instant because there's a depends lambda and this variation depends in the promoter region or the enhancer region and dance reading or open chromium really really this number all in line with so now we have a traveling more little dome how they dispute this rapidly Potter working on you know each other and so finally the model you know like a theater for all these we try to compose the model because the nucleosome is dynamically to locate it like that change because of the h1 to collect a DNA gene and send again out so that cuz with that if Fox a Wanda pioneer factor property because looking for the DNA motif but if ultimately for a muscle condensed and make sure to locate it once a founded the motive we can be lulululu reorganized because of make it out open is of course I mean that's why we wanted to remodel and I look at and finding there and it could all different compact how me and eventually you know make it a commanding recognition that's our model we want the data to test the model a lot of data so pork enclosure and Elizabeth the conclusion of course Laguna we have basic obama with cheaper pair and achieve answer data and try to examine onion factor how they'll a greater nuclear zone and resulting transcription regulation at the because of downline our particular biology order data is an impact and we put the future we if we can to find new conclusion you know this is the lab we put in the work and thinking with japan now working come on you know a Yeti that a high C algorithm now he does la popa co-star in sample choose to go back China so and other people and collaborating multiple [Applause] find a chip seek to identify transcription factors could be challenging could be a some expertise you can share on how to make that work and the music in ithaca Newton Apple law I'm sorry using chip using chip seek to find to get transcription factors located to pull to pull out the transcription factors this chip is that the challenging or not no I think it should seek a protocol for change in fact already established million total community so you can to attack an acre issue yesterday oh really yeah mission out so my group are actually more beyond it is that you think we already do the monastic Mong Mong Nina's should see so yeah you know you guys we can talk about we don't have any so chairman wants lab Peggy pamphlet poster you know these teeny did if you can't have a technical issue you can talk about to us we don't have any from the technology from the Nazis or like it so the advantage of using micro communities is when you want to look for histone modifications yeah for transcription factors you need to fix that's like low teens too that's why triple AG so that's why this data only I had to face chipper eggs or already you have a border I say you can't close it our algorithm you can found a close but then if we use the typical just conventional chip seek you'll really miss that or that's why we used with exciting the first even more nor nucleotide yes there is a gypsy he's the most of histone data and you people really this actually is in 147 pays the resolution right because you already know that take a lot pickle it is neither stupid nor malukas of a simple thing you look at each anouk ozone if you have a you know folks a wire cutter this is the thing information to earth if you get a powerful because you really can't see indeed that is it record linkage on by is that then week of course we can need a more more experiment to demonstrate knock down whatever but they died stop you know already learning in lead and show some path another question and i have a biological question with the ellen can't work so i record like I realize that you were probably getting the data and your collaborators are I notice there doesn't seem to be much difference between the gotta to the vehicles versus the D hydroxy testosterone are you making sure that Ellen capsules are still responding to androgens because they are known to be notorious to go from androgen responsive to non-responsive with passage and that's actually why they're nice model or caustic cancer from going from androgen responsive to irresponsive yes so that's why typical you know because it again like say that - is not really really typical can take you know all the so years or corroboree but their lab acid for example Chippewas lab so they you know of course address my team or something so typically when we designed the experiment not just a minicab person you have a lean caribou ever be able to treat again then you look at a a pilot and the basal conditional covenant you didn't they are binding very minimal right but you do see some ships iike a appear another much but after treated at the ATT you'll see dramatically increase same as we yeah so then there of course they also compare resistant and because my we also have eSATA but again we not really adjust know without me explain if you're not seeing much difference is that and also you've noted that you pointed out in a slide that you have like two biological replicates of those experiments so that may also be but if you're going from a cell line so the point of the point of exploring exposing in and kappa two hydroxy testosterone there's to look at androgen responsiveness or angry geneva-like non-responsiveness but and so that's why I was asking are you looking at are they looking at in androgen responsive conditions or non responsive image is this right yeah we really talked of different about the point is this pathetic hate we not really want to address particularly we don't want to even say for application purpose we even don't want to address I mean can we want more address pioneer factor so in the entity of course we link kappa not necessarily a I of course AI so make it play we not necessarily a is important I mean you know this we typically if you look at the cheek area Polly is in the new community privileges greeting so it's really not much related to this because you want the power and biology that different stolen we do have a another paper showed the HTT treaty de I in a are OSes the attitude box of one we have an AR paper few years ago so we really see the sleep how artists structure you know beep report read it you have a you know color to also on a are finally added after treaty that you see another body part the other see really three layer of structure that paper we also show that knockdown kata to knock down folks they want so yeah I really you know I really don't do not care but my point is normally I mean because of the model you're using I think it's an important thing to check my point is more related to the data to data that you've put on your slides so the point from my understanding the point of using the gara to data is to show that there is a difference between vehicle versus DHT yeah okay which so they can let me just finish ok so then because I want to make sure and I'd like I apologize I didn't explain it properly ok so I'm a biologist systems biologist and I always good have worked ok then cap so that's I hate them I hate and and kept us they're always ready in the weekends never they're always ready in the weekends never on the week so you have to come in weekend but my point was that got a tool that you've shown they didn't seem to be much difference yeah vehicle versus deg okay so it's an overall right however so to me it's there's two things it's either the treatments not working and there's no difference or it's not a guitar to because there's four guys in that family and their binding site and here be related so that was just what I wanted like yeah no no definitely these on the pizza parlor because okay so this apparently stupid you're saying doesn't mean the same to you you know what so you know yeah so basically you know people treat either you have a 5-pound the object shitty the maybe you have a three solubility mean he like great hit by car to another tweet ology is not biology that's what we wanted look at it so but uh the interest in your cultural life get the agencies with the by the model is then they gather cheetah and cheated that's expected that you're right we want to find them more we don't know yet so but at least this date I should define the PPS model is it said that's exactly we try to get but the other point is a anybody the experiment now work that stuff and not Utica we have a duplicate connector and the body is established you can say people already too many anybody because you have a form encoder please Lou as long you have a replica Garibaldi its antibody commercial variable that's can thank you are still that don't recognize and we can I don't think at this point I appreciate you what it's not the case so anybody but the model the same inches that's why we need to take out [Applause]
