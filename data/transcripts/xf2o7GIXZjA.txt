some more of the fall semester so I'm gonna do this little introduction I'm Marcy Brandenburg I'm the bank for mation nest with the top mineral sciences library DCM be in the bioinformatics core and I do the programming for the seminar series so if any time you're getting questions or you want to present I would be the person to contact so there are some new faces so if you've not been here before this is a weekly seminar series we basically as a different focus a lot of other seminars based on sneem we focus on tools and technology and methodology really sometimes they you know are just tools or technologies that are being used in a way that may be of interest sometimes there are new tools and technologies other times they're actually still in development and that's probably fine maybe you just please do sign in it just justifies the pizza and we want to continue offering that so with that I'm going to use our speaker Michael Brooks who is a postdoc and hematology oncology and that's which is that so yeah is that is the microphone sound good so as far as you said my name is Michael Brooks I'm in the the wish allowed I do a lot of breast cancer sequencing my background is in both wet lab and dry lab stuff I did my PhD at Wash U and the first half of my PhD was very computational doing sequencing technology stuff almost as it came out after Barbara wolves like RNA see paper and I was actually working on methods of you know improving the quantification of singles or of at that point and then later moved into the throat cancer and then here to University of Michigan to join Max's lab and do a lot of cancer so today will be pretty biologically focused because that's how I tend to do a lot of stuff is on the biology side but any computational questions that a few minutes so as I mentioned hi well today we're going to look at breast cancer stem cells and using drop seek to look at the heterogeneity in this population so what are cancer stem cells so basically in 1996 Dominic basically showed and was later shown in solid tumors that there were a small population of tumor cells that had increased tumor Genesee relative to the rest of the population they were also shown to have unlimited self renewal and they could recapitulate the original heterogeneity of the tumor when you took them off so you know we called them cancer stem cells the nice is that maybe they are what are really driving tumor growth and being able to target those cells in a limit they eliminate them might go a long way in being able to treat cancer so in a conditional therapy model which is designed to treat the fastest cycling cells of a particular tumor most of those type of modules modalities are not designed to target cancer stem cells and the cancer stem cells remain behind and are thought to really drive tumor relapse so the idea is that if you can find specific therapies to eliminate those particularly in combination with this model and itself would be a little outdated then if you targeted just the cancer stem cells it still wouldn't be quite enough but being able to target both the regular T cells and the tumor stem cells would go a long way cancer now in the wish' lab we were Max and later in collaboration with other people found these cancer stem cell markers in follow tumors the first set of markers that was used was cd4 T 4 plus 24 minus and later we also used aldh2 not only mention that because we'll talk about that later or some of my data now lately this idea of you know cancer stem cells is a little bit of a controversial field in cancer it comes down to somewhat semantics whether you believe they're truly stem cells or whether there's just a population of cells that are more energetic than the others but recently a lot of work has kind of backed this up and this was a really nice paper that probably most everyone here is familiar with they came out just a little while ago where they look through the tch tch jana and basically showed that there was a very strong stimulus signature that was associated with d differentiation and this ability to and so kind of backed up that you know the cancer stem cell offices even on large datasets and so this fits well with part of our hypothesis in the wish' lab trying to look at kind of this normal hierarchy and what are we trying to really see with cancer stem cells so one of our ideas is that you know a Brett this is the Waddington landscape for anyone that's not familiar with it in it it's a very old figure and it basically was this idea that as cells developed in developmental time they start to flow down basically the path of least resistance but there's blocks between going either back up the dough or across divides and so that's how cells going from a stem cell to a progenitor cell differentiate itself they kind of follow these various paths and why you know once you're in a final kind of normal human developmental stage you have a lot of these very specialized cell types and that's how you get there so basically as you go back up the hill you've increased stemness increased plasticity and ability to go down these different channels and so if you take any particular tissue you know for example breast it can differentiate down a couple different but the important part is and what we think is happening is that oncogenic transformation increases the stiffness of the particular cell that gets the academic event and leads to somewhere in the middle of a breast cancer stem cell and we know that they don't go fully back to complete pluripotency because breast tumors look different than colon tumors look different than brain tumors etc and there are a very rare type of tumors they kind of do everything called teratomas that are more from all the way up to it and we got a sense of this is important so we we can what we're trying to hope to eventually be able to see is signatures of this increased stemness find the properties of these cells look at how heterogeneous they are are they able to transform didn't down these different pathways that lead to tumor cells and all sorts of other cells that facilitate tumor growth and metastasis and be able to then know the difference between this cell versus the rest of your normal breasts themselves or other colon cells and so particularly in the wish' lab when i joined the lab i was really interested in this heterogeneity and this was actually you know in 2014 so certainly single-cell sequencing was around the dropps he can come out and this idea of being able to do really high throughput single-cell sequencing wasn't wasn't around but i was still really interested in heterogeneity and understanding the whole gamut of cells that are present in the tumor now in tumors there's two different types of heterogeneity for the most part there's genetic heterogeneity so essentially every tumor develops genetic mutations over its life and those kind of spilled and compound on each other and at least in the wish' lab we do not focus on this too much what we're really interested in is epigenetic resume so even given the same set of genetic mutations we know those cells can interconvert between different stem cell types and produce different types of medical and epithelial cells so given an any given tumor you might have you know a couple different types of stem cells and these various themselves again as I mentioned on the epithet or the mesenchymal side here were marked by cd4 T 4 plus C 24 minus on the more epithelial side marked by being hailed h plus and we know that these can interconvert enough is probably mediated by the tumor micro-environment but each of these students of themselves can probably differentiate out the mesenchymal and epithelial intersections so again any given tumor might have all of the assumer cell types or maybe a very specific subset of them and so what we're really interested in is using that information to be able to eventually characterize any particular tumor as a subset of these various cells and so we think in a very broad sense there's all these different molecular subtypes of breast cancer so you have I mean most people have probably heard of like triple negative breast cancer so that encompasses both these top two but there's an even kind of subdivided part of triple negatives called the quad and lows that are very aggressive in highly mesenchymal basal is kind of the more common triple negative it's still mostly epithelial cells with a high percentage and this goes all the way down to like a luminal a tumor that would be almost entirely folk at the fuel cells and so our goal is to eventually be able to take a tumor and essentially kind of look and prove this hypothesis look at the various different populations that are present in any given tumor to be able to kind of bend them into their various cell types and also look at a bunch of different tumors and understand that and the last part of this kind of hypothesis is what we suspect is that a medic on oil cancer stem cell from one tumor might be very similar to a medicine Camelot stem cell from a different there they might be in different proportions some tumors might not have them but we think that they would use the same pathways to drive their their function in the tumor and we hope to then be able to use that to kind of look at targeted therapies or various different tumor types and come up with stuff that might be able to target as many tumor types as possible absolutely is there any reason us to have like no I mean we think that probably there aren't you know an infinite number of cell types and any of these but absolutely like if it the very least the bins are so overlapping that they they would probably if that a rough estimate look pretty continuous but if you sample enough you probably start seeing bins because we you know at least in normal biology there's very defined bins cells go there's a very short transition period and they go to a different cell type and they go to a different cell type and we think that in general cancer kind of certainly will kind of make those boundaries muddier but they probably don't completely disappear and self have different cell types even in tumors that we think of this time in that sense very poisonous so we also know that a lot of these cells you know are not sitting in isolation there's feedback loops between the various cell types that come you know contribute to these different models and while I won't talk about it a lot today that the second half of my project is both describing what the cell types are present and looking at the population dynamic so understanding how the cells change over time so you know just to understand what kind of what our ultimate goal is is understanding that when you you could draw a network between all of these of course and kind of use you know Markov chains and to understand all these different things the wall of course some of these would be zeros what we're really interested in is for any given cell population defining all the transition probabilities and all the genes for this population but essentially now we know of course we knew this before but now we can actually look at these instead of as like single numbers using single cells to get populations for all these and really understand what is happening in each of these nodes and what would happen when you eliminate one of these populations is that is going back you know we know that even for example when you might eliminate all of the non cancer stem cells with a conventional therapy the cancer stem cells will recapitulate the rest of the tumor and if you even remove the cancer stem cells you can get D differentiation and those cells can come back and make cancer stem cells so you have to really get a full picture of the entire thing to be able to know what might be the key Lynch in tumor type that you could remove to have to be most effective so I certainly won't go too much into the background of drop seek but there might be a few people here that aren't familiar with the technique so you know this was a ASCO from Steve Carrell lab and 2015 kind of came out with this idea that being able to in a high-throughput way with a microbe for the surprise pair of cells and feeds you would be able to do high kupo sequencing in a very rapid manner and the idea is that these beads poly nucleotides on them that can capture the mRNA and you can process everything in a hyper manner so again the flow device kind of looks like this in the lab we can make these so we used ones that are not commercially prepared that we make ourselves here is you know a model of the flow showing a bead coming along here and the cell coming you know right there here and of course this is how you slow it down but this happens you know a second and again for the people that aren't familiar with this technique really that the beads are the key to the process so what they ended up doing basically doing this cooled synthesis method where they can take feeds they pool them split them into a G C and T synthesis round pull them back together and repeat this twelve times and that's how you can basically get the same sequence on all the beach for the PCR handle but then switch to having a very specific cell barcode where every all ago on the bead has been saying the same exact sequence and then use again random sequencing for synthesis with you mines and the points so you can then take this information and want your sequence that you learn every given mRNA you get your cell barcode that you map it back to the cell and the Umi or PCR correction insight now again once you get this information you and you can recover this information by your two reads so you do pair it in sequencing but the first read basically just gives you your cell barcode in your um i and ii read gives you your gene identity and lets you actually so finally we get to like what am i actually going to do with drop seek so anecdotally i actually you know wasn't really sold on single cell sequencing kind of at first when it when it first came out because again I'm pretty old-school so I was around back when we were first doing RNA seek you know and we're talking like 50 million reads per sample and stuff like that and then drops each single cell papers come out and you're like oh you're getting 50,000 reads per so like you know but luckily my old P I come convinced me during one meeting with them that drop seek was the way to go and so we've been doing this for you know about a year and a half now dropsy and so the first thing that we really wanted to do was just look in a kind of unbiased way let's take a bunch of breast cancer cell lines let's do drop seek on them and see what we can pull out so we took a variety of different breast cancer lines and if you remember there's all these different molecular subtypes of breast cancer so we spread our science out across facial pablo the pursuit and luminal lines and we did that data so i'm gonna ship most of the amounts that i will show you it is from sera i'm sure that everyone is pretty familiar with the ages pretty much right now they kind of the default drop seek analysis pipeline i played around with a lot of other ones but i tend to stick with it so our overall analysis pipeline I use the macaco Java programs for all the read alignment U star all their cleanup steps everything is very Sanders there and then I pulled into sera through the standard some more standard quality control filtering and overall you know we do the principal component analysis t-sne for you know reduction in the dimensionality then I crossed ourselves with the traditional sera cluster and movie expression differences so when we first did all ten cell lines and did the TST clustering what we really hope to find so our main goal going back to what I described previously is that we expect across the different molecular subtypes to have kind of commonalities between these stem cells so different stem cell populations might be similar or across the different cell lines so what we're really hoping for I mean I don't think we realistically expected this pop out but in a best-case scenario you'd be able to take the stem like cells that we know are present in all these different cell lines and see all of those grouping together and maybe have a couple of their separate populations of these non cancer stem cells and basically recapitulate that one figure where you had across different molecular subtypes different cell populations but of course they basically what we really got was and I'll show this in more detail but each of the cell lines sits very independently and either by almost in any clustering method you use sera tells you that they are all very distinct and doesn't really mix up the different cell types and so before I get into that data you know we I'm not going to show you the data today but we've actually been working with Jimmy and Simon and other people from the midis group in looking at further and better ways of analyzing this type of data but that's still work in progress right now the idea would be to try to pull out more subtle differences based on transcription factor numbers date of those look like cell cycles state I will show you a nice graph that shows you that yes but you know very sulfide goes obviously that pretty much the first principle component that pops out and it's one of the only ones but but neither of these kind of completely split into like a cell that if your question was one of these groups self cycling and the other non no no it wasn't okay but yet like g1s yet in each cluster it very well-defined like cycling versus non fine so we first started looking at our cell cycle markers and so for our students on markers and so again we had a old eh expression and there's two different like isoforms that ALDH that really drive things and that's LD a 21 and ALDH 23 but that I mean this is a good example of why we know that these cell lines didn't really like pull all the students together because for the most part only one of our cell lines some one five nine has very strong expression of Ald a21 and so it's it's here off to the side when we for example looked at Ald age 23 we saw that you know our two cell lines that were reasonably strong and expression say here with again a spattering of other cells that are LD a 23 in the rest the population if you remember cd44 was another one of the markers and has reasonable expression across and finally one of the other both a molecular subtype marker and a stem cell marker is her2 and so we saw that very strongly expressed in the two her2 positive cell lines and we it is interesting that you saw a good amount of her to expression in most of the other so on and again this is an interesting it's anecdotal but basically it matches was something that max and other clinicians had found was that her two lines have went from being one of the most poor prognosis to one of the best prognosis because we developed a lot of targeted therapies to her to but it turns out that if you are misdiagnosed as her2 positive given her to treatment but then turned out that you you weren't really probably like a full her to amplify tumor do you do much better and so basically that it's probably been found that all of these cells and all the tumors are probably an important stem cell marker and so treating almost any patient with Herceptin and actually have positive benefit which makes sense they given C that we given that we see her positive yes so this yeah that really agrees for the most part cd44 works matches up with what you would think and that like the really the more mesenchymal basal triple negatives have higher expression of cd44 and the three the luminal ones here have lower expressiveness and the inverse is true for her CT 24 you really want to find ourselves in the middle of stem cells yeah find the system yeah so that's basically where I'm gonna get to is that we we realized that yet even with this broad data we really weren't focus we couldn't focus in on those so eventually what we do is we just we don't have a cell line that has like pure positive population we just started we did drop C on sorted population so we sorted out the Ald H+ themselves and dewdrops eat specifically on those and so and this is another reinforcement they kind of you know yeah everything makes sense in this data in a broad sense are epithelial lines have high F ham and ESR are mesenchymal lines have very high vimentin but as you can see the reason i'm showing you a lot of these findings is basically what you mentioned is that the reason that we obviously don't get all of our stem cells together is there's just so many genes that are just wildly different between the two so on so even stem cells and all these different populations are still the teeny is going to be driven by vimentin and F can be strikingly different between all of this online and that that's what's really driving it and then so I'm showing you all the genes that kinda stemness teams that are markers for it's definite it's basically I think this is based on the top like 500 most variable genes but not specific to stim this or anything other that we knew a priori from breast cancer something I mean you're catching the wrong end of the Train even those markers if you have zoomed those cell lines they're all having some sort of features in common they those genes principally the Model T for much what they want to be different from the one selling to another so maybe one said uh I don't know the ones don't marry too much do they show up as clinically known stem stem cell markers yeah so we that's a good point I mean so we think that yet it's a hard problem right so not only do we do think that all the stem cells might have the same signature but they're all such a very small percentage of you know any given tumor like only five percent of these cells would be stem cell markers so we haven't we haven't done you know what you're suggesting so I understand you from this plot is that you're actually catching the genes that are characteristic of different cell lines yeah they're different between cell lines so they you they end up in yeah yeah so and that's one with the way but how do you decide like you know which of the I guess you could just keep eliminating all the most variable genes and kind of only do your teach me on you know genes that are more uncommon what our hypothesis was and what we worked with Jun and another computational postdoc and some other things sohara was to still look at all of the genes but look at the transcription factor pathways and those might be more kind of in that realm where there wouldn't be so drastically different across this so on that maybe we'd be able to see that great so that's a good idea look at the functions that are robust enough among themselves maybe it's something like a Norge yeah yeah until we make for example if you if you pull out notch or things like that there one there really lowly expressed for the most part but yeah you'll see like a handful of selves in each group but yeah I guess what we really need to do is kind of isolate those and then you maybe the cost just okay so this is gonna sound like a very unpopular opinion but I had my experience with unsupervised methods and frankly I feel like you're kind of like a Rorschach test where you just keep trying until you get something that looks good and yeah how do you really judge what are one method is better like what are you use all the genes and how high maternal expressed gain how long are differentially expect things like or the most variable genes like there's one really any better in the end I feel like all you're trying to do it in get a pretty picture yeah no I I I would be pretty much a match yeah I need a lot of this drop seek analysis in general kind of fits that mold where like there isn't a consensus way of doing all these analyses so you can't have this bad tendency to like just keep doing the analyses until you get the answer you want and particularly for clustering I think that's one reason but we haven't played around too much look like which genes would think we just kind of use the the top most genes and we know that this you know made sense in this way but if we probably could have played around with it but the ideas yeah so basically can't really say for sure which method is better better I mean I think this use the truth I believe in this this result in that I know that these cell lines are so different from each other then I'm not surprised at all that they you know they say like when we do with this plot besides just looking at a picture and saying oh begin separate all 10 cell lines from each other yeah we already knew ahead of time that they're not same cell line yeah no I mean and we did it with the hope that maybe it wouldn't be this but like it as you mentioned I think the follow experiments is what we did was take individual cell lines and do directed sequencing on you know our stem like populations to look more specifically at those yeah yeah and this that I was also thinking like you maybe you can use this pod to find well you already have an idea of a few marker games at priority right I mean you could probably do some sort of I don't know independent component analysis something like that buying even more hardcore games that haven't really we'll even noted in a literature I mean you're already doing excusing our clustering based on every single gene on dice backing maybe there's some other marketing that people haven't really don't yet before you because the bigger lies that physical firm yeah and I will get to that once I do the ALDH sequencing that that's one of our goals so and then just kind of skip over these because again most of this is just the same thing but I did want to show you know back to your question that of you will see that in general for any given gene that I showed up here the population of that cell line is basically yes or no most of the time and very homogeneous across the cell line for that there are some exact in beads of 20 here but for the most part that's our but the cell cycle was of course you know probably the biggest differentiator where we know that in principle component 1 and driving a lot of this clustering that whether it's so was cycling or not which way to find that but that's not surprising it and these days we you know regress the most of that out and most of the data I will show you from now on actually is regressed out but I did have this original picture where we weren't regressing out yeah yeah that would be really interesting so I haven't used that machine learning paper as much as I should to basically take their block of genes and Coster on it and you know you know figure out whether that's affecting those populations I think we're thinking about doing that you know so to get around this issue so I think everyone is basically you know in agreement with with what we said from this data is we didn't find all these very specific stimuli populations in an unbiased fashion across all those different cell lines and so what we wanted to do with then go more specifically and dewdrop see just on the cancer stem cell populations now the main downside to this is that now we're relying that markers that we know about which is basically cd44 plus the combination of cd4 T 4 plus and 24 minus or ALDH that those are correct and we know they work but they might not mean the only marker they might not be the best marker but now we've kind of biased ourselves based on that information so I did it from two populations so the first one that I want to just mention was someone for nine so it's one of the cell lines that I just showed but we use a reporter system to mark the cancer stem cells now it's still basically the same markers we used ALDH 183 driving and in Cherry and then because it's a reporter system and it's really tricky to do like cd44 plus 24 minus in a reporter system you have to have more reporters and we are working on that but we used a general mesenchymal reporter from the mitten driving GFP and so from these cells we would basically have four populations so we've have the the double positive cells so those should be the cancer stem cells that kind of have dual properties so they sit in the middle they have ALDH and they're a little bit mesenchymal the double negative we would hope we wouldn't really know exactly what populations those were so we would in general expect to kind of just ignore the double negatives then we would have our really mesenchymal cells on one end and are really epithelial cells on the other and so we would be looking for a lot of sin like properties in our double postures then finally we also took the very oh six eight cell line and we just sorted for ALDH and cd44 plus 24 minus though in the end this population was so small it was like point zero zero one percent it was probably basic background and that's another caveat to this is that not all cell lines will have all the different markers so I will only talk about that aah positive because essentially it seems like cd44 plus 24 minus isn't a good marker combination and then we use book as a control which basically is the absence of either of the markers so when we took this some 149 years order after all of our drop seek and in general we were going for about a thousand cells of each and there's about 600 or 700 cells of each after filtering now this looks like a big jumble in some what we weren't super surprised again you know this has again just a cell line that we have sorted but in general all the cell's still come from that same cell line but what I will show you here is and so the dots are a little clearer on my screen but basically the GFP owning cells and the interior only cells really sit distinctly in their separate like quadrants of this giant TSV blog now the interesting part is and we still haven't figured this out and it's certainly a big caveat is that the double positive in the double negative kind of sit on top of each other we suspect and I'll show you some data that reinforces that the sorting worked and everything you know with the normal variability of single cell data work pretty well but we suspect that maybe the double negatives ended up as artifacts that have lost the report for some for some reason and so their technical negatives and they probably should have been in the other population we're still not 100% sure about that but so to verify that our sorting you know worked we can look at for example ALDH 183 and that was drug that our reporter órale 23 drives in cherry and so you can see that you definitely get the strongest signal from the in cherry as well as the double positive but you know in something that's not you know surprising but probably not appreciated as much that there is still a lot of you know purity issues when we when you just fax or something so there's plenty of ALDH 183 expression in the double negatives in the GOP only but there's a clear enrichment it's it's very statistically significant for the double positive in the internals if we look at em shirt or the vimentin we see again something pretty similar the GOP only and the double positive are pretty definitely GFP on may have a significant enrichment there seems to be a little bit of interior only vimentin signal but compared to the so we are pretty confident that you know we are getting some information from the reporter inking separate out these populations yeah I think that helps too we did notice that I mean obviously it means that like they're still like you know there must be an extraordinary number of zeros here and some high so it's basically bimodal compared to a little bit less of a bimodal distribution here and that might back that the double negative is truly like you treat some true double negatives and some like contamination from what should have been an injury positives are because yeah it looks like it should be pulling the violin plot pretty high right but there must just be so many like all negatives or would be was ours so if you take these cells now and ask sera to do some unbiased clustering you end up this is just a small outlier population of dead cells that that we would normally regret like pull out and but you can see that you get basically you know five through or six real clusters and so we looked at cross those clusters to look at the the population the percentage of the south and so this also facts that again the particularly the GFP only and the in cherry only populations are very significantly different but while the double negative and the double positives still are sitting kind of on top of each other and so look at this graph so this is cluster zero cluster one all the way up to cluster seven and this is in the numerical form so this essentially is the same data from here just I guess the flipped upside down so the in cherry only as a as the highest enrichment for the cluster zero which have also the highest enrichment for the ALDH one eight three expressions so this is basically the ALDH when a three cluster and you can see the other subtypes there sorry so there's six clusters you find them unsupervised clustering by the way yes exactly so you can you can basically you know pass of those populations because again we oh you do you pull them together yes commands like one did I said in another drinks yep yeah so all this data was the combined data sets put together i've analyzed them independently as well there's kind of most interesting to again put them all back together and asked it you know can you pull out those stimuli populations when they're all so we were interested in as I mentioned that we think that cluster zero is the injury only slash' LDH cluster and ALDH does come up in that cluster so we did some gene set enrichment analysis and we do get a lot of the stuff that we would expect stem line targets early up a gastric cancer early up but nothing that like really stood out you know we still don't get a lot of socks to corn and all you know some very Laurie potent stem like genes that we know are important in cancer stem cells so I wanted to so again we have this data and we looked at the the Vario of six eight sorted ALDH cancer what kind of expression level do those feet which the ones you wanted to see them yeah I mean very rare you know so aren't you in the territory where like this single drop sequencing you're gonna be just asking as far as things are not yeah so that's why we tend to you know still do you know high populations of cells like a thousand cells and what we've been looking for it is pushing that further but I think you know there's the work that we've been doing is again with Julie and is the idea that those stem cell turns Krypton factor socks you out for an and on for example very lowly expressed but their pathways downstream lead to genes that are higher expressed so we've been trying to look for the downstream targets and more network analysis and things like that but that's still kind of ongoing do they have for you another estimates of the efficiency of recovery transcripts so basically they say you know the quoted in the paper in it seems reasonable based you know on some back the envelope math it's about 10 percent of the mRNA of an any given cell it is capturable so yeah you know there's a stuff that's president only transcripts yourself yeah are you unless they're only part of the time yeah so that you know the nice thing is though that at least there's no evidence against this that that ten percent that's captured should be across whether you're the highest express gene or the lowest express gene your chance should be approximately equal to get captured and so if you can look at enough cells you can still hopefully you know still see your occasional socks to off or inanimate and and be able to discriminate those populations so that's what we've been hoping if you already builder pocket well or you know if they're truly in the LDH have only socks to our foreign am hobby so you can see that they still only come up but I completely agree that they're those particular genes are still very rare so nicely this the very oh six eight data would be even better than a recorder because we're just staining for this cancer stem cell marker it's a little bit more of a snapshot of time so when we still put them both together and clustered we see a significant shift in the two populations and when we plot the aldh either on the bat or the violin plot we can see a significant enrichment in that population and so when you ask the raw in an unbiased fashion to cluster those you get kind of two separate populations with a third that cluster number two is interesting but for the most part it's driven by this thin light signature between zero and one and again this is similar to before where you can see the ALDH expression and the cluster number one this is zero one is the one that's specific to their very osek say ALDH so when we pulled out those genes and did gene expression analysis we do get LDH 183 and a lot of other interesting genes so this this does make a lot of sense and gives our best a that and back you know to the question before this is where we're hoping to find like the new markers of LDH and stem like cells is any of these genes you know and so we're looking at finding which of these genes might be extracellular and being able to sort on them and see if those also are markers of interest and results in residents so one of our but this those questions were mostly looking at Ald age itself compared to the bull so we what also wanted to kind of dig down into the LTH only LDH those themselves because for the most part you could argue that I could have done almost all this you know in a poke sequencing method if we're just going to sort out ALDH positive versus old and so when you take just the ALDH positive cells themselves from the the Vario 6:8 and cluster them you end up with giving some unique populations and we're still in the process of through these but one of them you know certainly looks pretty interesting though it might be the cell cycling it's obviously there are certainly some cell proliferation sup here but it's probably mixed in with some interesting biology because not all these are so cycling and this data was regressed on cell cycle analysis so it's still bleeding through a little bit there's probably some so again we'll use these markers to kind of see whether a old age itself can be further refined by different markers so our future directions so you know continuing some of these advanced transcription factor analysis with JUnit and other collaborators I think will be really key because again we keep finding for the most part in a lot of these analyses stuff we already knew we're confirming that LDH is there and that the the combo versus epithelial spectrum is so there but we're really not pulling out the biology behind the cancer stem cells and understanding how those are functions so that's one of the things that were interested you know I'm sure everyone's really well aware you know I focused on sera here I continued myself try all these new data analysis pipelines and packages that come out you know I think that you know kind of back to your comment that even even across different pipelines I usually redo the analyses and you know they usually look basically the same but you never know if they look different like which of those was the right way and you just keep going until you get one that gives you the result that you like you know I'm wary of you know that that kind of bias that can be introduced by just trying a bunch of different stuff so we're gonna validate the sorted cancer stem cell drop seek by using those gene lists to hopefully find some some new cancer stem cell markers and being able to test them in vivo and mice and understand whether hopefully we are getting some new biology and then we're also working with in collaboration with antique garage across need to do some single-cell hi-c maybe the there was a new paper that came out looking at from you go the guy can't remember right now and I should but yeah should dairies love doing the RNA seek and a taxi on the same cells so maybe we can do that from interests and do that so with that I'd like to think you know my mentor max we have a lot of great collaborators and people in the lab and I have grants support from the ecrf and postdoc fellowship from you guys Louie and so with that I would take any other questions yeah so I definitely is so even from particularly from any two samples that are the same cells sorted by different times I I see drastically different levels in the mean thing that I see is kind of that background ribosomal and mitochondrial percentage that a lot of people use this kind of a metric for how healthy your cells are but I see pretty big differences and that's instead of genes but it seems to be able to be regressed out you know in in surah pretty well but there's definitely some some reasonable batch effects there to answer that question you can benchmark yeah yeah and so I've done that and so basically yes it would if you don't do very much regression and you plot them they'll be their own island but if you regress out the mitochondria and ribosomal and cell cycle they tend to basically still not a hundred percent so yeah basically there are hope that actually well so in that for the rapporteur system sort in the population yeah positive yes yeah and so at least so yeah so we we did that so basically we tried to look for so the problem is that we use one of our main markers ALDH as the sorting and it basically looks about the same as the MJ only right yeah so we haven't done that like wit so with some third or a second measure of stemness like using the machine learning like you know gene set has the scoring all of the kids that you have not chosen yeah yeah so we looked at like for example socks to knock for Nana and they're just too low Express and don't seem to be different and we looked at like cd44 plus looks about the same but otherwise yeah using like a less biased like that machine learning correlation mark Rocha positive yeah so again like with cancer like you know based on Max's paper we but it's still pretty relative yeah yeah we thought about that I mean and I think we're getting to that point where we're gonna have to I mean obviously that the downsides are that no matter what you do you might change you're gonna be affecting the stem cells in some way and you don't know how much you're really pushing them and how hard if there's like particularly you tried to throw it like there are induced cancer stem cell models that are the like Yamanaka factors put on though it can't background but I've never been super convinced that they're not like making some weird new crazy cell that doesn't represent true cancer stem cells but I think we're getting there generations are footin by myself yeah it's true our little world passage cultures um they're all relatively like in the wish' lab they're less than 30 passages from a TCC but of course that doesn't already met it I mean yeah if there's stem cells that aren't highly proliferating think you'd be diluting them out you'd be dependent on things I guess I transformed back to that state yeah we don't take long to do that no we basically know that of the so I take it back so nine of them are like super high passage like again you know well both those effects would become significant besides the Berrio 6/8 that are a low passage so long to be derived ourselves um but we do know that of all those cell lines they do have still cancer stem cells and that you can take the ALDH positive versus the LDH a negative put them in mice and get increased tumor Genesis so there's a they have to be so you have a key yeah there's a homeostatic balance between like the differentiation and maintenance of the cancer stem cells over a long period but in general I didn't show the data today but we do have in vivo PDX patient-derived xenograft data that is lower passage always thrown in mice but similarly we still have a hard time picking out the cancer stem cells in that data as well and so again it might go back to whether it's a threshold issue what do you have to do to derive the lion from later patient sample a little bit of trial and error but for the most part it's taking a chunk of the tumor great straight from the Loire and putting it in the mammary gland of a mouse and letting it grow and then you know maybe 50% of those grow 50% don't and the ones that do you just once that Mouse the tumor gets big enough you chop it up and put it into more mice and you basically just expand it forever in mice and never let it these lines are actually the tissue culture yeah these lines are together in the patient are cleaning what do you have to do with them you know because ever these selecting for kinda rare things and not looking at Oh typical cancer yes I mean absolutely so you'll notice that all these cell lines again aren't very homogeneous and it's because they basically have like you can take a chunk of tumor throw it in a dish and three cells will grow out of that out of the million that you threw in the dish and if you redid that a hundred times you get a hundred different cell lines but the only issue the only thing that makes it okay at least a little bit is that you know the someone five-nines that we use our somewhat similar to someone five nine different lab uses so at least what we call someone five- kind of standardized even if it in no way represents what that original tumor really was the first thing first is that you know for your data your signals okay now what is the average and what's in the normal is also greatly correlating real well with about:mozilla are a sick day about to start with yeah that will be the feeder number one yeah we haven't done the full bore with RNA seek on Lewis Owens but I think qrt-pcr yeah that's right yeah this will
