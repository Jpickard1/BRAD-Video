thanks thanks Ryan and um thanks thanks Brian that was uh off to a great start for a 10-year anniversary um I guess I just want to start with saying happy birthday to dcmb so we had a recent lab meeting not everyone was there but a lot of folks were so from top left to right from Keegan myself Maya Alice Loveland Peter Cassie arushi Krista Vlad Adelaide and Cynthia happy birthday I've started here in 2014 so I've been here for eight of those 10 years and it's been an absolutely phenomenal experience like Brian said the environment is top-notch from undergrads to graduate students to postdocs to staff to administrators and to my faculty College it's really really a privilege to be up here and share this platform with so many impressive individuals so happy birthday dcmb I want to talk a little bit about one of the projects that we're pushing on nowadays and here's the kind of outline of the brief talk that I'll give first first I'll start with some motivation about biological complexity across dimensions and the need to do data integration is absolutely critical to understand mechanisms across these dimensions and I'll talk about really the meat of the talk is population scale integrative single nucleus multi-ohmics to dissect g-watt signals and focus on t2d and related traits and skeletal muscle have some conclusions and then I'll defray or delay questions until the very end after everyone has had a chance to speak and we'll all have a seat up here so t2d is is quite a complex disease it's characterized by glucose dysregulation um and it's uh affects our manifests through multiple different organ systems the brain the liver the pancreas the eyelids and the pancreas skeletal muscle and adipose tissue uh to some extent we're involved in analysis of all these tissues today I'm going to focus on skeletal muscle tissue if you look at t2d from a different perspective from genomide Association study or G Watts perspective it's an incredibly complex disease right so currently the most recent high-powered g-was has over 600 statistically independent signals of genetic Association across your genome so your genome is literally littered with risk alleles scattered everywhere and if you look closer at these risk flow sign figure out where the Snips occur it's quite remarkable and that the vast majority of them are in the non-coding space right so that little bar plot the light gray is all the non-coding signals and the dark gray is the coating and it's less than 10 percent of these signals overlap a coding feature that means that really what's Happening Here is in purple is a regulatory element and the green triangles are t2d and synapse overlapping that distal regulatory element the loops and contacts some Target Gene and then modulates expression of that Target Gene so most of these variants that are associated with disease are not directly altering protein function but instead modulating when wearing ex and and how much genes are expressed thus these the causal mechanisms as any given Locus is incredibly difficult to dissect and I want to back up a little bit and say that t2d is not the only disease or trait for which gwas has been performed if you look at a recent release of the GEOS catalog there are over 72 000 documented genetic associations with some sort of disease or a quantitative trait and if you look at all of those associations throughout the GEOS catalog it's exactly the same picture as t2d so they're nearly all non-coding so whenever I talk about t2d or I'll talk about BMI or wasted hip Ratio or any kind of complex trait just recall that these are models for almost every complex trait in which nearly all Snips are non-coding and not affecting directly genes so the way that we think about this kind of hierarchy of how do genetic variations exert this complex trait effect on an organism they percolate through these layers of molecular hierarchy and I've arranged them here to show the epigenome the transcriptome the proteome all the other ohms that you can think of and this goes back to the integrative approach that Brian established when he founded found the department I'd like to emphasize that the bottom layer that the genome layer is invariant we're not talking about cancer somatic variation here we're talking about germline genetic variation where essentially every cell in your body has the exact same instruction booklet all the other ohm layers are very context specific right so is it in your muscle is it in your adiposes and your eyelids and your liver and your brain did you just eat a Big Mac or a banana those are the types of contacts that we're we're talking about um I like to put a gold star next to the epigenome because I think it is the most proximal molecular layer after genetic variation that propagates the effect of a genetic variant through these different ohmic layers into the organismal phenotype um so it's critical to look at the epigenome but also to integrate across genetic epigenome and transcriptome layers so how do we measure the epigenome one approach that we love and in our group is called the assay for transpose a successful chromatin or attack seek attack seek essentially Maps the open chromatin accessibility landscape so if you think back about how DNA is organized inside your nucleus it's wrapped around nucleosomes right here and then when a transcription Factor binds it focally creates open chromate 10 organization and you can measure the accessibility of Chromatin using enzymes like tn5 sequence the reads and after reads back to the genome and at the very bottom I'm showing you real true attack seek data where to the left and right of the plot there's basically no reads mapping indicating DNA that's occluded by nucleosomal architecture but in the middle is highly open and accessible DNA indicating regulatory element activity transcription Factor has likely landed there and created focal chroma open chromatin architecture what we're really interested in is not just any open chromatin region but an open chromatin region that's influenced by genetic variation for example right here again real Attack seek data where I'm plotting individuals by their genetic variation at this particular snip so individuals that are homozygous a have very high chromosome accessibility individuals that are heterozygous have medium chromat accessibility in individuals that are homozygous G you basically wouldn't call a p there at all it looks completely flat right so a very strong genetic effect on the regulatory landscape which we can quantify by doing this attack seek readout so this is what we want to get to when we want to do this at population scale not just using reference Maps because again if your reference map is based on an individual's homozygous G genotype you've totally missed the point here so focusing on skeletal muscle it's a a bulk complex tissue which requires a single nucleus or single cell approach to dissect all the heterogeneity embedded in that complex tissue and on the right are the types of cells that you would expect to see if you were to do single nucleus or single cell profiling skeletal muscle the slow and fast twitch muscle fibers are multi-nucleated so you'll expect to see lots of nuclei from those particular cell types and then you also expect to see mesenchymal stem cells and immune cells and cells that represent the vasculature like endothelial and smooth muscle cells satellite cells the precursors and nmjs or neuromuscular muscular Junction cells that help with communication between the skeletal muscle and the nervous system so I'll just um highlight that back at the end of 2021 we did work in collaboration with Chuck Brandt here and uh co-led by three co-first authors Peter Orchard and Indiana manakam and Christa ventresca where we did single nucleus multi-omic profiling across human and rat both RNA and both attack modalities this represents about 34 000 nuclei so I'm not going to talk any more about this other than say it exists and at the end of 2021 fast forward a few months the human uh tabula sapiens Atlas came out and made the cover of science they had skeletal muscle samples in there too it was RNA data not attack data and it represents about 30 000 different nuclei so a little bit lower than we had published a few months earlier but a very impressive paper uh showing in total a nearly half a million nuclei about 483 000 nuclei but across only a few individuals not a lot of individuals just like four or five or less than a dozen individuals um so what we've done and this is all in published work is um single single nucleus profiling across over 400 different uh samples and collectively this represents a little over half a million nuclei and we've profiled these in samples at three different levels at the genetic level so the genome at the single nucleus chromatin accessibility level attack seek and also at the single nucleus transcriptome level I'm going to fast forward through a lot of the the QC and details but generally show you what our aim is to identify nuclei that correspond to the different fiber types to the endothelial cells the satellite cells all the constituent cell types and then integrate those cell-specific transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiles with underlying genetic variation to identify on the top here genetic variants that are associated with chromatin accessibility or SCA qtl chromatic accessibility quantitrate Locus or genetic variants that are associated with gene expression or expression qtl eqtl uh and and this again will illuminate kind of how genetic variations influence the transcriptome and uh epigenome and if one of them might have a cause on the other the way that we did this experiment I thought was um was pretty fun because it's scary up front we took these over 400 individuals and we only used 10 batches and each batch had about 40 individuals mixed together in the batch so every of those 40 samples was processed in exactly the same manner and the way that we can get unstuck and assign a nucleus back to the individual that it belongs to is because all of these samples were previously genotyped so we just take the rna-seq reads or the attack secrets and we compare it to the known genetic variation of that individual and then we can assign an individual nucleus from one of the 40 samples to its corresponding donor pulverize mix everything up again everything very well controlled in these batches and we implemented a blocked a randomized block study designed to control for any kind of covariates of Interest we did lots of attack and RNA single nucleus sequencing and the Really the the value of this is it's super cost efficient because you can massively overload these flow cells when you're doing this type of multiplexing because you're not scared of doublets anymore you can genetically identify doublets and not be worried about them in your analysis that's Point number two you avoid batch effects right so all these you know people from different ages and different disease statuses and different sites across the country are all mixed in the same batch so it eliminates any kind of technical variations associated with processing samples individually it's incredibly fast we did all of this data generation in about one month so you would not be able to do that unless you had an army of personnel which we don't working on single samples around the clock and then finally I think it increases rigor and reproducibility of the work because again it very nicely controls for Technical and batch effects in the data of which there are many so I'm going to fast forward to the analysis that we got this is only looking at a subset 287 of the 400-ish samples you can see we get different fiber types type 1 type 2A type 2X and then a bunch of other are different cell types that we expect all at low abundance in the bar plot you can see we've Quantified based on both modalities the attack on the left and the RNA on the right how much of the different fiber types we observe quite a bit all the way down to adipocytes and less than one percent of the data in your skeletal muscle it's kind of cool so now we focused on the the most abundant cell types for which we would have the greatest statistical power and we did our integration with genetic variation data so cell type specific and type 1 fiber type 2A fiber type 2x fiber the signal stem cells and endothelial cells call eqtl and CA qtl and we get a lot of these right and so the table here represents the different cell types on the y-axis and the different categories either eqtl and blue and you can see we're getting a few thousands of these and it's based on the abundance of the cell type so the more of the nuclei that we get the the better power we have to detect qtl um but the ca qtl we get orders of magnitude more right so there's much larger I think effects genetic effects on chromatic accessibility than on uh gene expression so the next thing we wanted to do is go back and compare to some of these atlases that are widely used in the field so there's a cell paper those recently published a single cell atlas of Chromatin accessibility in the human genome and have skeletal muscle here and I know you probably can't read that but there's about 40 000 nuclei from skeletal muscle where they did a taxi so we wanted to look at our CA qtl especially where there's a genetic effect and say is that caqtl the most important kind of Chromatin peaks in the genome where genetic variation affects it are they represented in the cell Atlas and again here's the example what if your Atlas had an individual with this genotype GG instead of a heterozygous AG or homozygous a individual and we reasoned that the presence in the atlas would be based on two things at the ca qtlp one the effect size the genetic variant have a big effect this has a Whopper effect right like if you have the wrong variance you're basically flat and you want to call a peak there also the minor allele frequency what's the frequency of the allele that corresponds to open accessible data so here's what happens when we compare our CA qtl data to the published reference Atlas on the x-axis here is the effect size of the genetic variant on the left this is a variant with a small effect on the right this is a variant with a very large effect and the y-axis is binned by minor allele frequency of the allele that corresponds to open accessible chromatin and you can see rare rare alleles that influence Chrome accessibility at the top and these are very common open accessibility alleles at the bottom and if you're down here in the part of the graph these are common alleles that affect chromatin opening and they have big effects basically every single one of those 100 of those Peaks are detected as expected in the reference Atlas but as you move to smaller effects and rare alleles you are missing this is corresponds to about 30 percent of the Peaks are in the atlas so you're missing about 70 percent of the most important peaks in the atlas which we think is quite important going to like population scale all right so I will um I was going to talk about some co-localization results but I think I'm going to skip that because I'm at the zero zero time point right now and just no I I think I just included a few too many slides and oh my God I want to say thanks I got to a a really diverse team uh there's six people from the lab that are presenting posters so go check out everything that they're doing I think there's a lot of cool stuff happening beyond the small vignette that I was able to describe and I'll end with saying again happy birthday to dcmb and Bob we're almost teenagers so look out world [Applause]
