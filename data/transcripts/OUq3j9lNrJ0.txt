so uh good afternoon everybody welcome to another DC BC CMB seminar series talk today it's my pleasure introduce jinping feu who's joining us from the he's actually multiple departments but you're you're maint in your homes mecha mechanical engineering but is also a faculty in biomedical engineering and cell and developmental biology so that's quite a diverse portfolio there and should be really interesting talk so please take away so thank you for having me here and as you know as you can see from my applications indeed my home department is mechanic engine department but we work on diverse topics and today I'm gonna talk about really the topic I'm most passionate about it's really mechanobiology and call it associate with human component stem cells so as you can see I'm a feeling with Department engineering as well as cell to vemma know biology if I'm also associate director with Michigan center for integrated research in critical care where we're teaming up with for example clean-cut actors to develop diagnostic tools and for example different clinical applications so that's another part of my research but that's not the part I'm gonna talk about today again we're good I'm gonna talk about McKenna biology of human component stem cells and this is the part I'm most passionate about so human proposes stem cells of specifically human embryonic stem cells and how would you write human brain stem cells you have fertilized egg from in visual fertilization people donate their well they will donate the fertilized egg and then the fertilized egg will divide then eventually by they Phi you have this this structure where people can isolate for example cells individual cells from the inner cell mass and making culture developed cultural masters they can propagate this what Sonali call human embryonic stem cells in vitro they can propagate and they can culture them and people developing tools and Messer's they can differentiate them into different cell types you will realize that they have different cell functions and limiting for example the cells in the body and different cells will have been different type of applications for example or such Plantation and now people are very excited for drug screening and toxicology screening and more importantly we're excited about is using human embryonic stem cells to model human early amber onto them that's what we are passionate about and of course different cell types have very different men different type of applications involve example if you can derive the human components themselves toward for example motor neurons can use motor neurons for either jack screening to identify it soluble factors or superman compounds and to treating for example diseases like ARS Parkinson disease or if you have for example diabetes and you write pancreas cells or this type of treatment so going back to the topic I want to cover we can about you what is really care about it can apology I as I put down here we can about is an emerging field of science at the interface of biology and engineering it books on the way the physical forces and changes in the cell and tissue mechanical environment all they contribute to the development and physiology and disease as a cartoon I have put a very simple cartoon here it's thinking about it's a single cell and adhering single cell and will here in single cell attach themselves to the environment the actual self space right they can attach themselves to the actual cell matrices with what we call focal adhesions here adhesion structures and mediate by transmembrane transmembrane integral receptors and they're experiencing the mechanical forces the factors in the soil in the accessary environment and in addition to the soluble battery so in the past or conventionally biologists in mainly focusing on identify for example the soluble factors when they bind to the receptors that means these two interests our signature instruction pathways that mediate cell behaviors but now these days over the last I would say 1020 years people realized more and more the importance of physical signal so we're talking about the physical signals including for example the shear stress shear flow by the cells exposed to we always know that there's interstitial flow and we also know the blood go it's important for example to maintain the endothelial cell and also in turns out for example many cell they're regularly experiencing stretching forces and you have the force transmitted to the cells and mediate cell function so for us mechanobiology we are interested in can about human components themselves here I would like to define our research here and I want we want to answer a few like want to investigate a few crashes were most interested about our human component stem cells mechanosensitive and if so can be leveraged and on sensitive properties of human component stem cell for example to achieve large-scale efficient production of human component stem cells all their functional directives or functional micro tissues that organize or the junky medicine disease modeling and Jack Scott of Queen and what are the implications of human components tendency are in can apology for early their implications for early human embryonic development disease and aging so through this talk I will provide you some experimental evidence and hopefully can provide some answers or hints or some of the answers some of the questions of you not necessarily we have a complete answer for all of them but I think we have some possible results suggesting mechanobiology is important in human proponents themselves so before I talk about the real data the experimental result with human component stem cells I won't use a few slides to give you some background introduction of all the tools we have developed over the last few years where we can really precisely modulate the mechanical signals the human component stem cell can be experienced or we can use this mechanical tools to precisely modulate the physical signals in the cell culture and so the first cool I want to talk about this is what we call Micro post array it's very simple concept you have this micro post array it's like a copy of pillars right and this pillars they have the same diameter and we can moderate the height very precisely so when you have cells again adherence LCD on on pop-up Michael poster wait if the post is very short it's like stun the cell will exert force on the post as you can see from the cartoon here at the end I'll talk about later the cells will exert force on the surface it's a way for an impact probe the mechanical environment so when the post is short it's very difficult for the cells to bend so they feel this is a rigid surface but when this post become very car is easy for that but a cell could Bend so this is soft post so effectively we are controlling the mechanical rigidity of the surface the cells are experiencing so more recently we're adding we're integrating the microprocessor is on course stretchable membrane so now we can stretch the underlying membrane in such a way that we are applying active forces to the cells so therefore we are adding an active component to itself so as you can see the cutting gear of course a 2 min picture shown at the cells make attachment to the underlying post against Lupul cohesions so one thing I want to note here and if you're not familiar with the actin cytoskeleton structure the active service cards actin cytoskeleton structures they are connecting themselves and to the action set of space through focal engines so this is what we call mechanical continue thinking about the mechanical the exercise of space actual cell matrices and they get connected the publication and focal adhesion get connected with a service card so this is what we called as a mechanical continue connecting the cells noxious aerospace up to impact at the nucleus so now we are using this course to study for example the human component stem cell behaviors as you can see this is a very high resolution SEM scanning in action microscopy image showing a single stem cell in CCD on top of the micro post you see the chest expending of underlying post the cells definitely are exerting a lot of force and honest on on the matrices so in fact using micro fabrication that's really well something we are very comfortable with and we can develop different tools using micro fabrication and in fact we can generate very many many different type of different type of soil micro post you can see let's focus on the car the SEM scanning your actual microscopy images here you can see the post the top post here the centre to attend the distance or micron the diameter of the post is one point in micron and we can moderate the height very precise shape on some micron up to a MIDI 15 15 micron and then the bottom to SEM images showing the post point a micron post and send it to send the distance to micron and again we can moderate the high very precisely going back to in fact if you have any in background you should know that we can easily calculate the spring constant right this is almost like a pillar like a spring you can easily calculate the spring constant of the pillars using this simple expression the capital K here that you're applying this all up annuity equation we can calculate the spring constant is proportional to the fourth power of the dam care of the post and inversely proportional to the cubic of the post height so you can imagine that by modulating the height by tenfold right from one micron up to 10 micron you activity a thousandfold difference in the spring constant and not mention that you can moderate the diameter as well that's what with the ear so really give you a broad range of spring constant where you can any play and you can try to observe whether the rigidity of the micro post will exert impact on stem cell behaviors so more recently we can also example we can again using micro fabrication even spatially patterned the rigidity so that you can see that in this region the post the base of the post that I start so you can see the post the tops of the post they remain on the same surface so effectively we can spatial pattern the mechanical signals so people are interested for example to study how that gradient of mechanical signals can mediate for example directly cell migration just like camel axis right cells they sense the chemical gradient in my grid and in fact it turns out in many many mechanosensitive adhering cells they sense the mechanical rigidity gradient they will migrate and have directional migration who make all those in fact compatible or compatible with conventional cell biology studies in fact we can really generate very large arrays like we can in fact transfer those geometries and from silicon most hopefully example this is 100 millimeter teacher coffee dish and it really we can culture a large amount of cells to make out was very consistent or very compatible with conventional cell biology studies so as I mentioned more recently we are integrating the micro pulse rate on post tractable membrane the concept is very simple you have listen we have this gadget where we have this vacuum chamber and the post is indicated on Uncle the center of the membrane and then we when we activate the vacuum then the periphery of a membrane got sucked into the therefore the central region that equally peroxidase chat therefore the centers in the center of the cell seated on top of the Michel post the equip box it is trashed so the two phase images here you can clearly see that like the centre to centre distance all my chrome before stretch and we're at the strata you can see easy to see that increase the center to send the distance between the post and one critical difference and I'm assuming some of you know that people people also use for example you can sinking about you can continuously or you can culture the cells on a continuous membrane without post and you can stretch the membrane as a way to stretch the cells but in fact is quite different from our system let me explain here so when you stretch impacting our system when you stretch the membrane the strength the deformation of the membrane impact does not propagate up the post in reality the top surface the top geometry of the post does not change as you can see from embedded even the base images here at the top the geometry you can see the square of the circles they don't change in that we're really just applying a force we are now seeing the pokévision directive that's a critical difference for our system versus convention system so a critical question we are very interested in fact over the last few years is to a wireless system to study for smear or cohesion dynamics as a mention at photo heejun's ourselves the heejun structure the cells used attach themselves to the surface is needed by transmembrane integral receptors right here we are using for example a fibroblast cell line expressing stable expressing wide packed accident actually is a focal fusion protein therefore allow us to study in situ for cohesion dynamic so before stretch you can see this is live cell acid you can see individual green dots here those are focal adhesions right you can see the green parts in fact they read regularly position in in fact you can we can easily see that you have one focal adhesion on one post which is not surprising so one minute after curl percent static stretch we stretch the membrane then we hold it right so it's a static stretch so you can see one minute after drastic changes so very obvious so the four conditions they become brighter all the Jaypee signal become brighter and bigger so that's significant almost instantaneous reinforcement of the cohesion and to respond as a response for the cells to such a stretch perturbation so in fact in addition to monitor so now in fact we have a few things we come on here in this experimental platform as I mentioned in the previous slide we can monitor book first the photo heejun I get than anything is passed the intensity and size in fact I didn't mention that in fact the post itself is a very useful tool post monitor to report the force the overall cell exert on the subject because we can easily map out the bending diffraction so for present my caste so therefore we have the force that's the cell exerted on the subtree then we have the focal adhesions that individual cohesions individual green dots in fact if your cost expert if the cells are Co expressing for example the GOP or IP acting you can even see the individual individual acting fibers so again as I was mentioning in one of the slides you can imagine that you have this continuous mechanically mechanic mechanical continuing right from extracellular space cohesion up to actin stress fibers in fact in our system we can we can establish this mechanical continued in a very spatially registered Nana you have individual cohesion connected to individual strands fibers and we can report the traction force exerted by the cell so this is very nice tool impact of study fourth most immediate pokévision dynamics as well as signal alright our stable slide in fact using this platform in addition to study force media for cohesion in fact we can we can even map out the self stiffness cell stiffness you can imagine that you see those cells on above substrate they exert force but at the same time people are also interested how stiff and soft that would sell it the cells are example there's a lot of recent studies identify the stiffness of the cell as a mechanical phenotype of cells impaired layer correlate people have data shown that they have significant correlations with for example if the cells are cancer cells then that has the metastatic States so I'm not going to list the details here but we can use this course map as the subcellular level single cell stiffness so more recently through collaboration with our collaborator dr. Sheridan at the PME department here dr. Sheridan she's an expert using blipping microbubbles to for example check delivery right non-merits paste the gene delivery and if you're familiar with sound operation is a Messer where people use in the P Michael bubble and when the P Michael bubble under stimulation with arches on the lip in Michael bubble let's take a look over the cartoon here so if you have a dip in Michael bubble and are under the stimulation with artists on the lip in Michael bubble not only were rapidly can check and expand again this in fact this is gas bubble so such rapid dynamics of bubble expansion and contraction were leads to a significant shear stress in fact near the bubble blaster stress will nominate a change in pore on the membrane cell membrane so that leads to non merits based jacket ability but in our case we were wondering whether we can use explore the interactions between artists own and the little micro bubbles and/or mechanobiology stuff it turns out in fact under our sounds termination there's also another component that has not been fully exploited in the past this is what we call a caustic radiation force su momentum transfer between artists and the bubble in fact you can exert a directional force on the bubble so that you can manipulate the bubble movement right in fact once we highlight impact if we function the little micro bubbles with for example this is zoom in picture now which for example HD peptides that can be recognized by cell surface receptors so we can find that the we can find a lipid micro bubbles to the cell surface so then under our constellation you can manipulate the artists interaction so you can impact you can manipulate the displacement of the lipid micro bubbles I'll show you a video here you can see it is a single cell and see you on top of the micro post the brass past year those are underlying post so you can see the black spot here that the lipping microbubble so after we activate the artists on you can see the lateral displacement the lateral displacement of the little micro bottle so indeed we can honestly this is a new way we can acquire a local force to the cells so this is very compatible in fact if you're familiar with optical tweezer on magnetic tweezer right people can attach some car styling piece to the cells and by manipulating the beat its location or displacement you can apply a force to the cells so now we can really apply the cell of a local force to the cells let's focus on one key beta here that really I included here in fact I'm not sure if you can really clearly even by applying artists on for 10 seconds or 20 seconds that's the data shows here so we apply the artists on as G equals zero you can see only even ten seconds or 20 seconds donation with the artists on you can see sustain the increase of the cells in terms of their contractile force so the cells are experienced in 10 seconds or 20 seconds stimulation with this what we call a caustic reasoning cytometry but their contractile force will continue to increase for more than 30 minutes in this case so in fact the cells are very responsive to such mechanical stimulation so going back to the main topic so we care about your human components themselves now we have developed so many tools so what's other so the first question as I mentioned whether mechanobiology are sorry human component stem cells will be kind of sensitive a lot in fact of course there's so many different questions you can study and as I mentioned that people are always interested to differentiate the components themselves towards different type of cells even PI bond neurons right for example and in fact we have to choose a system to study to demonstrate or probe our question so then we decided to let's focus on your genetic differentiation the proponents themselves we all know that from Tibet many biologists studies people already even met about you have identified many many soluble factors and what people call morphogens and identify their importance in mediating or dictating in what's in which part of your we in which time of your body or brain and you will have the right type of yawns right why they show up in the right place in the right time as the Lester type of questions pillow most interesting so for example if you take a look up cutting here it is very simple sketch and this is a neuron tissue and you have for growing middle blame him brain and the spinal cord so people identify for example as I mention that the importance of soluble factors in this case right hanging acid ah hey let's do light colony acid very important one of the most important soluble factors and dictating for example there wasn't we call anterior-posterior patterning right establishing this axis so this is for brain is the spinal cord so you have this anterior-posterior patterning this axis establishment and of course if you take a cross-section of each tissue in fact within each tissue you can see that you have different type of neurons or certain type of neurons who are local be localized in a certain region of the picture for example in promote on your arm people know that the position of the motor neurons in the spinal cord is dictated also by soluble factor called the sonic hedgehog you see another soluble activated right again people identify many many different soluble factors and identifying out like following such knowledge foreign to them and apologies given metabolic studies stem cell biologists start to develop in visual culture systems right from human component stem cells if you want to develop for example Kaja protocols for obtain for example motor neurons so the first step then you chew the cells with certain chemicals to drive the cells towards for example what we call not you know absolu cells is its type of them you can conquer self-oriented stem cells then afterwards you can start add different soluble factors in this case rockhounding acid and some funny Hedgehog who drive the new RF city cells the stem cells project ourselves towards for example the this spinal cord progenitor cells then you add more soluble factors many many more and eventually become functional motor nerve and the problem who is such conventional stem cell studies in fact you take a look of the timeline here it take not convention weeks it's sometimes months long time little cultural differentiate embryonic stem cells towards functional cells at the end crucially real function which is not surprising because many turns are many human embryonic stem cells they follow their governmental principles they need to follow away and at the end the problem first is very time consuming to derive direct function cells and the end you realize that also the efficiency and the yield is extremely low as I'll show you the data the end you gather almost like less than 10% yield by even the purity but not necessarily very useful so we are asked asking the question can we improve this process well if human component stem cells they are mechanosensitive can we improve this but of course I highlighted human components that are like at the motor neurons here and I also wrote on around important write associate ways that we generated muscle disease AO acid is that the two famous patients associate lives one unfortunate pathway and because of the disease and one it would step on Hawking it's one arguably the most famous physics and he's lucky enough he's still living right now alright so going back to the the discussion here so we follow two established to identify whether human components themselves on camel sensitive or now we follow a protocol established very recently in fact this is a protocol obviously in nature back in 2009 people identify through soluble factors when ETA beta inhibitory the other one being people inhibitor once you added these two inhibitors into your culture the effect we can drive the human embryonic stem cells to differentiate toward new absolute cells so this the protocol established in this publication so we simply bobble this protocol but we want to repeat the asses so that on our microphones arrays with step and utilities let's take a look at the simple question whether rigidity can affect this process it turns out the answer is yes and the results in fact is very very impressive let's take a look of the data here we comparing in fact we use a very soft micro pulse array this is one kilo Pascal and the religion Y is about one solvent kilopascal we use glass as a positive as a rigid control so with the two inhibitors you can see Jaffee difference in terms of the toxic staining here that the the staining associate with near-absolute sell most of cells as after they a become X 6 pocket in your absolute self but in distinct contrast so you can see widget and glasses many up cells are a people party new apostles so this is basically a by-product in this code protocol so this to confide results in path by the a as as you can see from the stinging results indeed so the pack six path day when you have cells almost you had get 100% xx+ in your absolute self and in contrast is about like close to 30 35 percent and on widget surfaces and we start to see pack six positive cells as early as state or and so this is the Western blot and to confirm the exploding expression level pack 6 and socks one again confronting that the soft substrate promoting the new oxidizer differentiation from human components themselves one thing I made I I didn't mention here it's also very interesting observation here if you remove the LPN as the bmp4 inhibitor from the culture you can see that regardless of the substrate mechanics all the almost all the differentiations get pushed away from your absolute differentiation they are more towards they become more towards bias towards you know classification this is very interesting in fact because of this identify this suggests that the BNP for media it's masculine unlikely get involved in this mechanosensitive behaviors of human components themselves so the contrary results are here the you can see that is a percentage of pack up itself so for AP 2 you can see when we remove LD and majority of cells become a people path that in your castle so this is very interesting and in fact indeed we have mechanistic data suggesting as masculine is involved in this process so we further perform real-time PCR to further confirm the gene expression of human components themselves and so in the previous slides I mentioned that so we basically use the very rigid versus very soft one Pascal versus one solvent pure Pascal so in fact then we decided let's take a look of add more conditions rigidity conditions to the assay so that let's take a look it would let us any interesting finding it turns out in this case you can see we added a few more liquidity conditions and we stain the cells for pack six as day to day for day six and they ate and even from on sustaining images you can see as this within the range we tested here it seems like this is the compiled results y axis here or T axis here is percentage of pack six part themselves as function of time and the substrate mechanics it since likely there's a stretcher between PI kilopascal protein kilopascal below dissoluteness ratio it seems like legit he has the softness at just the impact promoting you know absolute or differentiation so we further compare our experiment using induced pluripotent stem cells this is a sent a cell line a obtained from our collaborator Park rats back as University of Michigan and it's the induced induced pluripotent stem cells are derived from human skin fiber path and again you see similar behaviors the soft subject will promote your absolute optimization so another key experiment we we demonstrate it so as I mentioned in one of the early slides so the first step is you drive human components themselves towards in your absolutely cell then you have to give the cues for the new absolu cells so that it becomes differentiate to what neurons that have specific identities you have two equivalents um patterning cues so that they become either neurons associated with forebrain for example on neurons are social with spinal cord what in this case in fact we this is the acid protocol we divide so the first four days we used these two inhibitors then after four day of culture you're adding rat chronic acid to the culture again right honey acid is a soluble factor that would drive effectively what drive the cells become posterior identity cells that's the cells for example a social waste spinal cord so by day a we let's take a look up the expression levels for these markers OT x2 is the anterior marker is a transcription factor associated with an Tyrael neurons and Hox genes are very important and people very important very specific markers associates posterior posterior nuance so by day a let's tickle at least the confine results real-time PCR you can see that without right here on the acid you can see draftee enhance the expression for the Hox genes with all right on the acid even with right honey acid that's the soluble factor and you can subtract a improvement enhanced enhancement for the Hawks people and Hawks da so we further performed a staining to compare the protein expression levels for Cody x2 and the Hawks ox before and the comparing region soft conditions you can see you need a confronting that in addition to the fact that soft substrate will promote the human component stem cells to differentiate what new AB silly cells it turns out a soft subject will promote the differentiation for the new axilla cells or neurons associate with posterior at anything he has some I didn't as the soft substrate what Duran you are panting what identity so we further land to get a functional motor neurons you have to again you have to add more factor unfortunately so we really we have to extend the a say what now they 23 by the 23 we start with we can stain the cells for HB 9 and an empire 30 we can stain the cells or other markers that just focus on the data we are pinned upon day 23 that's the marker we use HP 9 as very specific transcription factor associate with motor neurons in fats the only marker are biologists believe that can specifically identify motor neurons so HB 9 this is the percentage of HP night cells we obtain for our cell culture after 23 days of Carter you can see almost hopeful improvement in terms of culture so this is percentage of cells basically is the purity of the cells you are getting the motor neurons more importantly if we plot this is an ammonite hb9 cells and we get more than 10 for improvement so this is the nominal cell number as indicate this is the yield how many cells you are getting on your cell culture so there's a 10 fold improvement so nonetheless so the motor neurons of course with suit crabber ation we have to use for conventional single self is unlike as a catch can catch plan catch clamp asses to further confirm they are indeed a functional indeed with on many essays so as I mention that involved at the first slice I mentioned that when we renew the PMP fall in here it turns out that we are driving all the cells towards our cells that's suggesting that bmp4 medius masculine unlikely is involved it turns out that before we start thinking about the mechanistic picture underlying that we cannot sense the behaviors of human components themselves we notice very true prominent papers so the first paper in fact that's published in nature is about in 2008 identify the importance of yet passed as a cofactor that binds who is a require post match and rotation to the nucleus in humans and second that basically this is that happens shown here so you have snap and possible snap translocate to the nucleus right immediate downstream gene expression it turns out it's translocation requires finding yet it turns out when you not done yet paths so let's the data here when you use s are a knock-down pads that's the dry part here you see just the improvement increase of the pack six perfect cells that's the new absolute right all right that's the information we obtained on this paper and secondly there's a very prominent paper published in Nature in 2010 this is the one of the most important discovery in the counter biology over the last I would say 10 years identified yet pads themselves are nuclear transducers involved in regulating you know sensitive properties of a tall Nieminen cells or in this primary studies they have not examined human components themselves it turns out let's take a look of the data here when they culture the cells on top versus the rigid conditions you can see the stain here this is a soft condition if the rigid condition you can see on rigid surfaces the cells that yet pads they localize in the nucleus but on soft substrates it very diffusive they did primary localized in the cytoplasm outside also so this is the con 5 itself so identify a path as very important McCanless transducers and kendal transducers and involved in human development in itself so our hypothesis is yep as media nuclear accumulation of smells regulate rigidity and the neural induction of human proponents and again the physical picture is here so we know that from this study that was for phosphorus math they translocate to the nucleus and the parts final yet it also turns out that yep is very important bounced really factor involved in hippo signal it turns out I will provide more information about a hippo signal in my following slide so therefore let's let's take a look of whether first experiment whether rigidity we'll have it back media is mass economy so the first experiment is rather straight boy we pop on Western blot let's take a look of possible it's not that's math economy and you can see indeed Ricci surfaces were promotes map of valuation right and well that's great let's take a look at the app and indeed in human embryonic stem cells again all the asses of component in human embryonic stem cell so you can see that zero and basically this is 24 hours of the seeding of itself on on a subject you can see that only two surfaces in here yet what well localized concentrate themselves in the nucleus and well in contrast they were localized in the cytosol of itself on the thought subject on soft soft subject so this is the percentage of nuclear yet again confirming that a little country without obtain Palestinian ages the cells that yep tasks they in for cells see the on widget services they localized in the nucleus and purple cells on the soft surfaces they localized inside also and this is the western part and where we are paying it attract proteins protein fractions are the nuclear protein fractions and cytosol protein fraction again confirming that on for a cell seeded on soft subjects they localize in the example your cats were prefer to localize in the in the cytosol and that you can see also co-localization of Japan with snap and sensing in contrast for the cell see the only G surfaces yep at prefer to localize in the nucleus again you can see the colocalization of your path with snap which is consistent with private study so that's the first experiment and also let's thinking about your cats hawlucha DT we know that yep can controls match translocation but then the question is how mechanics regularly yep activity right and what's the mechanism it turns out yet again as I mention that is a very important bouncing a factor involved in hippo signal in hippo signaling impact upstream of yep there's a very important kinase is called ad and this last can phosphor yep and phosphor yep find another scaffold protein protein - 3 3 and make the phosphor yet unavailable to inhibit yep activities this is one of the most important mechanism involved in hippo regulation it turns out let's take a look then we decide to let's take a look of the importance of yep and lat so we will perform the Western block let's take a lot of weather soft substrate and rigidity can mediate yep phosphorylation this is the most important site downstream of lads list this particular phosphorylation site you can see the upper recreation of yep phosphorylation and then we perform more importantly we use SRA is last SR a knockdown lat and you can see indeed we can knock down that and once we knock down that as expected you can see down regulation of this phospholipid on a when we use this SMA to cheat to the cells at the song actually cells will open the sing acid for the differentiation you can see drastic suppression of the mechanics effect at least the compiled resulting and see will need not last basically don't see this rigidity is that in promoting the you know absolutely position but effectively so it turns out there's some way that when you see the cells on soft substrates Laska activated we still don't know why but latzke activated and Osprey yep and then yep Oscar yep bind to another protein and McClain unavailable to mediate translocation of office nap so basically this is a very simple I have we have more data but this is a very simple picture now after the discussion so indicating how rigidity mediate the new absolute of the transition we have rigid surfaces then the last for some reason not activated and you can see a kind of Hindi Blatt last bind to actin fibers it turns out lads is a actin binding protein but again this is a hypothesis so only two surfaces you have actin stress fibers and that's fine too actin stress fibers Nicklin unavailable to us for a yep so yellow can bind to snap authorized mat the transfer transfer phosphorus net of the nucleus but then in fact this become promoting the cells embryonic stem cells they are self renewal program but when you have soft sub phase then the diffusive acting structures and promoting lads their activation and then phosphor yep and nickname unavailable chance translocate the phosphorus map and of course as we one of the data suggests that the soft substrates it turns out that it also can inhibit the snap phosphorylation as well so this is what we call mark targeted in chemistry instructed mechanisms involving many many different players right which is not surprising impact when we're talking about mechanobiology is never a seen single pathway or never a single player monocle player in this case you can see many many different players there's a hippo pathway there's a smack phosphorylation right boundary BMP signal so let's go to the next that the the the last part of my part so maybe I have five or ten minutes I guess be permanent so this is really the modeling part as I indicate in my title I call the title of my talk is you cannot control mechanical control and modern night of the new people in stem cell I think of my talk the part my private slides and that's the control part now let's talking about the modern part but the modeling part I'm talking about here it's not necessary computational modeling no it's definitely I'm not completely so now we are talking about using human component stem cells from model human early embryonic development I can read about model systems study and Vancouver me so one specific step very critical in human component stems out the diamond is numeration so you can think about by week three right which we after gastrulation you're all know like a situation you have three different generators act at there an end of them acted in Macedon and end of them and between the week 3 and week or week 4 and then this enumeration will happen between this week 3 and week for some magic will happen with magical will happen so the street generator then there's this what we call like Newark wait what did better right you can see the cutting gear that you are playing what about you know accident issue what about you having this newer actor turn in the middle and then you have these you have lists in your quest as order and then you have this non neuro actor database can act dermis right and eventually this new activity will fold and form the newer tube of course neuro tube is very important it owns your brain wants to the spinal cord right of course any dysregulation of this process leads to for example births people like this is a spy spina bifida and that's not necessarily Lisa but there's some other war some other stuff but anyway so some magical will happen but given our marriages identify the importance of being peace economy right many many soluble factors and the opportunity gradients BMP signaling in turns out is one of them take a look up the SCAF here so people identify the importance of the NPS economic people believe that the grading of the mp7 only what media will regulate this new actor Terran tissue formation the people identify that believe that the high BMP signaling well is true for example at Germany so you know acted or none you acted an issue and then low BMP signaling wali stood that needle part that's the newer plate and somewhere in the middle people Sinclair that leads to new oppressor of course so you can easily argue that where people can to develop simple series that explain since it turns out indeed but also people observe that point even apologies studies in fact in early and pontiff and there's many many mechanical factors involved right cells move like crazy that they rearrange themselves on tissues full and form cavities there's many many mechanical factors which is right this is the best example in fact is the newer tube culture as one of the example that as we labeled title suggests here in fact it's a bottom chemical protest so now the question is can we model this this process it turns out indeed we can in fact it's it's also impact you can see when we patent the again we use the same protocol in fact as we published as we've shown use the two inhibitors here so in fact you can Charlie as you remember we can job in your absolute other than human components stem cells towards New York rest cells on your F City cells then always you have this by-product as I was mentioning in your crest cells as a by-product in the culture in fact it turns out that if we culture the cells but in this case we are culturally cells in a colony so we find a way there we can control the cell will grow enough for example severe cuts like circular economy so this is a two-dimensional surface right by time Oh so by deny you can see the base image right the cells form very nice colony it turns out even on the face microscope you can see almost like a tool cell operation to population itself the in the center Liam definitely more closely packed together and the cells on the periphery they're more more loosely connected and they more loosely connected then of course we stay in the cell and we use packs tree is again in your castle matter and then pack six thick one and ms x 1 these are the oh sorry pack six is the neuron you know absolute cells matter and pack three and thick one and ms x one is on your crest mothers so you can see the him apps here the pack six have given your absolute cells that they concentrate in the center and the lamp acts 3 after Altec 1 + ms x1 partly your car cells will prefer to localize on the colony on the periphery of the column right we further perform a live cell assays in fact this is a reporter cell line and like 16 g AP cell line and sixth and again it's a your crescent market the basically if we see green signal indicator that's a new appraisal by doing the transition so over time you can see day four they a5 a6 by day six you we start to see that the twenty cells those are soft and positive thought it start to show as the periphery of calm so indeed it's now like it the cells were differentiate into your absolute also neural crest cells then is self segregate our self sorting is it turns out the cells on the periphery of the colony they decide to become your crassius the cells in the center they decide to become your ab citizens so effectively in fact we are generating a neural activity to here where you have neural crest on your absolute cells in the center and neural crest cells on powerpoint so of course we're asking the question why this is happening in fact we notice that during the differentiation during the assay the cells when we see that the cells the cells are rather uniform but over time because this is neither a or nine days culture over time the cells or constantly what will start who rearranged themselves or really adjust themselves the cells in the center become more packed they in fact become more elongated it's very consistent with the previous picture cut home i was shown in government about on your active during issue they become elongated the teacher and those cells become new absolute cell same thing happening in our culture in fact if we stay in Tier one that's basically allow us to to see the cell morphology the cells in the century definitely smaller and also when we cheated the cells without studying which blocked contractility of acting contractility they become more uniform disability so this is the project excel area and at the center at center is smaller and the powerplay they are bigger and when we choose the cell phone basically we eliminate this difference and because we can use the force at the post to measure the force as well in fact it turns out that the colony in within the colony that cells on the parent way they exert stronger forces again when we use the perhaps that and that will eliminate bit different and so when we the data all right so when will you stop studying same thing happening and we when we stay in the pack three you can see we basically eliminate this spatial distribution of tax-free positive you know across cells the list the control where the packs really passed itself on percolate only you stop studying this really eliminate this you know actodine tissue pattern so then the question is now we see that the cells on the periphery they only perfectly a bigger they exert higher force and why that's how that contribute who list new acted during tissue formation right while at least two new oxidizers in the center in your crest cells on perfect it turns out we have the data here and i will explain to you it turns out that cell morphology cells shape itself can mediate BMP signal so i explain the data here so we can see that when we see the commonly are seeded cells with low density this is five thousand cells per square centimeter and this is twenty thousand cells per square centimeter and we stained the phosphorus map again this is the downstream the factors of smash second only so you can see the phosphorus map primarily localized in the nucleus identifying this is the PNG active BMP signaling but when we see themselves with high density and the BMP signaling get drastically used so same thing when we when we use the Pabst Adam who shoot the cells and the BMP signaling get that biscuit in eliminating to further confirm that the cells shape had drastic it back on BMP signaling we even put on single cell assays so where we can combine the cell area single cell area this is a single cell assay so this is the sale area this is the 500 micron square micron and this is the one 1600 square icon and you can see that the phosphorous Network or localized in the nucleus well in this case in the smaller self that diffusive in the side of the soul if the county by we got so we even perform real-time PCR and comparing the low density high density versus low Sheen density again this is the pocket jeans in P pocket jeans and suggesting that and either lower seed intensity leads to higher a larger cell area and will promote the NPC grown-ass man activity and this is in fact the single cell on the single cell data again I only present partially that data suggesting that the mechanics the cell area itself can mediate BMP signal so going back to the discussion of the founder conventional event mental biology people identify the MP signaling it's important it turns all that the mechanics provide a gating mechanism that can reinforce this PNP media signal right as a control mechanism me make sure that the demand meant events can properly be executed in the dependent events so I think I will stop here I'm not sure if I wrong Otto so I would really acknowledge acknowledge that students who really make this our research possible here and the V being is really that student who was the cornerstone in my lab for human component stem cell now his assistant professor at UMass Amherst setting up his own lab now I have two fantastic senior PhD student what gradually assumes no Undergear so they are also very important and in the team performing research on human components turns out there rest of my group Illya working on some other non rated research and discuss appear so these are my collaborators sound plan as um some different institutions these are the funding agent agencies panadol so thank you very much and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer any questions it was a really great talk I was interested in your data that showed how the rigid e of the substrate that the cells were growing on really promoted stemness it seemed like stem cells like a more rigid matrix almost wondering if you an idea about why that was and if we can take that information to get hints about where stem cells might exist within the stem cell niche in vivo so indeed that you are right my data indeed oh I it is true that it turns out that rigid surfaces is the right niche condition to promote human proponent stem cell their self renewal it is true and so all that really can hand us I'm trying to remember what you were you were asking all that about the rigidity yes in its relationship to stemness and try to try to horse that into information about where stem cells might exist within our tissue right oh I see I see but of course the data we have here is it turns out in turn solid then make it more clear it turns out that so many different stem cell right in the adult body that many type of also adults themselves it turns out indeed that the mechanosensitive behaviors or adult stem cell for example yes cell type-specific not necessarily the Knology for example generally in our case in human component stem cells and Bank stem cells can be easily translated directly to example adult stem cell in fact when we perform the research for example indeed we we had a separate paper specifically investigating rigidity halt affecting proposals in maintenance of human components themselves before last study we were hoping that we were expecting little soft surface micromolar policy by turns out is it's different it's certain it turns out rigid surfaces better so let's something surprising to us but it's also understandable given that in fact now we have a kind of idea what's the intracellular signaling pathways involved example this massive all right it's important mediating example phosphorus mass is required turns out or proponents seem independence and it turns out rigid surfaces is it promotes mass signal right so that's a so cool so I would say that it's definitely mechanobiology research is moving forward now people are starting to understand more the intracellular mechanisms right you cannot sense the mechanic transductive magnums and signal pathways involved then once we really have a good understanding about the intracellular part I seem to allow me more helpful to answer that the question you are you ask one is that what the degree of stretch the highest degree of wetness can do we can almost go up to 20% 20% yeah there's also like as high as you want because we're engineers actually we're engineers anything but but why you go go really high is sometimes really the cells become really unhappy little detach that's something but in part is 20% let's normally the limit beyond 20% strategy we study so it become warm thought lately to detach themselves on the surveys look at the downstream start is more difficult right so it seems like it doing something to the the confirmation of the model the confirmation of yeah you you speed up the transformation and seems like you're doing something at the molecular level is there any evidence for that monocle level I guess your part maybe to connect your question to the two sales church yeah right so indeed I think so as I was showing that that's a important that we were very interested for example for cohesion also the Haitian structured cells used to example connect themselves to the actual space it indeed a lesser molecular level picture for example catches the bond that's a Cassidy bomb for example it turns out many many of the molecular players involved in the system you have we're talking about integrins we are talking about acting we are talking about there's a lot of associate proteins for example even tax lien or vinculum those are focal adhesion proteins many of them involved in mediating pokévision dynamics they have this cash slip on behaviors and they many of them were mediated for example the several response I'm talking about for example the pokévision is reinforcement or the action structure there than any remodeling they will be involved in immediately this is mediated cell response oh okay okay all now you are talking about tissue folding if you're talking about the last part like this new rock deterrent issues folding then you we're talking that's the next level of challenge so right now in fact all research the last parts that modeling parts the two-dimensional but indeed I didn't include the data now we are moving into 3d because indeed if you're talking about human early embryonic development we are talking about three dimensional behavior cell behavior you're talking about tissue polling in 3d all of structures to draw structures we're moving towards the attraction and we have a lot of exciting results I think this will get more excited you made the point that your system with micro pillars and your ability to stretch then the underlying membrane allowed you to apply forces without altering the geometry the geometry changing that interface in reducing displacements on the interface do you know of sort of biological examples where that distinction is is actually important in terms of because I imagine these focal adhesions actually you know as they transduce the the force they probably are deforming right so yes I'm wondering what you know if there are biological examples where that distinction is really really critical or we're still sort of looking for those no not necessarily I wouldn't put as one distinct advantage provided by a system I was just like surely like stressed unless it's try to clarify that it's like critical different because if I don't mention that I don't think that people can easily see that difference yeah but indeed I think that difference itself it's a important to clarify it because you can easily we can also argue that easily expect that when you strike the strength of a cohesion right for example then the ink you can imagine that the inter inter Monica Monica space right you're directly strain the cohesion in between molecules and itself likely will have significantly bad but in all case I feel that our system will provide a simpler mechanical perturbation they say right it's directly a force you're basically just applying a force without changing directly impacting the morphology so just a quick question to build on that if I'm understanding this correctly that's really talk it's see these are mostly this is all focused on single cells right individual cells right so have you considered you know collections of cells on these same sort of micro pillars and how perturbations to one of those cells might affect the confirmations and mechanical properties of the other cells well these are great questions that yeah should be started okay no we have not Sulli looking into that question but yeah it's always the thing right you know you this is so impressive and then it's like well what are you doing that the next big thing right but I don't think we have the right cool right one of the APC that cost using sitamma tree allow us to perturb the cells locally for example within your monolayer of cells if we for example we loaded the bubbles locally anytime we can do that and we can locally perturb once there are a small group of cells to see all that perturbation transmitted propagate propagates yeah and in fact it yeah III single likely in fact questions like that can be very important is related to depend on about feedback right birth defects any any more questions all right well thank you again [Applause]
