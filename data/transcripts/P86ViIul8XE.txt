and it's like my head and any slides of Ranma can be so how do you want to give it that wolf guess so I would say I have some figures and stuff so maybe good to see the slides in there unless you think just putting it directly is not the slides are all one separate thing that the pictures of separate things so it's it's like see how that feels look okay oh yeah yeah yeah perfect that's so perfect so some kind of the year had other stuff yeah that's perfect so if I if I point to stuff on the screen is it going to show up there I mean there's a way where we do you want to sit out and mouse that's the drawback yeah we don't have like a hand-held mouse okay the point neuroticism does not translate okay so I'll try to do the describe I'll try to just say because if you were given it live we have more options here just stand over there okay okay I want to look at my notes and of course that just makes it better no but I'm just saying that that part of the talk anyway yeah okay just don't even think about it okay fine all right you want to worry about interruptions well that's all those hardball questions no that won't make it accessory okay so I've got so this is just allowed you to see in here okay okay so I think I'll just like set my nodes on the edge of the table have access to those I'm just going to get a little sound check to make sure that you have even lay here this pretty good with turning heads and everything if I move my head around yeah so I would stand for two reasons that way you're not like don't have your head in the projector yeah yeah so go ahead and just say a couple things testing would you three siblings go test test test unified medical language system University of Michigan Department of Communication or is it is it oh it's not on room mics that will pick up solvent so it's hard that's test test unified medical language system University of Michigan that's better okay good yeah right there where you're at just go back the ad make sure you turn the recording off okay so they'll keep running you just kill the thing all right good luck thank you thank you thank you this is my big speech for the last two days if my machine it's only right can't be done there isn't a version of you giving the stop but what about the flux capacitor and the lightning bolt in 1984 I wish what I thought wishful thinking all right here goes right okay thanks again yeah I'm just gonna completely close this okay all right so ready to go yes sir okay I'm gonna take just a second get psyched up okay okay thank you for the opportunity to present today I'm Tyler Nix I'm an information estat the Taubman Health Sciences Library and I'm gonna present today an introduction to the National Library of medicines unified medical language system for just a little bit of context on my background and experience with the umls I worked on a user survey at the National Library of Medicine a couple of years ago but I'm not a programmer so I may not be able to answer all of your technical questions but I wanted to present on this from the context of it being a tool that you may find useful excuse me that you may find useful to use in your research so today we will cover what is the umls we'll kind of talk about the component parts and how it's organized and set up we will look at a use case for the umls in information retrieval we'll look at a related tool called meta map that is a text mining tool that's based on the UML s we will look at some of the source ontology x' that make up the content of the UML s and we'll talk about some access and licensing issues and just to kind of give an overview ontology for today's context we're just talking about basically any sort of terminology system that defines the way that knowledge is God let me have to start over sorry no problem head trip okay do you think it'd be easier if the room were full of people or yeah because my instinct is to kind of look around and then there's no one there and I'm going horse okay or I may just do the whole thing I may just stare at you the whole time yeah it's no problem okay [Music] thank you for the opportunity to speak today I'm Tyler Nix I'm an information as well my star thank you thank you thank you all right thanks for the opportunity to present today I'm Tyler Nicks I'm an information estat the Tom in Health Sciences Library to give you a little bit of context on my background with the umls I worked on a user survey associated with the umls a couple of years ago so I'm not a programmer I may not be able to answer all of your technical questions but I'm going to give you an overview of the National Library of medicines unified medical language system as a tool from the context of a tool that you may find useful in your research applications so we'll cover some basic information about the umls what it is what it's comprised of we will look at a use case of the umls in information retrieval we'll look at a related tool called meta map we will look at some of the source ontology --zz that make up the umls and we'll talk about some of the accessing access and licensing issues with using the umls and while we're still in this slide I'll just take a moment to define for today's talk at least that we're going to be talking about ontology as any sort of system that represents biomedical knowledge within a computer system so basically the unified medical language system is a large database of existing biomedical ontologies that are brought together and so that could include terminologies controlled vocabularies ontology x' and we're talking about we're talking about terminologies like icd-10-cm or sno-med CT or the medical subject headings gene ontology so these are kind of some of the examples of ontology x' that exists within the u MLS and we'll look at these in more detail as we go forward so what is the unified medical language system again it's a set of database files and applications that integrates biomechanical terms from hundreds of existing biomedical technologies I'm just going to catch up on my notes here so this is the the homepage for the UM LS the you MLS is kind of a conglomeration of database files and applications and tools so this home page is going to be your best starting point for finding the files themselves that make up the UM LS and the software and also for for any support and training documentation some of the common uses it's often used as a term bank in natural language processing pipelines it is used as a data annotation resource for custom ontology development a match list or search engine retrieval and for linking disparate databases and applications and so to this last point we're going to look at an example of how this sort of linking disparate databases actually works so you see that you MLS is in the middle of this of this graph here and basically it includes ontologies that are associated with very domain-specific databases so some of the examples that we see are the O mem ontology that's linked and used as the basic ontology for several of genetic knowledge bases it includes the medical subject headings which is the controlled vocabulary that is used to index PubMed and clinical trials.gov it includes gene ontology that you see in the in the bottom right corner there for genome annotations and several others around and so the way that you the you MLS can help to link disparate databases and disparate information resources is that you could imagine if you if you are interested in certain certain records in in ohm M or a gene database you could you could search and find the the affiliated indexing terms for those gene annotations or gene records and then within the you MLS mapped those over to medical subject headings so that that would allow you to automate a search that would pull in for example related PubMed articles I'm so it's it's this idea of using ontology from disparate databases to connect together through the you MLS so how is the you MLS set up that it allows for this sort of connection to happen the MLS is really kind of a conglomeration of three different sets of files so it's it's not one thing it's it's the met at the source which is where terms from hundreds of different controlled vocabularies are brought together so it includes ontology concepts terms hierarchies and relationships from several hundred existing biomedical ontologies then each one of those terms is assigned a semantic category it's basically like like saying a Ford Mustang is a car or Etta mama is food every single concept within the medical source is also assigned kind of a broader semantic heading there are also some lexical tools that are associated associated with the umls but we're not going to cover those in depth today so the medical source has 14 million terms from 200 about 200 biomedical ontologies again we mentioned some of these that you may be familiar with already the gene ontology medical subject headings sno-med CT or just a few examples and the medical source is not just a static container for all of these vocabularies it actually has some pretty powerful integration principles where it brings these terms together and links synonymous terms together at the concept level so how does that work the first of the integration principles is that synonymous terms are grouped as concepts so what we're looking at here is a screenshot from the online met at the source browser it's really just a way to access the medical source online typically if you were using it it's it's middleware it's not really intended for end-user use so you would usually be you know accessing these files through a relational database or in an application but just for today's purposes it's easy to kind of look at it this way so what we see is a concept record for neurofibromatosis 2 which is a benign tumor of the inner ear and we see in this concept record we have the atoms expanded below the concept itself so the concept has been given a unique identifier the C 0 0 to 7 832 so it has a human and machine readable unique identifier at the concept level and you see underneath the atoms represent all of the ways that this concept has been represented across the 200 or so vocabularies within the umls so we see in the brackets there are several vocabularies or there are several listings right here in the middle in the brackets that say icd-10-cm so icd-10-cm represents the contest the concept neurofibromatosis - as acoustic neurofibromatosis so what you MLS is doing here is that for an end user or for a programmer it would allow you to pull together synonymous terms that are used across multiple databases under one concept okay so just to catch up on slides quickly you see the concept at the top by the red arrow synonyms from multiple ontologies down below and we see in the highlight some of the potentially very different terms or very different ways that ontology z' might represent the same concept the second integration principle is that individual ontology hierarchies and term attributes are preserved so not only is the UML s pulling together synonymous concepts or synonymous terms but as it does that it maintains the provenance of the original vocabularies as well so to see an example of that we're back to our neurofibromatosis to record and we see in the context tab down below this is an example of how neurofibromatosis 2 again it's represented in icd-10-cm which is one sample ontology and we see under the ancestors tab we see some of the snippet of the hierarchy of where that concept exists within icd-10-cm and we also see some of its sibling records within its own original hierarchy so that's kind of the idea of bringing together synonymous terms while also maintaining the provenance of original sources as well and that idea is represented here by this graph so depending on what your use is for you MLS in terms of how granular or coarse you might need a particular set of terms to be in an application that you're developing you can see how by creating one graph from these individual trees you would have the option theoretically to use terms at a more granular level like terms as a is related to H or you could use terms in between and a much finer and level with all the steps there between a and H and the third ontology integration principle is that relationships expressing meaning are recorded among concepts basically this is saying that related terms are linked across concepts and that might come from there are individual vocabularies and ontology or these may be relationships between terms that have actually been manually added by metathesis editors or by kind of end users in concerted efforts to map certain vocabularies to one another so again back to our example of neurofibromatosis too to see an example of this we see some of the concept relations some of the other concepts within the umls that neurofibromatosis 2 is related to and one to point out here that we'll see in an example here in just a minute is the NF - gene that's a tumor suppressor gene so a mutation in the NF - gene is related to developing this particular neoplasm so some of the associated relationships that may exist in the umls we see a couple here they could be hierarchical like penicillin is a more specific type of antibiotic or they could be causal like a bacterial infection causes it's caused by a particular bacterium and again the example there with a tumor and a suppressor gene so so far we've been looking at how individual terms are related to each other across vocabularies and within vocabularies in the meta thesaurus but as I mentioned earlier there's also this kind of additional layer of abstraction whereby all of the 3 million or so concepts within the umls are assigned to at least one semantic category so in this case neurofibromatosis - has assigned as the semantic type neoplastic process there are 133 semantic types these are basically ways these are entry points into the MLS where where terms are class together by different meanings and categories so using these semantic types in an application would allow you to for example pull all of the terms in the you MLS that are related to medical devices access all the terms that are related to ideas or concepts all terms that are neoplastic processes etc not only are there semantic types but these types are defined in several different relationship types several different relationships to one another so neoplastic process is related to the semantic type pathologic function with the relation type is a there there are hierarchical relationships causal relationships you see a few of the examples here on this slide and so basically what this allows is it creates this it creates a network of meaning throughout the umls and it allows you to extract concepts and build frameworks of entry terms or index terms that are based around certain meaning and let me catch up with my notes very quickly it also allows you again to pull large lists of concept terms by category without having to know every single term within that category okay so moving on so so this is all been pretty high-level so far we're gonna start to to put it together a little bit and see a couple of examples of how this actually gets used so we're leading up to that but just to quickly recap the structure of the umls is to collect synonymous terms across multiple vocabularies an example here would be heart attack myocardial infarction cardiac arrest to extract the relationships that exist between concepts and it also makes it possible to obtain a full set of concepts for a given category so all of that is kind of summed up in this figure that we're going to take up just a minute to walk through to hopefully bring all this home a little bit more so we see in the middle the middle terms are representing a representative of umls concepts we see neurofibromatosis 2 on the far left we see a couple of its synonyms or it's synonymous terms in the box there with it the little swirly lines with the Diamonds right represent a relationship between concepts so we see that it's related to the NF to gene and both of those are also related to this tumor suppressor protein called Merlin so those are examples of what concepts would look like within the umls then on the top part of the slide we see that each one of those concepts is assigned a semantic type so neurofibromatosis 2 is a neoplastic process NF 2 as a gene and Merlin is an amino acid and then down below in the bottom part of the diagram here we can see how this sort of structure would allow linking across disparate resources so from the Merlin record the Merlin concept record within umls happens to have a unique identifier for its corresponding record in the gene ontology so because that is already mapped into the umls you could use a concept record to link out to GenBank and pull Drosophila studies that are related to this protein that you're interested in and similarly with neurofibromatosis and linking directly out to mmm so this would allow you potentially if you had if you're working on a gene expression annotation something like this could potentially allow you to expand the metadata associated with your annotate to potentially expand the use cases for that and again this is still somewhat high-level so we're going to take a moment to just look at a concrete use case here I'm going to catch up in my notes so this is we're gonna look at a team that has used the UML s to enhance a search engine algorithm and this is a study that was performed here at the University of Michigan led by dr. David Hanauer and several other people from across campus so I'm gonna give kind of a 30,000 foot view just so that we can look at specifically how the U MLS was was used here but if you have questions about the study please do feel free to contact them so basically the problem that this team was trying to was working on addressing was that clinicians and researchers don't always have time to create a perfect search stream to search the electronic healthcare records over in Michigan medicine and the EHR search engine is called immerse so what they did was built an algorithm that uses you MLS terms through this tool called meta map which we'll talk about in a minute to identify medical concepts from the search queries and then it Maps those medical concepts back to the you MLS and leverages all of the synonyms that are available in the you MLS as well as a set of synonyms that were developed here at the University of Michigan to expand on that original search query so this is a diagram of what the study looks like kind of how the algorithm works and you can see meta map in the you MLS being used in a couple stages of this study so to build an initial index for this search algorithm the researchers used meta map and the umls to extract medical terms from a set of EHR documents and to index to build basically an index out of all of those terms that were extracted from the EHR and then down on the bottom left of the diagram we see that so the next phase would be that researcher or clinician at Michigan medicine would come over to immerse and put in their search query and it might be something like patients with heart disease they search for patients with heart disease running in the background meta map in the you MLS would extract all the biomedical terms from that search query and then those terms would be further kind of filtered using semantic types that are specifically targeted for clinical terms and once the search was targeted to the most clinical terms so in this example of putting in a search like patients with cardiac disease the term cardiac disease would be isolated as a type of symptom then that term would be sent back to the umls to have all to have synonyms and medical concepts and abbreviations and acronyms and all these kind of related extra terms appended to the search to make the search more powerful when it runs back through the index so that's that's one use case just an example to give you hopefully a little bit more of a concrete idea of how this could be used in practice so because we mentioned that meta map here as part of this study will take just a moment to look at meta map a little bit more closely again it's a very closely related tool to the umls it's also developed by the NIH and it is a tool that allows - it basically retrieves and identifies umls terms from within free text samples so we're looking at a view of the of the web-based tool there's also a tool you can download to use locally and an API version as well but basically the idea is you put in a sample of free text and meta map runs that free text and matches all of the biomedical terms that it can find to you MLS terms so an example here this is from a treatment guideline from The Endocrine Society and we see just a brief text snippet here it's some free text about glycemic control for pregnant women and if we were to run that through meta map what we see is that all of the potential biomedical phrases have been identified within this free text sample and mapped to to you MLS concepts so we see the phrase Task Force has been identified within the you MLS we see in brackets the abbreviations for the ontology is where that term appears and in parentheses that's a mapping score that's a strength score basically how certain or how strong is this match from the free text to the vocabulary so we see in the about three-quarters down the meta mapping for women we see that the term woman has been used in several vocabularies here including mesh ‰Ùd sno-med CT and several others and the same applies for diabetes and several other terms as well so this may be a tool that you could combine with with something like a term Bank to start looking into natural language processing and text mining applications um so far we've talked about the umls overall kind of very broad level and how terms are pulled together into concepts but we're going to take just a minute to talk about some the individual ontology z' that are housed within the US as they might be again of interest to your research so gene ontology is useful for annotating gene products across various model organisms it started out as the ontology that underlies flybase and a few other databases and is now used across a pretty wide range of gene related databases and data sources and you can get a better idea of what those are at gene ontology org the NCI hugo gene nomenclature this is an ontology that includes a standardized gene name and symbol for every known human gene it is organized by the h GNC or the gene nomenclature committee and we have several others here i won't go through the whole laundry list but human phenotype ontology is a vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities again the medical subject headings are used to index pubmed and sno-med CT and icd-10-cm are both used heavily in the clinical environment sno-med CT is used for problem lists and icd-10-cm is used heavily for billing terminology for reporting and morbidity statistics the MLS is updated twice a year the ontology selection in terms of which ontologies are incorporated into the you MLS it can kind of vary so all the clinical terminologies and code sets that are designated by the federal government as standards federal standards will be included in the u MLS and this is going to include ontology z' and vocabularies that are used in the consolidated health informatics initiative any of the HIPAA mandated terminologies and also the public health information network initiative terminologies but NLM also works with other organizations to incorporate kind of more local ontology so if a research group has developed an ontology for their specific application that maybe you know incorporated into the umls as well in terms of access this homepage at the National Library of Medicine which is part of the NIH again is going to be your best starting point that's where you're going to be able to download the files and also get at some training and documentation and engage with the user community we'll talk about this in a little bit more detail in just a minute but well I'll wait we'll get to the licensing in just a minute in terms of access options it's typically you would want to download and install this to relational database there is an installer that will help you do that you can also access you MLS content through an API and you can also if you just want to browse to get a better sense of how it works and what it is there are a few web-based apps that we've been looking at so far just as an intro today the medical source browser the semantic network browser and meta map again are all available online here's a quick description of some of the file types and what you will find in terms of how those relate to connection within the umls if you're going to do a local download you'll you'll use this installer called metamorphosis this will allow you to create load scripts to to pull subsets of the umls into your database or whatever application you're using so most people typically don't code against the whole umls because it can really slow your application down it can be very powerful to instead pull very specific subsets of the umls so an example of that for a local institution installation might be that you only want to look at vocabularies that are in the you MLS that are in a certain language or that are free to use or from a specific vocabulary like gene ontology or you only want to see sno-med CT or you only want to see mesh and then you can also subset a local download by semantic type so you could pull only terms that are clinical drugs or diseases and syndromes or bacterium etc in order to use the umls it is free of charge in that the National Library of Medicine does not charge you to access or use the umls but that being said you will be required to sign a license and you will be required to renew that license every year and just some of the basics recommend that if you're going to use it you use the license you read the license and the user agreements very carefully but overview is that there's no charge it is for individual use so there are no group or institutional licenses available some of the material some of the ontology Zand vocabularies are copyrighted and so there may be some specific there are specific restrictions on some of the individual vocabularies within the umls a good tool to help you kind of parse out which ones you may want to use in an application or not depending on their licensing there is this vocabulary documentation page each of the licenses are divided into nine categories so you can search by ontology vocabulary terminology or you can search by the category to determine which ontology is you may want to use that fit your fit your particular use case the best just a couple of quick examples category 0r are free to use and distribute so you could potentially build an application and use category 0 terms ontology z' within that application if you were using category 3 or some of the other categories there would be more strict limits in terms of how you could potentially distribute or or use that application more widely beyond just local research purposes and the kind of history behind the licensing is that when the UML s was first developed in the late 1980s it was very common for institutions to have licenses to ontology z' at the institutional level and the idea was that the UML s was software that would allow those different ontologies to talk to each other but institutions at that time were more likely to have an institutional agreement or a license that was low kind of more localized and more restricted to to local use at any rate we recommend that you review this pretty carefully and we're happy to I'm happy to consult with you or meet with you talk to you further about specific use cases in terms of how they relate to the licenses so with that I'll take any questions and thanks again for your time gosh that was painful [Music] yeah it'll work it will work well thank you again for pitching in and taking some time hi I appreciate it so it's
