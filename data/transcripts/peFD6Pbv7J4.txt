um I guess I'm introducing myself so thanks everyone for coming till they told me I do seminars series um this is the last seminar before we take a break for the summer um I have already started scheduling some people for the fall so if you're interested in giving a talk in the fall please email me it's always much easier when I get volunteers versus having to coerce people to talk since I dunno there some people are mine who are not usually at the seminar series and this is a seminar serious talk about new tools technologies methodology they're either newly developed recently developed or simply abused for a lot of researchers so I'm Marcy Brandenburg and the bio information is here and I'll be talking about ncbi resources I did get some backup today so we do have some NCBI staff remotely logged in so feel free to ask about questions if I can't answer them hopefully they can I'm also hoping they can maybe correct me if I say anything in crack so this seminar I really came out because I recently took a couple of classes to learn more about the ncbi resources and brian asked if I would give one of these seminars to talk about what I learned so there's all I'm not an expert I'm still sort of trying to process a lot of what I've learned which is why several of the NCBI staff graciously offered to are willing to log on so start by talking a little bit about the training classes that I took and then I'm gonna just sort of do it more like a survey of resources some of the resources that I've learned about and I've just sort of broken them into categories here I know some of these resources many of you are to be familiar with so I'm not gonna spend a long time on any one resource and for those that I think you're probably more familiar with I'm gonna try to point out some things that you may be less familiar with with those resources and then towards the end I'll just talk about what I hope to do in terms of library services in the future related to ncbi resources so two training courses and training courses I took responsive either National Library of Medicine the National Center for Biotechnology information and the national network of libraries in medicine and on training center these were specific for librarians and they were free courses for both of the courses that took you did have to apply their separate application processes and get accepted to attend the courses so the first two courses was titled fundamentals of bioinformatics and searching which Scott nicely took with me we took this in the fall of 2015 and it was a four-week long online course taught by Diane rein from the University of Buffalo she's a librarian there the goal of this course is to provide an introduction to buying from attics theory and practice in support of developing and implementing library based mathematics products and services this course covered basically molecular biology basics and an introduction to several of the NCBI databases and tools during these classes there was really for people to attend there was no expectation of having a biology background so they did do a lot to try to get those people up to speed in the format of this course were recorded lectures that we had to view articles that we had to read and then exercises that we had to do this course online course was a prerequisite for the librarians guide to NCBI which was a five-day in-person course held at the NIH last month and it was taught by NCBI staff and Diane rein the focus of this course was disorder to provide an overview of ncbi resources that are used to find molecular data and the format for this course was two modules per day each had a lecture component and then sort of a hands-on component and the hands-on component usually in system consisted of a demo that the instructor did with the attendees walking through it together and then some hands-on exercises that we were just sort of doing our own with them available to answer questions these are the topics that were covered in the librarians guide as you can see we covered advanced entree a sequences assemblies and genomes blast sequence variation gene expression structure and function drugs and small molecules and then some additional topics so I'll be briefly touching upon number of the resources that we covered in these various categories all right so I'm gonna start by talking about ncbi resources for genes and genomes and this of course will start with gene I know many of you in this room are very familiar with gene so I won't spend too much time on it um but gene which was formerly known as entre gene comers of course genes specific information it has genes for many species and it does contain unique identifiers that are used throughout many of the NCBI databases you can of course get a lot of very useful information from a gene record and get information about sequence expression structure function citation homology data and more this is just an example of the top of a gene record this is the record for estrogen receptor 1 for human I'm basically I just want to point out on the right hand side there's a nice table of contents this can give you a very quick idea the type of information that you can get from a gene record and will also link you to that particular area in each record so you know that you want a pathway information you can just click on that and I'll take you to that portion of the record there's a couple things I wanted to point out from a gene record of course you have the location the genomic context or the location of the gene on the chromosome and it will show you those genes the neighbor it - and then I also just want to make sure you where there's a bibliography section in the gene record so you can get articles in PubMed that are related to your particular gene of interest so it's really all I'm gonna talk about in terms of a gene record because again I know that most of you in this room are probably very familiar with the gene record or she yeah um could you back up for a second in the bibliography articles are those most recent first or those five presumably those are not curated in terms of those five being shown or I don't know the answer let's see online happens to know that I mean I know it'll link you to all of them so I would assume that those are the most recent the publication dates yeah they're out June 13 2014 okay yeah I'm not sure exactly how they do that Peter Chang will see he has got an answer to that so we can rate and see what the answer is of that they do link you of course to all the citations in PubMed but that's tree on the record there's only a few available quite how they do that I'll just read his response he felt proud of that order okay thank you Peter so that's really I'm going to talk about with the gene record so I want to focus on something you may be less familiar with and that is I'm ways to search gene and that would be field searching an index searching gene is actually a really great resource for doing field searching in so it's some great like field searches would be to search in the organism field so I have an example here at yeast and then organism and brackets following that so you put in the search box this is saying search for yeast specifically in the organism field oh another example would be there is an official gene symbol field so you could do field search for the official gene symbols I've got CFTR and then you just put symbol and brackets following your search term and that is saying search for this term basically it's the FTR specifically in the official gene symbol field certainly one of the best searches that you can do in gene if you know the official gene symbol that you're looking for and if you're looking for it in a particular species would be doing a combined search like I had down here so this would be CFTR symbol and an and is your boolean operator it does need to be capitalized and then you do your species so human and the organism field so basically what I'm saying and find all records then have CFTR specifically in the official gene symbol field and it also has to have human in the organism field and so if you do that correctly you should get one result it should be exactly what you're looking for I'm in addition to field searching yeah where can you go to find out where all the possible fields on and I believe that should be in the help documentation so it's probably the bookshop information for Jean there's usually like I know for PubMed there's a whole area for field searching but there's another way and actually I'll show you that right now you can sort of get that information from index searching too so index searching is available under advanced option which you can get you can access that underneath the search box and I'll show you that actually on the next slide and just some examples of what you can do under index searching or you can search for organism exon count chromosome it's there like exon account would be for example if you wanted a gene that particularly number of exons on it you could actually search by that so to show you a little bit about index searching you would access it from this advanced option underneath the search box and when you click on that you get to your search builder so here would be your fields marine so this would actually be the answer to your question you know this all feels drop down menu and if you expand it you get all the fields that are available in gene so I guess that would be the field information that doesn't necessarily tell you what you put in the brackets per se so that my guess is you need to get that from the help documentation in the URL or something like if you select one of these poems it'll actually this prevents you from actually having to do that field searches but knowing the brackets this is basically a way of doing it but not the bracket is yeah so you could choose like organism here put the organism in here is your blue operand for and and then you could choose the official gene symbol field put in there and it's the equivalent of doing that you're searching specifically in those fields and then it'll build the manual expression yeah in the search box at the top so you can see how whatever I would put it up here I guess that makes sense until you do index searching which is slightly different you could choose a field so for example organism and there are sort to examples that I'll explain one is say you searching out organism and you know the organism starts the name starts with H oh you're not quite sure the rest of the species how to spell it you could put the H o in the search box click show index list and what it would do is it would give you basically drop you right into the index of all the species in gene starting at that start with H oh but where you maybe even less familiar with is that you actually don't to put anything in that search box to do index searching so I could choose organism leave this search box empty and click show index list and when I do that I get the full index of species so of course it's much longer than the shows here but it's alphabetical it'll show you the number of parentheses is the number of records that are in gene for that organism per species um so this can be really useful say you want to know all the organisms that are indexed here say you're gonna do a number search like exon count or something and you're not really sure well how do you input a number if you write out the number do you put the digits do you need zeros before it you need a decimal point and zero it's afterwards if that's the case you're not really sure how to input it you could go do index searching and you'd see how it's actually indexed within the database ah so this is actually not only species that to get back it's all texting on the categories thank you Peter sorry that's explaining to that set index searching I didn't know about it before the class and I thought it was really useful and a good way to find out so how things are indexed and what information is actually in jeanne so moving away from gene I'll quickly talk about GenBank versus refseq and so both of these are annotated collections of publicly available DNA sequences and protein translations they both have sequence records that could include a single gene or be a complete genome across different organisms so how are they different well GenBank is where the researcher goes to submit their sequence GenBank record is exactly the information that the researcher submitted and it's annotated by the submitter so say a submitter goes in and you submit some information and you type it and wrong then the GenBank record is gonna have so as a result GenBank Records can have incomplete and incorrect information and records they can also have a done dn't record so you could have multiple people submitting the same sequence in which case you have multiple records for the same sequence graph seek and contrast is the reference standard so these are records that are annotated by NCBI they're updated by NCBI so as things change over time they can always be the most accurate and most up-to-date and they're non redundant so whenever possible you're gonna want to use the refseq record and not the GenBank record this is just the exception series for refseq in case you're interested um if it's a genomic sequence it'll start with n CA C or ng if it's mo na and are in a it will start with n N and our exome or XR and if it's a protein will start with n P and X P and so the each one does mean something different and I could tell you that but you could also just look that up so if anyone's interested I I do have that on my little cheat notes here so I could tell you but basically there are differences but these are the most important things right here um so all records that are in refseq also end up in either nucleotide or protein so in most instances you don't actually need to search refseq directly you could just search a nucleotide or protein so remind me what but the NX for example in the protein index is I'm predicted yeah yes exactly so NP is our protein associated with you know the nm or the NC accession numbers XP is a protein predictive model and it's the same thing actually with some of these others so like XM is a predicted model as is XR + + 1 would be mRNAs XM that's mrna as is this one the R is a non-coding RNA and for genomic the AC is a complete genomic model but usually an alternate assembly NC is also a complete dinero it molecule but it's usually reference assembly and ng is the ink complete genomic read any other questions about that so I just want to take a moment to mention the International nucleotide sequence database collaboration because I think it's a pretty neat collaboration and something that is relatively rare so if you are going to submit a sequence you can submit your sequence to one of three databases you can submit to GenBank from NCBI you could submit to the European nucleotide archive through EBI or you could submit to the DNA databank of Japan regardless of which of the three database you sub minute - it becomes searchable from all three so they actually have a collaboration saying basically regardless you know we're gonna share basically records so it doesn't matter which one you submit it to it'll become searchable and findable and all three so they've got sort of a neat collaboration and something you don't see very often or she does that mean that they share nomenclature in terms of exception and other numbers or our molecular entities re accession to fit the native system when they come in to say GenBank from m'boy DDGS ddbj so I'm guessing you can see which it was actually submitted to be my gas I can't say that I specifically looked but this is trooper yeah so see ya so Peter confirmed that each database has its own sort of set like being another online thing or we're waiting for that to come up I can move on to genome related databases which would be the next thing I'm talking about that NCBI has so I'm guessing that those are the okay and from thank you everyone online it's good thing I had backup help Peters Tiger or waiting for a PTO type I can start moving on to the jennette related databases and these are bio project genome assembly and biosample so I'm just gonna very quickly it's the only slide I think I have on this but try to sort of explain the relationship between these and sort of the differences so by a project is a collection of biological data it's related to a single initiative or project so this could be all the sort of information that came from a specific operation or consortium or a particular organization I'm gonna stop real quickly cuz Peter wrote something so the accession number is actually the same across all three of the databases they've shown that collaboration and if you want the information about that we have a nice link now that you guys could use to get that information thank you again so again so final project is sort of collecting all the information that sort of related because it's all from an organization or a collaboration or consortium within a bio project within a specific project basically maybe you have work that's being done in multiple species so genome collects whole genome information by species or organism so if that's the case you can have separate records for those organisms but they may all be attached to the same bio project assembly collects information about structure of assembled genomes and it will change track the changes that take place to those genomes and then biosample I think is more on the sample level so it collects descriptions of the source materials to the experimental pathways so I borrowed this image from when the slides of the courses you can see if my project is really sort of like the umbrella information it has all the information related to the project and then you know underneath that you sort of get genome and assembly and biosample it breaks it out into a different organization in detail I wanna make sure you're aware the NCBI is a genome remapping service so if you are working on a build of the genome and in the middle of your project a new build becomes available if you want to migrate over you can do so using their remapping service what this will do is it'll take the coordinates that you're using on the old build and it will remap them to the translate them I guess to the appropriate new coordinates on the new build I assume that there are they a hundred percent the same when they 99 percent the same if I lived over a genome with one versus the other I'm not familiar the coordinates on their tracks and stuff so I'm curious how consistent that is this a lot of people use that as well yeah I would assume they're fairly equivalent if not that would sort of concern me some regions that don't okay all right very good yeah it would be interesting then - no actually what percentage is I'm sure it's pretty close yeah I would assume so where else justify using one over the other they're not similar all right so I'm gonna move on to resources for sequence similarity and this is of course blast I'm so glass I'm sure most of you know stands for basic local alignment sequence tool it's actually blast to a number of years ago they redid the algorithm they renamed it to blast - but most people still call it blast blast of course find similar sequences to your query sequence when you do a blast search you could put the pull sequence or a portion of the sequence into on the search box but you could also just use an accession number if you knew what that number was I'll talk a little bit more about this but you may want to increase the maximum number of target sequences that you're going to get your last results the default is actually pretty small and so you may be missing important information if you don't increase that you can't save in Blast you are saving the search strategy though not the results I want to make sure you're aware of that um and because of course things are always changing if you run your blast search again say six months and now you may get very different results so just know that when you save it's just the strategy and not the results and the last thing on this slide is the URL I just got an email about this maybe a week ago if you're using blasts make sure that you're using the first URL blast NCBI NLM NIH gov in not using NCBI NLM the nih class starting in december i believe this latter URL will no longer work so if that's the one you're using you may want to change your bookmark or change which one you're in the habit of using so of course researchers use blasts to locate mutations and genetic variations to compare two or more sequences to find similar sequences from different organisms to identify protein domains locate 3d structure records and more so this is just so your basic protein blast search window so it's always a good idea to click the reset page button and also the clear button before you put in your sequence apparently there have been two the stories or people have not done that and they put in their sequence and they've run blast and they've gotten results but nothing to do with their sequence and they clear their cache and it still happened not really sure why that would be but that are safe and sorry it's a good habit to just automatically click these even if you haven't run your search anytime recently um so when you run a protein blast course you take a sequence such as the one the screen you put it in your search box or you could do the exception number and then you have a few choices you would choose which database you're gonna run blast against so the top one which is the one that is currently selected the non-redundant protein sequences or NR this is the most comprehensive of the databases and it actually many of the things below it so includes Swiss Pro and protein databank and GenBank and stuff there are some algorithms that you can choose from not really gonna go into this other than to say that blastp which is the protein protein glass that's the default and that's probably the most basic and most common algorithm to use if you want more information about the other algorithms there's this nice little question mark down here you can click on that and it'll explain the differences between the algorithms down at the bottom to the right of the blast button there's an option to check a box so that your results will show up in a new window this is always advisable so that you don't lose your search screen and you don't actually click out of your results like that and then lose everything and before you click the blast button you may want to look at the algorithm parameters which are at the bottom of the screen and if you expand that you get this window and there are a couple of things I want to point out here the first is that maximum target sequences so this is why I was talking about earlier you may want to increase this the default is 100 you may want to crease that to a thousand I think you may even be able increase it to 10,000 sure but 100 it's sort of low and I'm gonna show you in a minute ways to filter from your results so that you can narrow down your search so you may as well pull in more results initially and then filter from there to make sure you're not missing anything important the other thing I'll point out is a short queries option so the blast algorithm is meant to work on queries or sequences of a certain minimum length but you can actually run blast on shorter queries but if you do so you just need to make sure that this box is checked so that it will rework its algorithm appropriately so once you run your blast search you get some results one of the things you get is this descriptions table I just want mentioned the eval you you now you is the probability that you're hit or result is random the best score is 0 basically means it's not random a guy greater than 1 means that maybe random and a growl you rate greater than 10 means it's like one random the column to the left of you values a square discovery that is the percent of the sequence that it is exactly the same you also get some conserved domain information so the points of these mountains are where the conserved domains are located um although it's not in this example sometimes in this query sequence information you'll get some areas that have sort of a turquoise color if you get that that represents an area of low complexity and you get your distribution distribution of your blast hits Vista Falls to doing about a hundred hits there's away in the filtering options to actually increase this so keep in mind these are not necessarily all your results it's just doing a small number of them so you have you increase your results say I got thousand hits this might only show a portion of those because it's just quicker for the computer to compute you can see the color there's a color bar here all these are pretty well aligned but sometimes you'll see portions of the bars or full bars of different colors and if this were live I could take my mouse and scroll over each of these bars and the information up here would change to represent the bar that I'm currently on and that sequence so I want to talk about formatting options on your glass results page at the top you have some options one of which is formatting options and if you click on that it'll give you this information this is a way basically to filter your result set to get more specific results for information um so one thing which I'll talk about the next size you can change the alignment view but you can also do some things again to sort of filter say you want only results of a particular line length or only a particular organism you could filter that here instead of doing it early on or you can exclude an organism say you only want results that had a specific percentage identity match with your query sequence well you could do a minimum and maximum here so this is really great and apparently a lot of people are not familiar with this and don't know this is here so once you have your long list of results this can help you narrow down to exactly what you want so I want to talk about the alignment view so the default view is pairwise what looks like this if we look at these first three rows at the top the first row is our query sequence the third row is our subject or our results basically sequence the middle row is telling us whether or not they align I find this very hard to read I feel like you have to look at it really closely to see where it's aligned and where it's not but you can change this view so one example there's several different musical change it to but one is called pairwise with dots for identities so here this top line again is my query sequence the bottom lines and I subject a result if it's got a dot in the result that means it's aligned with your query if it's not aligned it shows you the difference and it's in red so I find this much easier to read so I want you make sure you're aware there are different ways that you could change this so you don't have to necessarily look at this in my opinion more difficult view to see the alignment alright so last thing I want to say about Blas is if you use blast you do need to cite it so you should be citing this 1990 article if you use last for your work probably eight million well we hope a gazillion because we hope that people are you think blast a kid alright so I'm gonna move on to gene expression which of course is geo geo is the gene expression omnibus and it is the data repository that has array and sequence data I'm Sergio has geo dataset and it has geo profiles so geo data set is curated and it includes what's called a series entry at samples entry and a platform venture and I'll talk more about those on the next slide I want to make sure that you are aware that geo dataset only has a ray data there's no RNA seek data and geo dataset and geo profiles and that consists of the expression measurements for an individual gene across all of the samples in a geo dataset so geo is Miami compliant that is a requirement of many journals so if you have that requirement you can submit to do and it will meet that need when you you're gonna submit general information about what the study is so what you did why you did it how you did it all that information goes into what is called a series record you will also submit sample specifics and the data that you obtain that information goes into what is called a sample record and then you will also submit information about the array and that goes into us called a platform record and all of these can make up a geo data set record there are more series records than there are data set records because when you submit information it's a series record remember the Geo data set records are curated and so curation of course always Falls a little behind since it takes time to do that um so here's an example I searched for GSC for 5 to 3 in geo data sets even though I searched basically 1 accession number I got 9 results and you might be wondering why did you get 9 results when you did such a specific search well that breakdowns on the left-hand side one of these a data set record one's a series record 6 or sample records and one or platform record all related to that same accession and so I'll call it um this top result I believe is the data set record and you can see right here and the information it gives you the information from the platform the series record and it tells you right there there are six samples and it links out to geo profiles too so if you need the individual expression information you can access it there alright so we're moving on to protein structure yes wearing back yes so um geo used to have this really nice query page where you can carry a third difference and I can't find that page anymore I always skip to this one yes either so maybe someone NCBI can help let us know if that whatever but yeah I found the same thing because every time I did a search that basically dropped me into geo data sets it's it helps you you can probably do everything here that you could do there except you have to know what you're doing yeah there's a browser link from the g1 page but also just browsing data sets as far as I know so I have experienced the same thing I don't know if that removal of the other one is a permanent removal or not well I'm talking we can see if anybody decides to respond we may not have any may not have any Jew experts on line two you have typing at the moment it's a very good question that is one thing about NCBI I think it would constantly changing trying for the better but it looks like they integrate you and so are you referring to the former limits page look why talk about the same yeah it's like if I googled geo that used to be the main page three different box like the computer search for a series so you find the new page it sounds like more complicated than the old one or less user-friendly yeah okay that's always good feedback available then maybe I was there in a transition period well while Peter is typing I will cigarette so it looks like that's the replacement page yeah all right so move on to protein structure so structures do not get submitted to NCBI they get into the protein databank and then they become searchable or their records end up in structure and protein so down at the bottom I have the top of a record in structure I do want to point out that on the right hand side they do have information here for when it was deposited in the PDB the experimental method and some other just useful information right there at the top if you scroll further down in the record you will get to a box that looks like this and this is how you would view it the structure in 3d so NCBI has 3d viewing software called Stan 3d which I'll talk about in the next few slides this is a software that used to be downloaded installed on your computer so you don't already have it downloaded if you do already have it on your computer and then you click view structure it will launch the software on your computer with the structure for the particular structure in that record that you wanted you so exactly what is see in 3d it is again and to be a software to view 3d structure it works with Windows and a Mac and it can be compiled in UNIX it shows you the structure sequence information and alignment information you can create in our teachings and if I remember correctly I think you can actually view them on the image and you can change visual properties although I won't be I'm showing you that today since I'm just going to go through everything really quickly and you can also export the image as a PNG file so this is a structure in 3d of course that this was live I could use my mouse and change the orientation of this and move it around and zoom in and out I'm guessing Barry's this sort of standard like the cylinders represent alpha-helix sees it is yeah so I figured that was standard cylinders aren't real they represent alpha kilo seize the spaghetti stuff this backbone spaghetti looks messed up so you get your sequence alignment be right down this screenshot was taken on a PC so in a PC you have separate menu bars for these two windows apparently in the Mac it's one menu bar so you have to be very careful about which one you're actually clicked on at that time there are different views you can view so the worms is default it's actually the least accurate but it's the easiest for the cursor is a drop so it is the default but you can change it by going in the style menu rendering shortcuts and then you can choose from these options so this is actually space so what you can see looks very different from the worms which was what was here and the last thing I'll mention is that you can select a portion of the sequence and the sequence viewer so here what's in yellow I selected that and it will map that and select it in the actual 3d image all right so move on to small molecules let's there any questions about that alright so this is a course of pubchem there's pubchem substance pubchem bioassay and pubchem compound i always found this extremely confusing and never understood the difference until i think they attended this class so pubchem substance has substances of known or unknown composition it has real chemicals it also has some very odd things like chamomile tea or someone hydrolyzed a feather and then submitted it to substance Pope Ken bioassay has experimental information that's related to the chemical substance now in contrast Pupkin compound is information that comes from substance but is curated and annotated by ncbi and they've also added a number of valuable internal external links to those records so again when possible you want to use compound it's also me the most up-to-date so if a compound chemical changes name or something changes in it it'll all be updated here so just to make certain now GIC Pupkin compound as being the pubchem substance genbank as referent refseq is to GenBank so when you submit to pubchem you must sign an agreement saying that anyone can freely use your data so you should know that I'm pubchem is continuously updated so if you submit a chemical and you would say make this available it will usually you should see it within one to two days so this is just the top of a pubchem record PopCap records compound records I can get very long there's a table of contents on the left hand side portion of it but again it can like you to particular parts of the record that you're interested in okay does have a limits options so if used PubMed you may have noticed if you used to use the limits option it's no longer there now there's a refine search option down the left-hand side well in pubchem limits does still exist and it is going to continue to exist as far as I know for the foreseeable future so that some things that you can do with the limits you could limit to chemical properties such as chemicals that particular molecular weight particular stereochemistry you can even limit to particular elements if you want to make sure they're included um pubchem is supposedly actually one of the best documented resources in pub and NCBI so if you have questions I recommend looking at their documentation the last thing I mentioned this slide is these sort a cons up at the top right so some of those are for downloading information but I want to point out is the structure search tool which is second from the left and if you click on that it'll take you to the chemical structure similarity tool and this is where you can go to search on a structure for similar structures so R example I have here a chemical ID I click the edit button and it takes me to this sketch or window so at this point I could edit the structure and then search on the new structure that I created or you could actually get a blank canvas here and dry your structure so say you had an unknown structure and you didn't know what it was you wanted to find out you can maybe draw the structure here you these nice tools over to the left and then search against the known structures and come up with try figure out what it is all right so I'm gonna move on to additional resources these are just a few additional things that I thought are worth telling you about so one is by Iain CV this is pretty cool so if you have an ER a Commons account and those of you in this room know who you are because that's a system that you used to manage all your grants you can link that to my NCBI which I'm guessing all of you have cyan CDs in my NCBI this stands for science experts network curriculum vitae and their hope is to eventually make this a federally wide biosketch repository so that you can have all your information in one place and then regardless of which federal agency you are submitting your grant to you'd be able to get your biosketch in the right format using this system right now however the only output is your nih biosketch this is very new this just came out a week or two ago you can now create multiple profiles so say you had multiple NIH grants and the NIH biosketches were slightly different you could save them as multiple profiles the input for this is orchid if you have that you know about it it's a unique identifier to help disambiguate authors so if you have an orchid ID you could use that as some of the input you can input information in your er a comments account and also in your my bibliography information all of that goes in you can also manually add information and then the output is the nih biosketch so this is what it looks like I went into my NCBI to the side incb and so you can see right now I haven't put any information in this example but you can see the normal breakdown your education training information your personal statement positions and honors and then the top right you can download in the correct format is a PDF or XML this is a very recent change I'm up to just about a week or two ago is only a PDF but this is very useful so I went in after doing this I added some of my information just to see what it would look like a download as a PDF and this I got imperfect nih biosketch formatting as someone who worked on this stuff for the bd2k grant I highly recommend doing this you will hopefully make the lives of your administration people so much so I actually know this was really cool and would have been really helpful for me to know about when I submitted mine for the bd2k support the word the ability to save it as yeah as I say I mean Helen I'm sure will want it and word so they just add that in I think that's gonna be key experience yeah so I thought this was really cool I actually didn't know about this before the class and so I want to make sure everyone was aware of that I also want to make sure you're aware that NCBI is a submission portal so this is a really good URL to just keep in mind it's submit NCBI NLM NIH gov so this will link you basically to all the various submission locations so you can see Jen big geo NIMS that's where you go to submit your NIH manuscripts to be compliant with the public access policy I'm saying this is sort of like one-stop shopping here if you do a lot of submissions for NIH stuff they have a new entre search just came out since I returned from the class this is also known as G query and now it just says search NCBI databases basically this is just how you do the federated search so that you would be searching in one place so here I've searched for CFTR and it searched it across all of the NCBI databases and will tell me how many results I would get in each one I think this new interface is much cleaner and I like it much better than the old one so I want to make sure you're aware that that had changed in case you were staying away from it because he didn't like the old interface and the last thing I want to talk about is PubMed Commons only because if you've been going into PubMed you may have seen this and maybe like what on earth is this so this is your normal PubMed home now and on the right-hand side here you'll see that now says PubMed Commons so you might be wondering what that is I'm so PubMed Commons is basically a commenting system it allows authors to share opinions and comments on scientific publications that are in PubMed you do have to use your name if you leave a comment so that's one way that they've tried to use to try to try to help ensure that people are gonna write legitimate information and they are in comments any author that has a publication in PubMed can leave a comment there is at this time don't monitoring because NCBI does not the staff for that but there is a report abuse link so if you do find something I'm one of your articles that is inappropriate you can click that and you can get it removed they say there's a publication so how is that linked and how does that affect if you have more author names on different publications and is this incorporating my forged ID or anything like that I don't think it is like bills already on some papers and I'm bills are on a couple of others and I mean I guess well so you do want to create an account yeah I think so I heard this strange on the next page you have to join PubMed Commons so I'm guessing when you do that maybe you are I haven't tried it actually so I don't know I guess I should have tried that before coming here this wasn't it this was a beta test for awhile I think because I know I tried to do it before it was like select access okay I know that parently they've been surprised by the number of people I think that have actually been doing it if you do have problem anyone or you're not an author and you're interested I may be able to help you get access to that but yeah so I don't know the exact answer but I'm guessing that when you go through this process you're probably identifying yourself and maybe your papers so and my other question I guess is there are any of these systems incorporating orchid IDs I know there's a push here at Michigan beginning yeah so I think we're gonna need maybe in PubMed now it's certainly in sciencv you can use your input and link it up there I actually did that with mine I went logged into orchid ID so more and more these systems certainly are and I know they are trying to tie more stuff to orchid I do it seems they're picking up a lot of steam right now so I think it's a really good resource and I think you can use it I know that well appreciate Scopus has it and they are because that's also beer so I know more and more the databases are sarnath incorporate it we go back to the cider quickly so as of right now authors are not notified when a comment is left on an article and that is a feature that they would like to add in the future but as of right now you were just have to go check your articles if you want to see if anyone's commented there are guidelines if you're going to use PubMed Commons and the one that I want to point out right now is that comments can be freely used by anyone so keep that in mind if you're gonna make comments um so this is yeah to join in order to see if No so this is a standard record now I just went to PubMed found this article here's your normal information your abjectly below that now it's a PubMed Commons and you can see the comment right there there's so then can you search for most competent set of I comments they're searchable that's actually really good question I don't think they are at this time at least mmm there was a comment made in the chat right so you have to be an author to be the comment yeah so basically the PubMed Commons those comments that are made are publicly viewable to anybody you just go to PubMed so you could look up your article go to the record and you'll see is there any comments there I know cuz I checked my articles so lastly I'll talk about library services and this is really just a slide so now that I took these courses I'm learning a little bit more about the ncbi resources I do hope to teach on some of them and I would certainly be interested to know which of these you think would be a most value for me to offer training sessions on I also of course hope job for some consultation so one on one things or small group things if someone has some data or is not sure which resource they should use or something that to sit down with them and talk that through and also answer basic questions I have a nice in now at the NCBI group and there's a nice list sir - actually that with graduates and liqueurs and the NCBI staff so if I can't answer a question I can submit it there and might be able to get help from NCBI or other librarians who may have more experience I'm gonna come back to this resources would be a most value to teach but I'll just finish me my slides this is just a photo of all of us who attended the course and the end and the instructors I'm in from the National Library Medicine and I would like to acknowledge and thank all of the instructors particularly those who are currently online right now more question they thank you and I would also like to come back like I said if anyone has a suggestion just from your experience a knowledge of what research do you think would be most valuable to have training on here I would love to hear that oh you can't search comments in PubMed Thank You Marissa so that's yeah so that would be the field looks like that searches for presence of comments and not in the text of comments but that's a useful thing to know search with a search with your author name and then has user comments and find whatever whatever articles of yours there are have been commented that yeah comments are yeah so you're not actually searching the comment here to search them oh yeah so if I was an author I would save a search in PubMed that was my name or my orchid ID or whatever with that and then if you can order them by last commented on that would be a cool search to come and pull out occasionally to see what you've got [Music] [Music] [Music]
