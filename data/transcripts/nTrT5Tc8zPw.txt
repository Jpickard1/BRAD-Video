I guess you covered all of it really good so as you said I'm I'm Josh I'm representing the Michigan eye gem teams and title of our talk is synthetic biology in the iGEM competition so the first thing I'm pretty sure a lot of you like to know is what is synthetic biology right well I'll cover that first and then we'll talk about the competitions that we participate in and then I'll mention what Michigan teams have done especially this year so back biology uses much of the same techniques and equipment of the biological sciences but instead of research and new discoveries and that biologists looked to co-opt and improve upon genetic blueprints of existing organisms to design and create new novel biological devices to systems so it's it's more of an engineering field count it's also probably noticed genetic engineering it's less pop it's less it's also it's also go to genetic modification so what basically what how it works is in general is you have several genes that that that you'd like from one reason or another and you take parts of each gene and use you combine them into a composite gene it you can do this and you generally do this several times and create several composite genes these composite teams you insert into a biological system and create a synthetic system these the system can be in vitro it can be in a virus it can be in bacteria you can be even used to be in eukaryotic cells million cells some examples are most most of them sell now has just produced through synthetic of bacteria systems recently there were the there was I don't know the people have seen the Henry Ford commercial where people were able to genetically engineer a patient to cure her cancer so gene therapy was a form of synthetic biology they were able to reengineer her immune system to recognize the cancer so IgM is is founded by some of the founders of synthetic biology it's as Jim said it stands for International a genetically engineered machine and and mainly mainly runs the competition the competition involves teams creating open source projects relating to different aspects of synthetic biology so one of the key aspects of the competition is everything in it is open source none of it can be patented all of it has to be submitted for future teams and for general general public to use there's some standards there yes there's like so that's the other key component of the competition is that the the things that you submit um have to meet certain standards and/or get the come up with your own standard these are called biobrick standards so the DNA the DNA is actually standardized so that people who several several different teams that followed the same standard are actually compatible with each other and future teams can actually combine these these these projects of past teams module early to create new projects so this this competition is an international competition it was started by MIT in 2004 its branched off of MIT since then in 2012 now it's all nonprofit organization these competition ends in a fall conference called the Jamboree and so what is this Lotus Jamboree well it's it's it's kind of your standard conference except everyone's a student and they're all undergrads or masters students and haven't seen any postdocs but of course there's also advisors faculty who show up so there's a presentation there's a micro presenter Christine and handsome devil over there and there's a poster session and then there's social events so the the competitions actually now split into three divisions there's the high school division which is strictly for teams associated with high schools then there's the undergrad division which is separated from the overgrad division by whether or not your team has has has someone over 23 or not it's it's kind of an arbitrary breakdown but it allows sort of even the playing field or they think it allows it even the playing field between Europe in the United States where the education is different and the distinction between masters and undergrad is blurred so I I mean I actually think that the undergrad team that won this year could have kicked over grad teams but they're trying to make it there so the the each division is split into tracks there is now 15 tracks use our energy environment Putin to foundational advanced health and medicine information processing manufacturing new application are in design community labs entrepreneurship measurement microphone expulse iam practices and software ok so you have these had grown the number of tracks at Rome there's a separate community for every one of us it's not necessarily separate community it's it's sort of like separates their separate groupings so they'd like to have all the energy presentations together like they have all the environment presentations together like all the software presentations were all in a row on the same day at the conference so this year there was 243 teams yeah so thousands of people from all over the 180 200 or 2300 attendees in the heights Convention Center Boston all undergrad or over greater that isn't even a high school and next next for the oh it's rich mixture there was bringing in the high school soon so all this stuff about data big data they design well there's always been the the the data base storing the information of the bail out the the synthetic parts the the projects from from past years called the registry of parts so the collection of that data and the making that data accessible to future team does up is is something they've improved a lot of Hondas are still working on its the that the software division was one of the earliest tracks sophomore track was one the earliest tracks to emerge in the competition and separate from the normal laboratory tracks and a lot of a lot of the projects that they come out of that that track deal a lot with handling databases handling the the synthetic biological parts information and data as you can see as you'll see the competitions very open-ended it's sort of like a judge science fair so the idea is basically they give you some criteria but it's it's not incredibly restrictive and the just basically trying to impress the judges at the end of the day so what distinguishes the software category from information processing is information processing more like genetic computing or yeah so information processing track is more basically doing computations generally speaking in in a biological system so the Michigan team in the past sexually done very well doing you know doing a probation processing project creating a biological bit in in out of out of DNA so be being able to store and manipulate information in DNA easily was the goal of our product in 2012 in 2013 which is much more stable than an information sort in in in associate associated proteins which is how a lot of people currently do it and we did we did very well those two years uh I could I can go into that a little bit more later so at the at the end of the competition there's a top three for each division so out in Boston in at the end of October there was top three undergrad top three over grad and the high school students at their at their conference had a top three then there's metals which are not what you really think normally of as metals there's sort of like criteria levels so lots of teams can get bronze lots of teams can get silver lots of teams the cool I think it's it it's meant to recognize level of compliance with the philosophy of the organization and achievement of course and then so there's also track Awards so the best software project gets an award the best policy and practices gets a get to the ward the best Art and Design as an award and there's non track awards like best poster best presentation best new biological part is an award and so I did now transition to the the bulk of the presentation about what Michigan teams have done in the past so Michigan join the competition in 2006 it's it was very different back then there was like five faculty advisors and a handful of students it's now complete pretty much completely student-run we have faculty advisors but they're really just advisors we we get we get the weekly our funding we decide we create a budget we decide how to spend it we teach each other how to do everything it's we student students operate at every level of of the laboratory and software management so it's is it this would have a home base here at units and one of the engineers biomedical engineering earn so passed it's mainly been housed in it's mainly built for a mice mainly been primarily sponsored by MC to be in Nelson a now that we have two teams the we're now sponsored by this department and Arnaz OH so one team is sponsored by EMC to be one team sponsored by bioinformatics and the vice president for research yes but our official are officially our official sponsor is bioinformatics so in order in order to get so the the the official sponsor status is mainly something that assuming groups established with the University in order to use proprietor things like the black M and to have nonprofit status so we so we really just choose one department and and fill out paperwork I guess you could do multiple departments but it all I really need is one so past past tracks that we participated in include foundational advanced environment so this year we had to we had two teams we start this is the first year we had two teams the there was the there was one team that participated in the health and medicine tract and then our new team participated in the sophomore track and so the software software track is a lot different than the other tracks that no lab work is really required for that track the goal of the track is really to develop tools for for a synthetic biology even biological research so you see projects involving modeling you'd see project involving DNA sequence analysis and annotation you see probably prediction software involved in automating protocol critically creation of protocol for her for four deep per person for synthesizing new biological parts and so I I was mainly going to talk about what what software we developed this year as our first year sophomore team so any questions before I delve into that oh I think little history help will help understand our current or current project I've actually been on in I gem for quite a few years on the lab team I've done a lot of lab work and and know what work have a lot of experience of what works and what doesn't work and what really causes a struggle and a lot of times and but in the lab it'll seem just like that biology stops working for like a week two weeks a month and and that's when really start scrambling for for new ways of doing things and to get things especially when you have a one-year deadline for your project and so what we what you usually do is you start asking people you start going to people who do this stuff for years and years and years and you ask them how do you usually do this and sometimes that works and sometimes you can't replicate what they tell you to do and when all else fails you read the manual so usually every every lab procedure every reagent that you buy comes with a protocol to use and so with you you usually try and follow the instructions and hopefully it works however this is not always the case a lot of times the the protocols the procedures that are given to you are for ideal conditions are basically basically run through their marketing department to to basically cover their asses and they prevent people from suing them so when that doesn't work we go online and there's websites like open what word org and you go through different forms try and figure out how other people did this what problems they had whether they did whether they do to fix it but sometimes even Daniel encounter a problem that nobody's really solved or nobody's really shared how they solved it occasionally you'll find protocol-specific websites or pages that will have software associated with them like there's one one protocol that that a lot of people struggle with a lot is called a ligation and one thing we found when we were having trouble with this was a ligation calculator this this basically reagent calculator was actually created by an IBM team from Cambridge in 2010 and we this is one of the the resources we we use to try and and fix our problems with with this specific procedure so we took all these all these different attempted solutions all these different things we tried I tried to go and we've tried to compile them in past past lab years and so this is just a Google spreadsheet that I created to keep track of of what I tried for for various ligations and what worked and what didn't work so the RET so things that we that failed just worked off in red things that we were currently attempting were in yellow things that we just gave up on world white and there were supposed to be some some things that worked that we'd put in green but you see that that was not meant to be this is fascinating actually you know I think many of you know that I don't chair it thank God that I sit in on the IT executive committee for the health system you know every month we have to look at something like this and I guarantee you that you know they'll put most of them will be green and a few of them the yellow maybe one will be red which is one that they want to kill off anyway you know they expect you to believe and you know sixty percent of IT projects fail I mean you know that's that's right out of the McKinsey report and so you know yeah down at the bottom so this is so this is 2013 restriction enzymes uh so yeah manufacturers not nearly as good as other ones my favorite parameters the physical chemist and temperature your yeah down use polyethylene glycol sometimes yeah I could be public and also work so anyway we're getting the idea so part of part of the the bio work standard part of the synthetic biology standards of item are the restriction enzymes that that are used in in in these in these cloning operations so the a lot of these enzymes are were picked originally for their their efficacy and for their specific properties like temperature temperature sensitivity and things like that and so there's a lot of well things Greatbatch there today yeah so some of those variables some of those variables have been reduced by by by the biobrick standards this is what I was getting they actually we ordered the DNA so as part of it as part of your your team registration fee you get access to all all the submitted DNA parts from from all and so you can you can't you just put in a request for a certain DNA sequence and they send it to you in a week by registration a lot of people were sort of from City NCBI sorry any be any be sorry exactly to do with what the software that we came up with but anyways in 2013 we we had this issue and all of us including myself just gave up we just stopped doing work nothing was working we couldn't continue and we just had to basically settle for what we had at that point so this year this year this past year we what would I and and some others decide to do was form a software team and trying to just address problem from a using more advanced approach than what you saw previously were just basically just a spreadsheet and so you might tell me my no battle your department a couple of us for her from from the lab team in the previous year and then we recruited a few others from a variety of different backgrounds to come together learn how to do software learn learn how to learn how to program to how to create to create HTML interfaces and try to address this issue so one thing we did at the beginning of our projects we started looking in the literature or well whether what what what how much this problem had been studied already and one of the papers we found was this in in pure J it's an online journal studying the some of the problems with with reproducing known protocols that were published in in well-known papers Farsi make sure to send us around everybody this reference yeah I can I can go insure this this is this is we all need to pay attention to those yeah Josh sure you can send me in that PowerPoint second okay and so one of the things that it I found was that almost 50 percent of time the results from these well established papers were not reproducible and these are in well-known papers like cell nature science like those are the worst yeah yeah well see this is when it started you wrote this kind of focused on more clinical research you know and Jen and J&J did some internal studies and then that got out and then you know now we're looking at more broadly into the basic sciences and you know the numbers nature's cell science you know in the J&J at Amgen studies were approaching 75% of the studies could not near me yeah and so yeah this is there's been big time conference at the NIH Thomas wanted the directions level and I think it I mean it's a big threat to I think just the credibility of scientists this is under - this has the potential to undermine you know how we do you know promotion tenure you know trying to figure out you know and there could be some neat studies that you can do is you know somebody somebody publishes a result somebody famous some famous lab publishes a resolve and all these other labs climb onto it and you can make a citation tree and you know so they you know there's that kind of thing - yeah yeah and I think maybe one the reasons why nature science cell are so bad is cuz people don't bother to check because they think it's oh it's nature it's all like I don't need to check that it's good some other things written about this the whole hyper competition thing for an example you know the pressure on all you know from grad students on up to full professors to keep their CDs current we've been you know everything's being made visible on the internet I mean we've been struggling there for the faculty turns out that our CDs are all having to be encoded into NCBI right now format and other loaded on NCBI and linked out to Orkut you know it's a different game so this is great that you're bringing this up job yeah and one of the things that it found was in in several cases the actual what it what the the specifics of what a paper actually did of their protocol was actually completely indecipherable so could not be could not be identified at all and so what you see here are dip are different are different aspects of a protocols in the biological sciences a lot of protocols use antibodies or such as excel line or car strucked knockdown reagents the organism and in different biological fields this is how often you could actually identify the correct the correct one on average it's it's fairly over 50% oh yeah it's getting that is that magic number in there which is random distribution yeah I mean some so in some things it's it's worse than others but it's still pretty dismal especially for let's suppose it's supposed to be a hard science interesting how that sell-on stuff is pretty understandable why that would yeah you think like immunology would be better at its antibody reporting so so this this problem is is has been well has been has been established before and what we are what we hypothesized is that this problem is caused by a combination of factors as well for documentation like you saw in the previous slide difficult to find or difficult to access relevant information and lack of validation sort of like a peer review lack of replication right and the documentation is on which version of the software what data where on the whole line so yeah so this does play into the data science thing and I think and I think so does this the solution so we we decided to do some part of the competition is an emphasis on outreach as an emphasis on what they call human practices or policy and practices and so there's actually an award for that and we we did well actually just for our own purposes we decided to reach out to the scientific community to to professional labs to industrial labs to two other IgM teams to find out what what their experience with this problem was so we sent out a survey to undergraduates graduate students professional scientists we have one software guy in there and I think we got we're it so far we were able to get around 60 response responses of the survey is still on on our I gem website for people for people to take so we're all hoping to get more survey results we asked how often they were having problems with replication and nobody was perfect nobody being record on this and most people had problems over 25 percent of time up to 50 percent of the time and a significant proportion had had a problem the vast majority of the time we we want more detail as to exactly what was causing this problem and so we asked oh what people having trouble with just lack of specificity and clarity it was a major one or just complete omissions were the main problem these results are also are also available on our item website so we also got feedback as to what people would like to see in a solution the we offered several suggestions and we got some some more beyond that but mainly people wanted to be able to to compile and and and browse through a collection of protocols which they could contribute to and most importantly be able to review and comment and answer and give feedback for for their own protocols for other people's protocols so I said that the number of respondents is 66 is I mean down on the bottom I mean how many people actually oh yeah yeah yeah down the bottom is it's the number of the number of people who wanted to who wanted this feature so people could select multiple features and the most commonly selected one who was was able to to browse and uh this is if a question we asked was what features would you use so some people didn't feel like they would use a certain feature they wouldn't select that one you know so we also using this information we set out to create a solution and we decided to call that solution forget so what is proto cat or cat is a protocol catalog that's what it stands for and the idea is to crowdsource a registry and review system for for lab procedures and what we figured was on our own we're only able to create this spreadsheet with a limited number of trials and we did lots of trials but it wasn't enough so we needed more manpower and figured the best way to do that was the crowdsource did the problem and so we set up we set out to do this we could by considering several different programming languages several different in supplement packages for those for those languages and we settled on that we settled on a system where we we would we would post we put proto cat on a server which the code for witches on github and and scientists and and and general readers would access the entries on the server and be able to be able to collect all the information in one central location so some software has has that there has the people maintain their own basically version of databases on the on their own machine such as the annotation software called ape but in order to eliminate a complex confusion between people's different versions we wanted to keep it all in one central location and so we thought the best way to do that was using a Python package called Jenga it was recommended to to us and we decided that we'd all learn learn this language learn Python and learn how to use the specific package so of course lots of us came from different different reporter and background so most new Python somos students so there was a lot of learning that went into into this what Django is is it's a Python library this library simplifies the the the the generation of web pages from from a database and and it allowed first-time programmers like a lot of us to to do this more usually or simply this is open source that would allow future programmers to to add on to the software more easily so what we're where did we get to at this point we we this is the home page that of the curve protic hat there's there's also like the catalog and an account system that we set up of course there's like our contact information and whatnot it's got a pretty simple basic entry entry method at this point basically it's the protocol is just contained in a text box for now once you enter the the protocol it's it's you can you can browse the existing ones in in a list and wait and you can select the the protocol and then read its contents like a basic web page at the bottom of every protocol the the owner can delete it or post a comment well no anyone can post a comment and every every every entry has its own web page so you can link to it from other sites so when we came up with when we start out with this project we had a lot of ideas for things we want to implement a lot of ideas and so we have a lot of ideas for what we want to implement in the future if we have the chance to work on this in the future want to informaton do you think deleting yes I'm not sure I do the tracks how things have changed [Applause] well for now the information in there that might be what yeah that's right so one thing I was suggested that we that we definitely want to introduce of some kind of version control so that so that people can edit the deletion system is currently uh what's allowing people to edit the their mistakes they make when they entered in the end or something and but being able to to go back and see how a protocol has improved or how what someone said was the right way to do thinking and now saying something different so in terms of that I agree currently that that's that's the main method of correcting protocols but considering that the purpose of this is for replication if someone were to do something and refer to the protocol on a particular page and that someone goes back and edits it or deletes it it's no longer the same protocol so I think the versioning is that sort of system is almost paramount for this to be effective just because you need to be able to trace back and said well we use this protocol if you use the exact same protocol then you'll be able to reproach yep absolutely and so we're done we've been thinking hard about about how to implement that kind of birth control and we're still not simple pretty like a page similar to will be having Wikipedia which can serve the same as the common system I'm sorry question so I'd like a challenge when are your assumptions here what if in these unreplicated all protocols there is a variable the person is not aware of for example simple things like temperature or that they're distilled water somehow has something else in iron or something causes it to work or not and so how do you deal with that I mean so yeah so we were thinking is that for for for verbal that people miss we're hoping that that the review system would be able to to catch things like that and people would and people who figured figured out that there was that variable would comment and say you got you got you got to take this into account and make a new version of this protocol we're the from the outs of the idea what the the idea it starting from last year was keep to try keep track of as many variables as we could and and try and keep track of which which values for each parameter worked which ones were just not important etc right and so forth and so we would we'd like to implement a Search Search function a rating system so that people can can sort protocols by it can filter out the bad ones when the good ones not going through all the comments other types of filters like by category would would be would be also be nice yeah we also don't think the current input system is adequate at all we'd like to have something more sophisticated where maybe the protocol is broken into entry of steps and maybe even have separate entry of the amount of time it takes each step takes and just more sophisticated breakdown of what exactly a protocol is would be nice to see we also like to people be able to get the users and be able to maybe even review the users and say like this person is is really good or this person is is just filling up space on this database and your everything they know that so similar to what what you said before we'd like to one of the reasons why we chose Python and was so that we could implement calculations within the protocols and the I think what we accomplished this year and what we set out to do was create a foundation for all these advanced features so although what we have at this point is pretty basic what it what it has built the foundation for is can be very advanced and so we'd like to pour variable for variables like temperature like concentration like volume like like buffer buffer concentration it's like that we'd like to have allow for variations between different people between different instances of the protocols so that in the same protocol page you could say I want I want a leader a leader of product and what I want or I want a five molar concentration product and it would tell you they need to add this this this this and this amounts in order to get this product instead of people having to go to several different pages to see the one leader version that the two liter version of the five micro liter version and so now that was one of our main ideas from the beginning one cool idea we also had it's actually suggested to us from our lab team was to have sort of a in a timing system sort of like a cooking show where you could push it you could push play and it would tell you at this time okay you need to go back in and and start this next step right now or else you're or else your new gel is going to run off her or something like that so sort of making baking yeah and so right now this right now it's currently hosted locally just on a development server and we wanted to get it on a global server by the end of the year but we ran into some difficulty with that so we'd like to one of the first things we'd like to do next is to get it on a global server and get it hosted on a permanent global server maybe even by eye gem itself we'd also even though we want this to be centrally located in case of people want to work offline and what we'd like to be able to give them the option of downloading multiple protocols maybe maybe even the entire database you know especially if they don't want to they want to make changes don't want everybody to see the changes that while they're still working on it we'd also like to have like vendor information so like if it tells you you need these using this much of each reagent they can have the information to go and buy those reagents and maybe even maybe even be able to purchase them directly through the software we're hoping we can actually get sponsorship through that that means maybe have like little ads and so in order for this whole thing to work yet a protocol sharing peer review community has to be has to be cultivated if it's just if it's just a few people on our item team doing this it's pointless the view just like just like the item competition itself you know it only you know only really has an effect if everyone if if everyone actually wants to use it actually uses it actually contributes to it and gives feedback in terms of the future of our of our of our team and our club we've definitely to increase the search our survey size because 60 is is maybe fine for a first for first attempt but it's clearly not enough for like a a sort of scientific result we also like to descend out to descend out of a beta version to the people who took the survey one of the questions is sign up for the on the surface to sign up for a beta test for next year's team you definitely recruit more talent so if anyone is a student who wants to work on this or wants to work on an engine project and next year please come talk to me or or Jim and we can definitely get you involved if you're a faculty or staff we'd love to have you into this advisor we can use as much as much help as we can get of course we want protic had to win ijen definitely want to bring recognition to university and all the hard work that we that was done and all the support we've gotten from departments so far so we'd like to thank our supporters or sponsors immediately you guys the bank for next department and Ark we really appreciated opposite the advanced research computing yeah yeah we really appreciate all the support you guys have given us this year well we want to figure out how we can do more to help and help sustain this yeah I think it's really our goal you know we're partnering a lot with dark on a lot of things the guy runs that Eric Nicholson is through there he meets with me every week every Monday morning so there's some ways to would build from this yeah yeah of course we want to thank Jim and our other advisor Mark for for all their advice and their support you'll be able to you know this is fantastic start really thank you Jim for bringing this to us you know I know there's faculty sitting right here I know thank you all for listening oh wow look at that there was some half-naked guy with a wheelbarrow on a bunch of paint you know maybe 100 I mean they were like wondering what is that oh that's what it is you guys are yes that was so that was new this year it it was oh it was a lot about exploring the the appeal and beauty of of that can be created through synthetic biology and the winner was a I believe a team from France I think it was a university in Paris that created an artificial lemon and it was supposed to taste and smell like a real lemon but because actually he also has some new electronic product computational analysis yeah so one of the morning ideas um I didn't mentioned was to sort of have the modeling of the protocols results also attached to each protocol so maybe just even if it's just like a video at the end of the protocol that that shows the the simulates or shows what the expected results look like that would be a good way to share in review modeling in terms of sharing software it's that I think that would be a little a little harder files it can be parameters files like don't do the proteomics analysis you sounded like I said of course discover register one may say that 0.65 yeah I max I've actually been I've actually led the modeling and lab team math modeling and a lab team for for the past few years and I definitely interested in you know how we can integrate that if not if not it something something more advanced than just the comment system yeah it would it would be nice if if maybe when when you enter your parameters into the into a given particle I could predict certain parameter parameters one one it also be nice if like people who report that there was a easy way for people to report the results of their protocol in a standardized format so like they could enter like I did this protocol and this is the data from my results and they could share that and people who compare and maybe compare the the calculated parameters that from the different results so we're definitely definitely thinking more about about how we can expand to that so that that's a good idea you guys looked at electronic lab no folks you know we have one that we use in our lab called lab key it's in the open source it's really pretty good and it might be a way you know allow folks to you know in their own lab environments you know have something digital then could be probably pretty easy to aggregate up and share you have a certain part of it be viewed by I think we need him along of something like that is public it is you know we went through that I mean this is you could you could exist Alex here are expert but I think you could it's in the open source and you could configure it to expose it because I think one of the big contributors is this is that people get people figure out how to fix these problems but they just write it in their lab notebooks and nobody exactly so I'm trying to give that out and lab notebook so I know you showed a couple statistics on this before but how receptive were other people you reached out to towards the idea of sharing like there's specific labs protocols for you know for whatever field I mean because it seems like especially for like you know the most leading-edge stuff and like hyper competitive areas you know yeah it seems like you know everybody is trying to compete against each other especially in terms of what you talked about with like the nature of silent science papers and stuff you know they're trying to scoop everybody else so how do you foster an environment where even you know those labs in those so long competitive areas are we've surveyed the second most popular feature was being able to submit their submit their protocols so people want to share one thing I didn't mention was that the people that we talked to at the conference were very enthusiastic about this we're very enthusiastic about about being able to to use a system like this to be able to get help with with with what they were filling with and get feedback on their own protocols it's also a difference in the at the agent conference everything is open-source everybody's about sharing and come agree and the standard so that my brick can be used in your project next year it's an it's much more of an engineering model than it is a reclusive private lab view of things but I think to that point though as we get more and more into this reproducibility is an effective publication criteria then there's going to have to be places where you put your protocol so that they can be vetted and scored so that your you know your your data is reproducible I don't think it's going to be quite as easy I don't think the scientists are going to run to it but I think depending on the Mandate of the funding agencies and of the peer review process that may force people and then then you will have to have a system in place to do that I mean I don't think you'll change that culture overnight because some of those people are ingrained and I must keep my data secrets I don't get scooped so I get I get my paper it's part of the culture we've rewarded so I mean this is actually even a problem within I Jam so you there's not all teams completely adopt the open-source IBM philosophy there are a lot of teams who will say in the presentation I can't talk further about this because pending it's those email teams that have completely quit whoever refused to report at all anything because they were they instead of wanting to to patent their their project so that is still it's it's not that's not a problem that item is for you is it's even the founders have a couple of spin-off companies so I mean there's there is there has to be something that supports those kind of entrepreneurial endeavors great that was I just to follow on to the dry lab and the electronic lab notebook comments and something to people one of the things that we've started using for software is pipeline frameworks like Taverna or Loney where we set up tight line of tools and input the parameters and then the pipeline saves all of that information all the versions of everything all that can put values that we have and then we just share those files with each other so we know what versions of everything each other uses and what inputs each other use to run that pipeline and that might be something to add the but I mean the best part about about making this an open-source crowdsource project is that people want to implement features and go onto github and download the software and then make implement these features and and publish a better version so we're hoping that not only will we get a user community but also a dealt with developers going like my brand like to make that much like it's easy for me to just and I can put in my paper and done yeah then you'll just make it that much more that was the main reason I'm saying is those aspects of iterating you're looking at was main reason behind why we well we made sure to implement the URL for Yuja protocol and when I was at actually presented this poster at the the arc and like a library I got in touch a librarian came up and and I got in touch with with her about about the the current protocol commercial sort of called the other basis that that are currently being used so we're definitely we definitely in touch with those people and I have it in we had those contacts for for a future development illnesses for just you can't afford it and notes yeah that'd be great it's license it's all it's all public it's all it's all public domain open source is required by item our github our get our github group is my bot as mi e io s oft thank you guys
